TI  - Bioequivalence Study of 2 Formulations of Rivaroxaban, a Narrow-Therapeutic-Index 
      Drug, in Healthy Chinese Subjects Under Fasting and Fed Conditions.
PG  - 346-352

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the bioequivalence (BE) of 2 formulations of the 
      10-mg rivaroxaban tablet. The study was a randomized, open-label, 4-period, 
      crossover study that included 28 healthy subjects in fasting or fed conditions. 
      The pharmacokinetic parameters were determined based on the concentrations of 
      rivaroxaban using high-performance liquid chromatography with a tandem mass 
      spectrometer detector. In each of the 4 study periods with fasting or fed 
      conditions, a single dose of test or reference product was administered. 
      Rivaroxaban concentrations in plasma were determined using a validated liquid 
      chromatography with a tandem mass spectrometer detector method. The 
      pharmacokinetic parameters assessed were the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC(0-t) , AUC(0-∞) ), the peak plasma concentration of 
      the drug (C(max) ), time to achieve C(max) , elimination half-life, 
      within-subject variability of test drug, and within-subject variability of 
      reference drug. The geometric mean ratio (90%CI) of the test drug/reference drug 
      for rivaroxaban was 90.38% to 103.60% for AUC(0-t) in fasting conditions and 
      90.13% to 100.42% in fed conditions. The AUC(0-∞) s were 89.94% to 102.50% and 
      90.14% to 100.45% under fasting and fed conditions, respectively. The C(max) 
      values were 90.58% to 105.01% and 96.36% to 108.07% in these 2 conditions, 
      respectively. All 90%CIs for test drug/reference drug geometric mean ratio were 
      ≤2.5. The 90%CIs for test/reference AUC ratio and C(max) ratio were within the 
      acceptable range for BE. There were no adverse events encountered during this BE 
      study. The study's results indicated that the 2 formulations of the rivaroxaban 
      tablet were bioequivalent.

TI  - Dose-escalation study of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban 
      in healthy elderly subjects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban--a novel, oral, direct Factor Xa (FXa) 
      inhibitor--in healthy elderly subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this 
      single-centre, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-escalation 
      study, 48 subjects (aged 60-76 years) were randomized to receive a single oral 
      dose of 30, 40 or 50 mg of rivaroxaban or placebo. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban was 
      absorbed rapidly, reaching peak plasma concentration (C(max)) 4 h after dosing in 
      all groups. Bioavailability, in terms of the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) and C(max), increased slightly (less than dose 
      proportionally) after administration of rivaroxaban 40 mg compared with 30 mg, 
      but was not increased further with rivaroxaban 50 mg. Rivaroxaban pharmacodynamic 
      effects (inhibition of FXa activity and prolongation of prothrombin time, 
      activated partial thromboplastin time and HepTest) all showed a similar pattern, 
      with maximum inhibition of FXa activity increasing from 68% after rivaroxaban 30 
      mg to 75% after 40 mg and no further increase with the 50 mg dose. Most adverse 
      events were mild; observed rates were less than placebo for the 30 and 40 mg dose 
      groups, and similar to placebo for 50 mg. No differences were found between male 
      and female subjects. Effects of rivaroxaban doses above 50 mg were not 
      investigated in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Each single dose of rivaroxaban was well 
      tolerated, with predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics at doses up to 
      40 mg, and provided effective anticoagulation in healthy elderly subjects. 
      Adverse events were somewhat elevated in the 50 mg group, but given the small 
      sample size, no specific conclusions can be drawn about this dosing level.

TI  - Population model of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban--an 
      oral, direct factor xa inhibitor--in healthy subjects.
PG  - 335-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) is an oral, direct Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor 
      being developed for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. 
      This analysis aimed to define population models for the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
      pharmacodynamics (PD) ofrivaroxaban in healthy males. METHODS: Non-linear, 
      mixed-effect modeling was used to analyze rivaroxaban plasma concentration and PD 
      data (FXa activity and clotting tests) from subjects in a phase I, 
      multiple-ascending-dose study. Subjects received 5 mg rivaroxaban once, twice or 
      three times daily, or 10, 20 or 30 mg rivaroxaban twice daily. RESULTS: The 
      population PK of rivaroxaban were well described by an oral, two-compartment 
      model with first-order absorption and elimination from the central compartment. 
      Population mean estimates for apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution 
      for the central compartment were 9.2 1/h and 55 1, respectively, with moderate 
      inter-individual variability (17.4% and 30.7%, respectively). Total volume of 
      distribution for rivaroxaban at steady state was approximately 70 1. Residual 
      (unexplained) variability was 25%. FXa activity correlated with rivaroxaban 
      plasma concentrations following an inhibitory Emax model; prothrombin time (PT) 
      and rivaroxaban plasma concentrations correlated with a linear model, with a 
      slope of 4.6 s/(100 microg/1). Inter-individual variability was low for the 
      correlation with PT. The models derived were used to define sampling windows for 
      population PK/PD modeling in Phase II studies. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis 
      confirms that rivaroxaban has predictable, dose-proportional PK and PD. The 
      linear correlation between rivaroxaban plasma concentrations and PT suggests that 
      this test might be useful to assess rivaroxaban exposure in patients, if 
      required.

LID - 10.2147/CPAA.S61131 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, there are no direct comparisons of apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban, two new oral direct factor Xa inhibitors approved for management of 
      thromboembolic disorders. OBJECTIVE: Compare the pharmacokinetics and anti-factor 
      Xa activity (AXA) of apixaban and rivaroxaban. METHODS: In this randomized, 
      open-label, two-period, two-treatment crossover study, healthy subjects (N=14) 
      received apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily (BID) and rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily (QD) 
      for 4 days with a ≥4.5-day washout. Plasma samples were obtained for 
      pharmacokinetic and AXA assessments; parameters were calculated using 
      noncompartmental methods. RESULTS: Median time-to-maximum concentration was 2 
      hours for both compounds, and the mean half-life was 8.7 and 7.9 hours for 
      apixaban and rivaroxaban, respectively. Daily exposure, the area under the curve 
      (AUC(0-24)), appeared similar for rivaroxaban (1,094 ng · h/mL) and apixaban (935 
      ng · h/mL), whereas mean peak-to-trough plasma concentration ratio was 3.6-fold 
      greater for rivaroxaban (16.9) than apixaban (4.7). Coefficient of variation for 
      exposure parameters (AUC0-24, Cmax, Cmin) was 20%-24% for apixaban versus 29%-46% 
      for rivaroxaban. Peak AXA, AXA AUC(0-24), and AXA fluctuation were ~2.5-, 1.3-, 
      and 3.5-fold higher for rivaroxaban than apixaban, respectively. Trough 
      concentrations and AXA were lower for rivaroxaban (10 ng/mL and 0.17 IU/mL vs 17 
      ng/mL and 0.24 IU/mL for apixaban, respectively). Rivaroxaban exhibited a steeper 
      concentration-AXA response (slope: 0.0172 IU/ng vs 0.0134 IU/ng for apixaban, 
      P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Apixaban 2.5 mg BID demonstrated less intersubject 
      variability in exposure, lower AXA AUC, and higher trough and smaller 
      peak-to-trough fluctuations in plasma concentration and AXA, suggesting more 
      constant anticoagulation compared with rivaroxaban 10 mg QD. However, the 
      clinical impact of these differences on the relative efficacy and safety of 
      apixaban and rivaroxaban remains to be determined.

LID - 10.1159/000445328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) 
      and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of rivaroxaban 15 mg administered before and 
      after dialysis in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and to compare 
      this profile in subjects with ESRD to that in healthy control subjects 
      (creatinine clearance ≥80 ml/min). METHODS: This was an open-label, single-dose, 
      single-center, parallel-group study of rivaroxaban in ESRD subjects who had been 
      clinically stable on maintenance hemodialysis for ≥3 months. In 8 subjects with 
      ESRD, a 15-mg dose of rivaroxaban was administered 2 ± 0.5 h before a 
      hemodialysis session and repeated 7-14 days later at 3 h after a 4-h hemodialysis 
      session. Eight healthy control subjects, matched for age, sex, and body mass 
      index, received one 15-mg rivaroxaban dose. RESULTS: Compared to healthy 
      subjects, area under the rivaroxaban plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) 
      increased by 56% following post-dialysis administration. Assuming similar 
      bioavailability between groups, this reflects an approximate 35% decrease in 
      overall drug clearance in ESRD subjects. Pre-dialysis dosing resulted in only 5% 
      lowering of AUC versus post-dialysis dosing, confirming the minimal impact of 
      dialysis on the PK of rivaroxaban. PD effects, as assessed by change in 
      prothrombin time, percent factor Xa inhibition, and anti-Xa activity, were 
      generally concordant with observed changes in plasma PK. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in 
      PK and PD parameters in chronic dialysis patients were generally comparable to 
      changes observed previously in patients with moderate-to-severe renal impairment 
      who were not undergoing dialysis, and support use of a 15-mg dose in this patient 
      population.

TI  - Effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety 
      of rivaroxaban, an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor.
PG  - 703-12
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2010.03753.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study evaluated the effects of impaired renal function on the 
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of rivaroxaban (10mg single dose), 
      an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor. METHODS: Subjects (n= 32) were stratified 
      based on measured creatinine clearance: healthy controls (≥80ml min(-1) ), mild 
      (50-79mlmin(-1) ), moderate (30-49mlmin(-1) ) and severe impairment (<30mlmin(-1) 
      ). RESULTS: Renal clearance of rivaroxaban decreased with increasing renal 
      impairment. Thus, plasma concentrations increased and area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) LS-mean values were 1.44-fold (90% confidence 
      interval [CI] 1.1, 1.9; mild), 1.52-fold (90% CI 1.2, 2.0; moderate) and 
      1.64-fold (90% CI 1.2, 2.2; severe impairment) higher than in healthy controls. 
      Corresponding values for the LS-mean of the AUC for prolongation of prothrombin 
      time were 1.33-fold (90% CI 0.92, 1.92; mild), 2.16-fold (90% CI 1.51, 3.10 
      moderate) and 2.44-fold (90% CI 1.70, 3.49 severe) higher than in healthy 
      subjects, respectively. Likewise, the LS-mean of the AUC for Factor Xa inhibition 
      in subjects with mild renal impairment was 1.50-fold (90% CI 1.07, 2.10) higher 
      than in healthy subjects. In subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment, 
      the increase was 1.86-fold (90% CI 1.34, 2.59) and 2.0-fold (90% CI 1.44, 2.78) 
      higher than in healthy subjects, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Rivaroxaban clearance 
      is decreased with increasing renal impairment, leading to increased plasma 
      exposure and pharmacodynamic effects, as expected for a partially renally 
      excreted drug. However, the influence of renal function on rivaroxaban clearance 
      was moderate, even in subjects with severe renal impairment.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of once- and twice-daily 
      rivaroxaban for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing 
      total hip replacement.
PG  - 453-61
AB  - Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor in advanced clinical 
      development for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. The aim 
      was to compare the population pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 
      twice-daily (bid) and once-daily (od) rivaroxaban in patients undergoing total 
      hip replacement (THR). Blood samples were collected from patients enrolled in two 
      phase IIb, dose-ranging studies undertaken to investigate rivaroxaban for 
      thromboprophylaxis after THR. A sparse sampling technique was used and the 
      samples were pooled for PK and PD analysis, which used non-linear mixed effect 
      modelling. Rivaroxaban PK (samples from 758 patients) were well described by an 
      oral, one-compartment model; age and renal function influenced clearance, and 
      body surface area affected volume of distribution. When comparing the same total 
      daily doses, maximum plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban were higher and minimum 
      plasma concentrations were lower with od dosing, compared with bid dosing; 
      however, the 90% intervals overlapped. The area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve was 18-30% higher in the od than in the bid study. 
      Prothrombin time in seconds (samples from 1181 patients) correlated with 
      rivaroxaban plasma concentrations in a linear fashion in both studies. In 
      conclusion, the PK and PD of rivaroxaban were predictable when given either bid 
      or od. These findings, along with the suggested efficacy and safety of 
      rivaroxaban in the phase II studies, relative to enoxaparin, supported the 
      selection of a convenient, once-daily 10 mg rivaroxaban dose for investigation in 
      phase III studies.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single doses of rivaroxaban in obese 
      patients prior to and after bariatric surgery.
PG  - 1466-1475
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13243 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Venous thromboembolism is an important cause of postoperative morbidity and 
      mortality in bariatric surgery. Studies of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are 
      not available in this surgical field. The objective of this phase 1 clinical 
      trial was to investigate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters 
      of rivaroxaban in bariatric patients. METHODS: In this single-centre study, obese 
      patients received single oral doses of rivaroxaban (10 mg) 1 day prior to and 
      3 days after bariatric surgery. PK and PD parameters were assessed at baseline 
      and during 24 h after drug ingestion. RESULTS: Six Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
      patients and six sleeve gastrectomy patients completed the study. Mean 
      rivaroxaban area under plasma concentration-time curve, peak plasma 
      concentration, time to peak plasma concentration and terminal half-life were 
      971.9 μg·h l(-1) (coefficient of variation: 10.6), 135.3 μg l(-1) (26.7), 1.5 h 
      and 13.1 h (34.1) prior to and 1165.8 (21.9), 170.0 (15.9), 1.5 and 8.9 (44.6) 
      postsurgery for SG patients and 933.7 μg·h l(-1) (22.3), 136.5 μg l(-1) (10.7), 
      1.5 h und 13.8 h (46.6) prior to and 1029.4 (7.4), 110.8 (31.8), 2.5 and 15 
      (60.0) postsurgery for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients, respectively. 
      Prothrombin fragments (F1 + 2) decreased during the first 12 hours and increased 
      thereafter in the pre- and the postbariatric setting. Thrombin-antithrombin 
      complexes dropped within 1-3 h in the prebariatric setting and remained low after 
      surgery until they increased at 24 h postdose. Rivaroxaban was well tolerated and 
      no relevant safety issues were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery does not 
      appear to alter PK of rivaroxaban in a clinically relevant way. Effective 
      prophylactic postbariatric anticoagulation is supported by changes in PD.

TI  - Effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a 
      single dose of rivaroxaban, an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor.
PG  - 89-98
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12054 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study investigated the effects of hepatic impairment on the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of rivaroxaban (10 mg), an 
      oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor. METHOD: This single centre, non-randomized, 
      non-blinded study included subjects with mild (n = 8) or moderate hepatic 
      impairment (n = 8), according to the Child-Pugh classification, and 
      gender-matched healthy subjects (n = 16). RESULTS: Rivaroxaban was well tolerated 
      irrespective of hepatic function. Mild hepatic impairment did not significantly 
      affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban, compared with 
      healthy subjects. However, in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, total 
      body clearance was decreased, leading to a significant increase in the area under 
      the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). The least-squares (LS)-mean values for 
      AUC were 1.15-fold [90% confidence interval (CI) 0.85, 1.57] and 2.27-fold (90% 
      CI 1.68, 3.07) higher in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, 
      respectively, than in healthy subjects. Consequently, the pharmacodynamic 
      responses were significantly enhanced in subjects with moderate hepatic 
      impairment. For inhibition of Factor Xa, increases in the area under the 
      effect-time curve and the maximum effect were observed, with LS-mean ratios of 
      2.59 and 1.24, respectively, vs. healthy subjects. Prolongation of prothrombin 
      time was similar in healthy subjects and those with mild hepatic impairment, but 
      was significantly enhanced in those with moderate hepatic impairment. CONCLUSION: 
      Moderate (but not mild) hepatic impairment reduced total body clearance of 
      rivaroxaban after a single 10 mg dose, leading to increased rivaroxaban exposure 
      and pharmacodynamic effects.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of BAY 59-7939--an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor--in rats and 
      dogs.
PG  - 891-910
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of BAY 59-7939 - a novel, oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor - 
      were investigated in rats and dogs in support of preclinical safety studies and 
      clinical development. BAY 59-7939 was rapidly absorbed after oral dosing, with an 
      absolute bioavailability of 57-66% in rats, and 60-86% in dogs. Plasma 
      pharmacokinetics of BAY 59-7939 were linear across the investigated dose range 
      (1-10 mg kg(-1) in rats, 0.3-3 mg kg(-1) in dogs). Plasma clearance was low: 0.4 
      l kg(-1) h(-1) in rats and 0.3 l kg(-1) h(-1) in dogs; volume of distribution 
      (V(ss)) was moderate: 0.3 l kg(-1) in rats, and 0.4 l kg(-1) in dogs. The 
      elimination half-life after oral administration was short in both species 
      (0.9-2.3 h). Whole-body autoradiography showed moderate tissue affinity. No 
      retention or small volume enrichments of BAY 59-7939-related radioactivity were 
      observed. The plasma-protein binding of BAY 59-7939 was high, species dependent 
      and fully reversible. BAY 59-7939 was rapidly excreted in rats and dogs, and was 
      not irreversibly retained. A dual mode of excretion (biliary/faecal and renal) 
      was observed. In summary, BAY 59-7939 had a favourable, predictable 
      pharmacokinetic profile, with high oral bioavailability and a dual route of 
      excretion.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban in patients with short 
      bowel syndrome requiring parenteral nutrition: The PDER PAN study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients on parenteral nutrition for short bowel syndrome 
      (SBS) have a high risk of thrombotic complications and are often treated with 
      parenteral anticoagulation. Direct oral anticoagulants are absorbed proximally in 
      the digestive tract and may represent alternative regimens in selected SBS 
      patients. In our pilot study, we provided pharmacokinetics parameters of 
      dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban in this setting and compared peak (Cmax), 
      trough (Ctrough) concentrations, and areas-under-the-concentration-time-curve 
      (AUC(0-t)) to reference values retrieved from phase I-III studies. METHODS: We 
      enrolled 6 adults with a remaining small bowel length≤200cm, normal renal/hepatic 
      function, and intact stomach. In our crossover study, patients were exposed to 
      twice-daily dabigatran etexilate 150mg and once-daily rivaroxaban 20mg. RESULTS: 
      After 5days of dabigatran dosing, Ctrough and Cmax geometric means were 39μg/L 
      (90% CI: 23-66) and 88μg/L (90% CI: 56-137), respectively; AUC(0-12h) was 
      958μg∗h/L (90% CI: 635-1445). After 5days of rivaroxaban dosing, Ctrough and Cmax 
      geometric means were 9μg/L (90% CI: 1-71) and 167μg/L (90% CI: 102-276), 
      respectively; AUC(0-24h) was 1720μg∗h/L (90% CI: 899-3300). Absorption was 
      negligible in one patient with ultra-short (~15cm) bowel. For dabigatran, Cmax 
      ratio was 0.57 (SD 0.33) and Ctrough ratio was 0.35 (SD 0.44). For rivaroxaban, 
      the mean observed-to-reference ratios AUC(0-24h) and Cmax ratios were 0.73 (SD 
      0.32) and 0.76 (SD 0.34), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: While in SBS patients there 
      is some absorption of the oral anticoagulants dabigatran etexilate and 
      rivaroxaban, it appears to be lower than reference values. Plasma drug levels 
      showed significant inter-individual variability.

AB  - CONTEXT: Rivaroxaban and ticagrelor are two common drugs for the treatment of 
      atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome. However, the drug-drug 
      interaction between them is still unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects 
      of ticagrelor on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in rats both in vivo and 
      in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sensitive and reliable UPLC-MS/MS method was 
      developed for the determination of rivaroxaban in rat plasma. Ten Sprague-Dawley 
      rats were randomly divided into ticagrelor pre-treated group (10 mg/kg/day for 
      14 days) and control group. The pharmacokinetics of orally administered 
      rivaroxaban (10 mg/kg, single dose) with or without ticagrelor pre-treatment was 
      investigated with developed UPLC-MS/MS method. Additionally, Sprague-Dawley rat 
      liver microsomes were also used to investigate the drug-drug interaction between 
      these two drugs in vitro. RESULTS: The C (max) (221.34 ± 53.33 vs. 
      691.18 ± 238.31 ng/mL) and the AUC((0-t)) (1060.97 ± 291.21 vs. 
      3483.03 ± 753.83 μg·h/L) of rivaroxaban increased significantly (p < 0.05) with 
      ticagrelor pre-treatment. The MRT((0-∞)) of rivaroxaban increased from 
      4.41 ± 0.79 to 5.97 ± 1.11 h, while the intrinsic clearance decreased from 
      9.93 ± 2.55 to 2.89 ± 0.63 L/h/kg (both p < 0.05) after pre-treated with 
      ticagrelor. Enzyme kinetic study indicated that ticagrelor decreased rivaroxaban 
      metabolic clearance with the IC(50) value of 14.04 μmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      in vivo and in vitro results demonstrated that there is a drug-drug interaction 
      between ticagrelor and rivaroxaban in rats. Further studies need to be carried 
      out to verify whether similar interactions truly apply in humans and whether 
      these interactions have clinical significance.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      rivaroxaban, an oral, direct Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor, in healthy, male Chinese 
      subjects. METHODS: Two randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, 
      dose-escalation studies were conducted in healthy Chinese men aged 18-45 years. 
      In the single-dose study, subjects received single, oral doses of rivaroxaban 
      2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg. In the multiple-dose study, oral rivaroxaban was 
      administered in doses of 5, 10, 20 and 30 mg twice daily for 6 days. RESULTS: 
      Rivaroxaban, in single and multiple doses up to 60 mg, was well tolerated. Rapid 
      absorption was observed in both studies (time to C(max) 1.25-2.5 h). In the 
      multiple-dose study, rivaroxaban exposure increased dose-proportionally after the 
      first dose and at steady state (for the 5-20-mg doses). The half-life of 
      rivaroxaban was up to 7.9 h in the single-dose study. Maximal inhibition of FXa 
      activity was achieved within 1-3 h of dosing in the single-dose study [at 20 mg 
      FXa inhibition as a median percentage change from baseline, 45.92; 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 44.64, 50.70] and 2-3 h after administration at steady state in the 
      multiple-dose study (at 20 mg median FXa inhibition as a median percentage change 
      from baseline, 60.25; 95% CI 56.16, 63.05), in line with maximum rivaroxaban 
      plasma concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Rivaroxaban demonstrated predictable 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy Chinese subjects, in line with 
      findings observed previously in White subjects. This suggests that fixed doses of 
      rivaroxaban may be administered to all patients, regardless of their ethnic 
      origin.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is a novel, oral, direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor for the prevention 
      and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 
      rivaroxaban in healthy, elderly Chinese subjects. In this single-centre, 
      single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-escalation study, 79 
      subjects, aged 59-74years (mean 62.8), were randomised to receive once-daily oral 
      doses of rivaroxaban 5, 10, 20, 30 or 40mg. Rivaroxaban was well tolerated: there 
      was a low incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and all events were of 
      mild intensity. Rivaroxaban was absorbed rapidly, reaching maximum plasma 
      concentrations within 2-4hours. The PK of rivaroxaban were dose dependent over 
      the dose range tested. Maximal inhibition of FXa occurred 2-3hours after dosing 
      and returned to baseline after 24-48hours, reflecting rivaroxaban plasma 
      concentrations. Inhibition of FXa was associated with dose-dependent effects on 
      global clotting tests. There were no clinically relevant differences in 
      rivaroxaban plasma concentrations between male and female subjects. In 
      conclusion, rivaroxaban was well tolerated and was found to have predictable PK 
      and PD in healthy, elderly Chinese subjects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The EINSTEIN-Jr program will evaluate rivaroxaban for the treatment 
      of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children, targeting exposures similar to the 
      20 mg once-daily dose for adults. METHODS: This was a multinational, single-dose,

      (PK) and safety of a single bodyweight-adjusted rivaroxaban dose in children aged 
      0.5-18 years. Children who had completed treatment for a venous thromboembolic 
      event were enrolled into four age groups (0.5-2 years, 2-6 years, 6-12 years and 
      12-18 years) receiving rivaroxaban doses equivalent to 10 mg or 20 mg (either as 
      a tablet or oral suspension). Blood samples for PK and PD analyses were collected 
      within specified time windows. RESULTS: Fifty-nine children were evaluated. In 
      all age groups, PD parameters (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin 
      time and anti-Factor Xa activity) showed a linear relationship versus rivaroxaban 
      plasma concentrations and were in line with previously acquired adult data, as 
      well as in vitro spiking experiments. The rivaroxaban pediatric physiologically 
      based pharmacokinetic model, used to predict the doses for the individual body 
      weight groups, was confirmed. No episodes of bleeding were reported, and 
      treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in four children and all resolved 
      during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Bodyweight-adjusted, single-dose rivaroxaban had 
      predictable PK/PD profiles in children across all age groups from 0.5 to 
      18 years. The PD assessments based on prothrombin time and activated partial 
      thromboplastin time demonstrated that the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban was 
      not affected by developmental hemostasis in children. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Doses of 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg of rivaroxaban are approved for the 
      treatment and prevention of thromboembolic disorders in adult patients. In six 
      Phase I studies, the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 
      10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg rivaroxaban were investigated in healthy male subjects, 
      and the influence of food on these parameters was investigated for the 10 mg, 15 
      mg, and 20 mg tablet doses. In addition, an oral suspension containing 1 mg/ml 
      rivaroxaban, which is under investigation for future use in the pediatric 
      population, was investigated at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. MATERIALS: Rivaroxaban 
      was obtained from Bayer Pharma AG, Wuppertal, Germany. METHODS: Six independent, 
      single-dose, cross-over studies were performed in healthy male subjects (between 
      13 and 24 subjects were enrolled in each study) to determine the 
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of rivaroxaban under fasting and fed 
      conditions. Study 1 was an absolute bioavailability study that compared 5 mg and 
      20 mg tablet doses with a 1 mg intravenous solution. Studies 2 and 3 were 
      confirmatory food-effect studies that assessed 10 mg and 20 mg tablet doses, 
      respectively, under fed and fasting conditions. Study 4 was a formulation study 
      that evaluated oral suspensions of 10 mg (fasting) and 20 mg (fasting and fed) 
      rivaroxaban vs. a 10 mg tablet (fasted). Study 5 was a dose-proportionality study 
      that assessed 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. Study 6 
      was a dose-proportionality study that assessed tablet doses of 10 mg, 15 mg, and 
      20 mg under fed conditions. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including the area under 
      the plasma concentration-time curve after a single dose, the maximum drug 
      concentration in plasma after a single dose, dose-adjusted values of area under 
      the plasma concentration-time curve and maximum drug concentration in plasma 
      after a single dose, half-life associated with the terminal slope, and time to 
      maximum concentration in plasma after a single dose were evaluated. Adverse 
      events were classified according to their degree of severity and were summarized 
      using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms. RESULTS: At 
      all doses, rivaroxaban showed an acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated 
      in healthy individuals. Independent of food and formulation, pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of doses up to 10 mg rivaroxaban were dose proportional and had high 
      oral bioavailability (≥ 80%). Under fasting conditions, pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of 15 mg and 20 mg rivaroxaban increased with dose but were less than 
      dose proportional. However, when taken with food, high bioavailability (≥ 80%) of 
      these doses was achieved independent of formulation. CONCLUSION: Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of doses up to 10 mg rivaroxaban were dose proportional and had high 
      oral bioavailability independent of food or whether administered as tablet or 
      solution. High bioavailability (≥ 80%) of 15 mg and 20 mg rivaroxaban was 
      achieved when taken with food; therefore, these doses need to be taken with food.

AB  - PURPOSE: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are recommended in preference to 
      vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for stroke prevention in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) eligible for oral anticoagulation therapy; however, data and 
      clinical experiences supporting the use of DOACs in patients with a body mass 
      index ≥40 kg/m(2) or weight >120 kg remain limited. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of DOACs in patients with AF and extreme 
      obesity. METHODS: We enrolled all consecutive patients with AF and extreme 
      obesity undergoing treatment with DOACs followed up at Monaldi Hospital, Naples, 
      Italy. To determine peak plasma and trough levels of DOACs, plasma samples were 
      collected at 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 12th hours from the last dose intake in patients 
      receiving apixaban and dabigatran and at the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 24th hours in 
      those receiving edoxaban and rivaroxaban. The DOACs' peak and trough plasma 
      levels obtained from our study population were compared with those sourced from 
      pharmacokinetic studies among patients without obesity, defined as a normal 
      reference range in the literature. If at least 1 peak or trough plasma level was 
      found ​​below or above the normal reference ranges, the patients were classified 
      as having out-of-range DOAC plasma levels. Study population was then divided into 
      in-range and out-of-range groups. Baseline characteristics, including DOAC 
      treatment, were compared between the 2 groups. Univariate and multivariate 
      logistic regression analysis were performed to identify baseline variables 
      associated with DOACs' plasma concentration out of the expected range. FINDINGS: 
      A total of 58 patients (mean [SD] age, 70.93 [8.73] years; 40% female) with 
      extreme obesity (mean [SD] body mass index. 44.43 [3.54] kg/m(2)) and AF while 
      undergoing DOAC treatment were included in the present study. In 9 patients (15.5 
      %), the DOAC plasma concentrations were out of the expected ranges (out-of-range 
      group);, indicating a greater likelihood of edoxaban 30 mg treatment (33% vs 2%; 
      P < 0.01) and inappropriate DOAC underdosing (56% vs 4%; P < 0.005) compared with 
      the in-range group. According to the multivariate logistic analysis (P = 0.0011), 
      the inappropriate DOAC underdosing (hazard ratio = 29.37; P = 0.0002) was an 
      independent predictor of DOAC plasma levels out of the expected ranges. 
      IMPLICATIONS: Patients with extreme obesity and AF who were receiving DOAC 
      therapy had DOAC plasma concentrations in the expected range. The inappropriate 
      DOAC underdosing seems to be the only independent clinical factor associated with 
      a plasma concentration of the drug out of the expected range.

PG  - 1466-1474
LID - 10.1111/bcp.14553 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the influence of a cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and efflux 
      transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inducing Hypericum perforatum extract on the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban. METHODS: Open-label, 
      nonrandomized, sequential treatment interaction study. Following CYP3A4 and P-gp 
      phenotyping using low-dose midazolam and fexofenadine, 12 healthy volunteers 
      received a single oral dose of 20 mg rivaroxaban and rivaroxaban plasma 
      concentrations and inhibition of the activated coagulation factor X (factor Xa) 
      activity were measured prior to and up to 48 h postdosing. The procedures were 
      repeated after 2 weeks' treatment with the H. perforatum extract. RESULTS: The 
      geometric mean ratios for the area under the concentration-time curve and C(max) 
      of rivaroxaban after/before induction with the H. perforatum extract were 0.76 
      (90% confidence interval [CI] 0.70, 0.82) and 0.86 (90% CI 0.76, 0.97), 
      respectively. Inhibition of factor Xa activity was reduced with a geometric mean 
      area under the effect-time curve ratio after/before induction of 0.80 (90% CI 
      0.71, 0.89). No clinically significant differences were found regarding T(max) 
      (median 1.5 vs 1 h, P = .26) and terminal elimination half-life (mean 10.6 vs 
      10.8 h, P = .93) of rivaroxaban. The H. perforatum extract significantly induced 
      CYP3A4 and P-gp activity, as evidenced by phenotyping. CONCLUSION: The 
      CYP3A4/P-gp inducing H. perforatum extract caused a decrease of rivaroxaban 
      exposure with a proportional decrease of the pharmacodynamic effect. Although the 
      data do not justify a contraindication for the combination or a systematic 
      adjustment of rivaroxaban dosage, avoidance of the combination or laboratory 
      monitoring should be considered in patients taking hyperforin-containing H. 
      perforatum extracts with rivaroxaban.

TI  - Safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of single doses of BAY 59-7939, an 
      oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor.
PG  - 412-21
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is a clinical need for new oral anticoagulants to 
      prevent and treat thromboembolic diseases. Given its integral role in the 
      coagulation cascade, factor Xa is a particularly promising target for new 
      anticoagulation therapies. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety, 
      pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of BAY 59--7939, an oral, direct factor Xa 
      inhibitor. METHODS: This single-center, randomized, single-blinded, 
      placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study included 108 healthy white male 
      subjects aged 19 to 45 years. Subjects received single oral doses of either BAY 
      59--7939 (1.25--80 mg) or placebo; in addition, 1 group received 2 doses of BAY 
      59--7939 (5--mg tablet and oral solution) or placebo in a crossover design. 
      RESULTS: Oral BAY 59--7939 in single doses up to 80 mg was safe and well 
      tolerated and was not associated with an increased risk of bleeding compared with 
      placebo. Pharmacodynamic effects (inhibition of factor Xa activity, prothrombin 
      time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and Hep Test) and plasma 
      concentration profiles were dose-dependent. Maximum inhibition of factor Xa 
      activity was achieved 1 to 4 hours after administration of BAY 59--7939 and 
      ranged from 20% to 61% for the 5- to 80-mg doses. BAY 59--7939 selectively 
      inhibited factor Xa activity; thrombin (factor IIa) and antithrombin were 
      unaffected. Inhibition of factor Xa activity and prolongation of prothrombin time 
      correlated well with BAY 59--7939 plasma concentrations (r=0.949 and 0.935, 
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: BAY 59--7939 was well tolerated with predictable 
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics across a wide range of doses in healthy 
      male subjects. BAY 59--7939 was shown to be an effective and specific factor Xa 
      inhibitor.

      rivaroxaban--an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor.
PG  - 249-55

AB  - A randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was 
      conducted to assess the effect of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban - an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor. Subjects 
      (n = 34) were enrolled into four groups: young males or females (aged 18-45 
      years) and elderly males or females (aged >75 years), and received a single dose 
      of 10 mg rivaroxaban. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were 
      determined. Gender had no significant influence on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban. The area under the concentration-time curve 
      (AUC) of rivaroxaban was 41% higher in elderly compared with young subjects; 
      corresponding AUC values for the inhibition of Factor Xa activity and 
      prolongation of prothrombin time were also higher. These changes were the result 
      of reduced rivaroxaban clearance in elderly subjects, mainly owing to decreased 
      renal function. The influence of age was not considered clinically relevant. The 
      maximum plasma concentration was not increased in elderly subjects, and 
      pharmacodynamic parameters returned close to baseline within 24 hours. The 
      results indicate that age alone and gender did not have a clinically relevant 
      effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in healthy 
      subjects after a 10 mg dose.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of oral rivaroxaban in healthy 
      adult cats.
PG  - 619-29
LID - 10.1111/vec.12524 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban 
      (RVX), in healthy cats and to evaluate the clinicopathologic effects of various 
      plasma RVX concentrations within target therapeutic ranges established for 
      people. DESIGN: Prospective randomized cross-over study performed between July 
      2013 and November 2014. SETTING: Veterinary university teaching hospital. 
      ANIMALS: Six healthy adult domestic shorthair cats (3 males, 3 females). 
      INTERVENTIONS: Cats were treated with oral RVX at single, fixed doses (1.25, 2.5, 
      5 mg PO), q 12 h for 3 days (1.25 mg); q 24 h for 7 days (2.5 mg); and q 24 h for 
      28 days (1.25 mg). Blood samples were collected for complete blood count, blood 
      chemistry, and RVX anticoagulant activity based on prolongation of dilute 
      prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), activated Factor 
      X (FXa) inhibition (anti-Xa activity [aXa]) and high-pressure liquid 
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometry determination of drug concentration. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Treated cats had no signs of hemorrhage or 
      clinicopathologic off-target adverse effects. There were dose-dependent 
      prolongations of coagulation times and increase in aXa, with peak effect at 3 
      hours postadministration. There was a direct correlation between plasma RVX 
      concentration and dilute prothrombin time and aXa. Coagulation parameters 
      returned to baseline by 24 hours after the last dose. CONCLUSIONS: Oral RVX was 
      well tolerated by healthy cats with predictable pharmacokinetics and 
      anticoagulant effects. Clinical studies of RVX are warranted in cats with heart 
      disease.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of the Nonvitamin K Antagonist Oral 
      Anticoagulant Edoxaban When Administered Alone or After Switching from 
      Rivaroxaban or Dabigatran Etexilate in Healthy Subjects.
PG  - 127-36
LID - 10.1007/s40261-015-0357-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Edoxaban is an oral, once-daily direct factor Xa 
      inhibitor. To support the possibility that patients may choose to switch 
      treatment from another nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant to edoxaban, 
      this clinical study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic effects of edoxaban after switching from rivaroxaban or 
      dabigatran etexilate to edoxaban. METHODS: In this open-label, three-period, 
      crossover study, healthy subjects received 3 days of edoxaban 60 mg daily, 
      rivaroxaban 20 mg daily, or dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily, followed by 
      edoxaban 60 mg on day 4. RESULTS: Day 4 edoxaban pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      similar for all treatments. The peak effect of edoxaban on prothrombin time (PT) 
      after 4 days of edoxaban only was 21.8 ± 2.46 s; after switching from rivaroxaban 
      to edoxaban, peak effect on PT was similar at 21.8 ± 2.88 s. After switching from 
      dabigatran etexilate to edoxaban, least squares mean activated partial 
      thromboplastin time (aPTT) at 2 h after administration was 47.6 vs 35.0 s for 
      edoxaban alone. The treatment difference was 12.8 s (95% confidence interval 
      10.5-15.1; p < 0.0001). Post hoc analysis revealed that predose aPTT was elevated 
      on day 3 of dabigatran etexilate administration, and on day 4, indicating a 
      carryover effect from dabigatran. All treatments were well tolerated and there 
      were no safety concerns upon switching, with no increased risk of bleeding. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that switching to edoxaban from either 
      rivaroxaban or dabigatran etexilate at the time of the next dose is well 
      tolerated and maintains coagulation status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of vitamin K antagonists for the prevention of stroke and 
      systemic embolism in dialysis patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is 
      controversial. However, no good alternatives presently are available. The 
      anti-factor Xa antagonist rivaroxaban is contraindicated for lack of 
      pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and clinical data. This study aims to 
      characterize the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in maintenance 
      hemodialysis patients. STUDY DESIGN: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study. 
      SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 18 maintenance hemodialysis patients without residual 
      kidney function at 2 centers. DRUG ADMINISTRATION, OUTCOMES, & MEASUREMENTS: (1) 
      A single dose of 10mg of rivaroxaban was administered at the end of each of 3 
      consecutive dialysis sessions and area under the curve (AUC) and the effect on 
      coagulation parameters were measured for 44 hours thereafter. (2) A single dose 
      of 10mg of rivaroxaban was given 6 to 8 hours before a dialysis session and the 
      effect of dialysis on rivaroxaban concentrations was evaluated. (3) To assess 
      potential accumulation, 10mg of rivaroxaban was given once daily and AUC was 
      measured during 24 hours on days 1 and 7. RESULTS: Mean AUC0-44 of rivaroxaban 
      plasma concentrations after a single dose of 10mg was 2,072μg/L/h, mean maximum 
      concentration was 172.6μg/L, and mean terminal elimination half-life was 8.6 
      hours. Dialysis had no appreciable effect on rivaroxaban plasma concentrations. 
      Mean trough concentration after multiple daily doses of 10mg was 20.2μg/L. 
      LIMITATIONS: Higher rivaroxaban doses and patients with substantial residual 
      kidney function were not studied. CONCLUSIONS: A 10-mg dose of rivaroxaban in 
      hemodialysis patients without residual kidney function results in drug exposure 
      similar as published for 20mg in healthy volunteers. Rivaroxaban is not 
      eliminated by dialysis. There is no accumulation after multiple daily dosing. The 
      efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in hemodialysis patients should be the subject 
      of a large randomized trial.

TI  - Downregulation of ABCB1 gene in patients with total hip or knee arthroplasty 
      influences pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban: a population 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study.
PG  - 817-824
LID - 10.1007/s00228-019-02639-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Rivaroxaban is a substrate for ABCB1 transporter and is commonly used in 
      patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery for thromboprophylaxis. The 
      objective of this study was to develop a population 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model to investigate the influence of 
      ABCB1 gene expression and polymorphism on rivaroxaban exposure and 
      anticoagulation effects. METHODS: Five blood samples per patient were collected 
      during 5 days after the surgery for the determination of rivaroxaban 
      concentration in plasma and for determination of prothrombin time and partial 
      thromboplastin time. Non-linear mixed effects model was used for a population 
      PK-PD analysis and for testing covariate effects. RESULTS: A one-compartment PK 
      model with first-order absorption adequately described the pharmacokinetic data. 
      The typical oral clearance (CL/F) was 6.12 L/h (relative standard error, 15.8%) 
      and was associated with ABCB1 expression. Compared to base line before the 
      surgery, a significant ABCB1 downregulation was observed 5 days after the surgery 
      (p < 0.001). Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were both linearly 
      associated to the logarithm of the rivaroxaban plasma concentration. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We confirmed that variable rivaroxaban CL/F is associated with ABCB1 expression, 
      which is in accordance with previous studies on P-glycoprotein involvement in 
      rivaroxaban PK. Furthermore, we observed the downregulation of ABCB1 expression 
      after the surgery. The cause remains unclear and further research is needed to 
      explain the underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Effect of food, an antacid, and the H2 antagonist ranitidine on the absorption of 
      BAY 59-7939 (rivaroxaban), an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor, in healthy 
      subjects.
PG  - 549-58
AB  - To investigate the influence of food and administration of an antacid 
      (aluminum-magnesium hydroxide) or ranitidine on the absorption of BAY 59-7939 
      (rivaroxaban), 4 randomized studies were performed in healthy male subjects. In 2 
      food interaction studies, subjects received BAY 59-7939, either as two 5-mg 
      tablets (fasted and fed), four 5-mg tablets (fasted), or one 20-mg tablet (fasted 
      and fed). In 2 drug interaction studies, BAY 59-7939 (six 5-mg tablets) was given 
      alone or with ranitidine (150 mg twice daily, preceded by a 3-day pretreatment 
      phase) or antacid (10 mL). Plasma samples were obtained to assess pharmacokinetic 
      and pharmacodynamic parameters of BAY 59-7939. In the presence of food, time to 
      maximum concentration (t(max)) was delayed by 1.25 hours; maximum concentration 
      (C(max)) and area under the curve (AUC) were increased, with reduced 
      interindividual variability at higher doses of BAY 59-7939. Compared with 
      baseline, BAY 59-7939 resulted in a relative increase in maximum prothrombin time 
      (PT) prolongation of 44% (10 mg) and 53% (20 mg) in the fasted state, compared 
      with 53% and 83% after food. Time to maximum PT prolongation was delayed by 0.5 
      to 1.5 hours after food, with no relevant influence of food type. No significant 
      difference in C(max) and AUC was observed with coadministration of BAY 59-7939 
      and ranitidine or antacid.

TI  - Rivaroxaban for treatment of pediatric venous thromboembolism. An Einstein-Jr 
      phase 3 dose-exposure-response evaluation.
PG  - 1672-1685
LID - 10.1111/jth.14813 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, the randomized EINSTEIN-Jr study showed similar efficacy 
      and safety for rivaroxaban and standard anticoagulation for treatment of 
      pediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE). The rivaroxaban dosing strategy was 
      established based on phase 1 and 2 data in children and through pharmacokinetic 
      (PK) modeling. METHODS: Rivaroxaban treatment with tablets or the newly developed 
      granules-for-oral suspension formulation was bodyweight-adjusted and administered 
      once-daily, twice-daily, or thrice-daily for children with bodyweights of ≥30, 
      ≥12 to <30, and <12 kg, respectively. Previously, these regimens were confirmed 
      for children weighing ≥20 kg but only predicted in those <20 kg. Based on sparse 
      blood sampling, the daily area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      [AUC((0-24)ss) ] and trough [C(trough,ss) ] and maximum [C(max,ss) ] steady-state 
      plasma concentrations were derived using population PK modeling. 
      Exposure-response graphs were generated to evaluate the potential relationship of 
      individual PK parameters with recurrent VTE, repeat imaging outcomes, and 
      bleeding or adverse events. A taste-and-texture questionnaire was collected for 
      suspension-recipients. RESULTS: Of the 335 children (aged 0-17 years) allocated 
      to rivaroxaban, 316 (94.3%) were evaluable for PK analyses. Rivaroxaban exposures 
      were within the adult exposure range. No clustering was observed for any of the 
      PK parameters with efficacy, bleeding, or adverse event outcomes. Results were 
      similar for the tablet and suspension formulation. Acceptability and palatability 
      of the suspension were favorable. DISCUSSION: Based on this analysis and the 
      recently documented similar efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban compared with 
      standard anticoagulation, we conclude that bodyweight-adjusted pediatric 
      rivaroxaban regimens with either tablets or suspension are validated and provide 
      for appropriate treatment of children with VTE.

PG  - 675-86

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Rivaroxaban is an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor, 
      which is at an advanced stage of clinical development for prevention and 
      treatment of thromboembolic disorders. Two phase II studies, ODIXa-DVT and 
      EINSTEIN DVT, assessed the efficacy and safety of oral rivaroxaban (once daily or 
      twice daily) for treatment of acute deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). Population 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses of rivaroxaban in patients in these 
      two phase II studies were conducted to characterize the 
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban and the relationship between 
      important patient covariates and model parameters. Exposure simulations in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) were also performed in order to predict 
      the exposure of rivaroxaban, using modified demographic data reflecting the 
      characteristics of a typical AF population. METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic 
      model was developed using plasma samples from these patients. Various simulations 
      were conducted to explore the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in patients with 
      DVT and to predict exposure in those with AF. Correlations between plasma 
      rivaroxaban concentrations and the prothrombin time, Factor Xa activity, HepTest® 
      and activated partial thromboplastin time were also described. RESULTS: The 
      pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in patients with DVT were found to be consistent 
      and predictable across all doses studied. The area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) increased dose dependently. The same total daily 
      doses given once daily achieved higher maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) 
      values (∼20%) and lower trough (minimum) plasma concentration (C(trough)) values 
      (∼60%) than when given twice daily; however, the 5th-95th percentile ranges for 
      these parameters overlapped. Rivaroxaban clearance was moderately influenced by 
      age and renal function, and the volume of distribution was influenced by age, 
      body weight and sex; the effects were within the observed interindividual 
      variability. Simulations in virtual patient populations with AF showed that a 
      rivaroxaban dose of 15 mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance of 
      30-49 mL/min would achieve AUC and C(max) values similar to those observed with 
      20 mg once daily in patients with normal renal function. The prothrombin time 
      correlated almost linearly with plasma rivaroxaban concentrations (≤500 μg/L). 
      CONCLUSION: Population analyses of phase II clinical data indicated that the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of all rivaroxaban doses were predictable 
      and were affected by expected demographic factors in patients with acute DVT.

TI  - Safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of BAY 59-7939--an oral, direct 
      Factor Xa inhibitor--after multiple dosing in healthy male subjects.
PG  - 873-80
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is a clinical need for safe new oral anticoagulants. The 
      safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of BAY 59-7939--a 
      novel, oral, direct Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor--were investigated in this 
      single-center, placebo-controlled, single-blind, parallel-group, multiple-dose 
      escalation study. METHODS: Healthy male subjects (aged 20-45 years, body mass 
      index 18.6-31.4 kg/m(2)) received oral BAY 59-7939 (n=8 per dose regimen) or 
      placebo (n=4 per dose regimen) on days 0 and 3-7. Dosing regimens were 5 mg once, 
      twice (bid), or three times daily, and 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg bid. RESULTS: There 
      were no clinically relevant changes in bleeding time or other safety variables 
      across all doses and regimens. There was no dose-related increase in the 
      frequency or severity of adverse events with BAY 59-7939. Maximum inhibition of 
      FXa activity occurred after approximately 3 h, and inhibition was maintained for 
      at least 12 h for all doses. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin 
      time, and HepTest were prolonged to a similar extent to inhibition of FXa 
      activity for all doses. Dose-proportional pharmacokinetics (AUC(tau, norm) and 
      C(max, norm)) were observed at steady state (day 7). Maximum plasma 
      concentrations were achieved after 3-4 h. The terminal half-life of BAY 59-7939 
      was 5.7-9.2 h at steady state. There was no relevant accumulation at any dose. 
      CONCLUSIONS: BAY 59-7939 was safe and well tolerated across the wide dose range 
      studied, with predictable, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics and no relevant accumulation beyond steady state. These results 
      support further investigation of BAY 59-7939 in phase II clinical trials.

TI  - Simultaneous Determination of Rivaroxaban and Enalapril in Rat Plasma by 
      UPLC-MS/MS and Its Application to A Pharmacokinetic Interaction Study.
PG  - 229-236
LID - 10.1007/s13318-018-0504-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There have been no animal experiments and clinical 
      studies on the pharmacokinetic interaction between rivaroxaban and enalapril. To 
      investigate whether a potential pharmacokinetic interaction is present between 
      rivaroxaban and enalapril, a rapid and sensitive Ultra performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and 
      validated to determine the concentration of rivaroxaban and enalapril in rat 
      plasma and was then applied to a pharmacokinetic interaction study. METHODS: The 
      analytes were separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 chromatography column 
      (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) with acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase 
      with gradient elution. The mass spectrometer was operated in multiple reaction 
      monitoring mode to monitor the precursor-to-product ion transitions of 
      436.1 → 145.1 m/z for rivaroxaban, 377.3 → 234.2 m/z for enalapril and 
      285.2 → 193.1 m/z for diazepam (IS). RESULTS: The method was validated over the 
      concentration range of 1.0-200 ng/mL for rivaroxaban and 0.5-100 ng/mL for 
      enalapril. The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy of the quality control 
      (QC) samples exhibited relative standard deviations (RSD) < 9.4% and the accuracy 
      values ranged from - 8.3 to 9.6%. After co-administration of rivaroxaban and 
      enalapril, the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the systemic 
      drug concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC(0-∞)) of rivaroxaban 
      were significantly increased by 19.6% (p < 0.05) and 21.3% (p < 0.05), 
      respectively. On the contrary, the plasma clearance rate (CL/F) of rivaroxaban 
      and enalapril was significantly decreased by 17.8% (p < 0.05) and 23.8% 
      (p < 0.05), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The UPLC-MS/MS method was successfully 
      applied to simultaneous determination of rivaroxaban and enalapril in rat plasma 
      and applied to study the pharmacokinetic interaction between rivaroxaban and 
      enalapril. The co-administration of rivaroxaban and enalapril resulted in a 
      significant drug interaction in rats.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in children using physiologically based and 
      population pharmacokinetic modelling: an EINSTEIN-Jr phase I study.
PG  - 32

LID - 32
AB  - BACKGROUND: The EINSTEIN-Jr program will evaluate rivaroxaban for the treatment 
      of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children, targeting exposures similar to the 
      20 mg once-daily dose for adults. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) 
      model for pediatric rivaroxaban dosing has been constructed. METHODS: We 
      quantitatively assessed the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single rivaroxaban dose in 
      children using population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modelling and assessed the 
      applicability of the PBPK model. Plasma concentration-time data from the 
      EINSTEIN-Jr phase I study were analysed by non-compartmental and PopPK analyses 
      and compared with the predictions of the PBPK model. Two rivaroxaban dose levels, 
      equivalent to adult doses of rivaroxaban 10 mg and 20 mg, and two different 
      formulations (tablet and oral suspension) were tested in children aged 
      0.5-18 years who had completed treatment for VTE. RESULTS: PK data from 59 
      children were obtained. The observed plasma concentration-time profiles in all 
      subjects were mostly within the 90% prediction interval, irrespective of dose or 
      formulation. The PopPK estimates and non-compartmental analysis-derived PK 
      parameters (in children aged ≥6 years) were in good agreement with the PBPK model 
      predictions. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirmed the applicability of the 
      rivaroxaban pediatric PBPK model in the pediatric population aged 0.5-18 years, 
      which in combination with the PopPK model, will be further used to guide dose 
      selection for the treatment of VTE with rivaroxaban in EINSTEIN-Jr phase II and 
      III studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01145859;

AB  - Many patients with acute coronary syndrome receive chronic dual antiplatelet 
      therapy (acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel) for secondary event prophylaxis, 
      and new oral anticoagulants are being investigated as adjunctive therapy in this 
      indication. Gastrointestinal side effects such as bleeding are commonly 
      associated with antiplatelet use; accordingly, many patients receive proton pump 
      inhibitors (PPIs) to mitigate this. PPIs can reduce the antiplatelet activity of 
      clopidogrel through cytochrome P450 2C19 inhibition, and pantoprazole reduces the 
      bioavailability of dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor that acts via 
      cytochrome P450 2C19-independent mechanisms. These observations support the 
      investigation of potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions 
      between PPIs and anticoagulants. We evaluated the influence of administering 
      once-daily omeprazole 40 mg for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of a single 20-mg dose of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, 
      rivaroxaban, in a randomized, open-label, 2-way, crossover, drug-drug interaction 
      study in healthy subjects. No clinically meaningful interactions were observed; 
      geometric mean ratios were 101%, 101%, and 93.5% for rivaroxaban area under the 
      plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable 
      concentration (AUClast), or until infinity (AUC∞), and maximum plasma 
      concentration (Cmax), respectively. Prothrombin time increased similarly in both 
      treatment groups, with maximal values observed approximately 4 hours post 
      rivaroxaban administration. A single 20-mg rivaroxaban dose appears well 
      tolerated when administered alone or after 5 days of once-daily omeprazole 40 mg 
      administration.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of anticoagulants apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban

AB  - Steady-state plasma concentrations of anticoagulants and the time since the 
      previous administration in mainly outpatients with atrial fibrillation 
      administered standard or reduced doses were analyzed for 110 elderly Japanese 
      subjects (mean age, 76 years) treated with apixaban (2.5 or 5.0 mg twice daily), 
      dabigatran etexilate (110 or 150 mg twice daily), edoxaban (30 or 60 mg once 
      daily) or rivaroxaban (10 or 15 mg once daily) at one general hospital. The 
      pharmacokinetics in patients treated with standard and reduced doses of the four 
      anticoagulants using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was compared 
      with the concentration ranges estimated using physiologically based 
      pharmacokinetic modeling. Reduced doses of anticoagulants resulted in relatively 
      small pharmacokinetic variations compared with the standard dose. Statistical 
      analyses revealed that renal impairment is likely not the sole determinant factor 
      for high plasma concentrations of apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban. 
      Patients with atrial fibrillation should be treated with the correct doses of 
      oral anticoagulants as specified in the package inserts (e.g. reduced doses for 
      elderly patients, patients with low body weights and in combination with 
      P-glycoprotein inhibitor drugs) to avoid excessive or insufficient doses of 
      direct oral anticoagulants.

TI  - Integrated Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Rivaroxaban Across Multiple 
      Patient Populations.
PG  - 309-320
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12288 [doi]
AB  - The population pharmacokinetics (PK) of rivaroxaban have been evaluated in 
      several population-specific models. We developed an integrated population PK 
      model using pooled data from 4,918 patients in 7 clinical trials across all 
      approved indications. Effects of gender, age, and weight on apparent clearance 
      (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F), renal function, and 
      comedication on CL/F, and relative bioavailability as a function of dose (F) were 
      analyzed. Virtual subpopulations for exposure simulations were defined by age, 
      creatinine clearance (CrCL) and body mass index (BMI). Rivaroxaban PK were 
      adequately described by a one-compartment disposition model with a first-order 
      absorption rate constant. Significant effects of CrCL, use of comedications, and 
      study population on CL/F, age, weight, and gender on V/F, and dose on F were 
      identified. CrCL had a modest influence on exposure, whereas age and BMI had a 
      minor influence. The model was suitable to predict rivaroxaban exposure in 
      patient subgroups of special interest.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Modeling Analysis of GCC-4401C, a 
      Novel Direct Factor Xa Inhibitor, in Healthy Volunteers.
PG  - 532-543
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12103 [doi]
AB  - GCC-4401C, an orally active direct factor Xa inhibitor that is similar to 
      rivaroxaban, is currently under development for venous thromboembolic disease 
      (VTE). The purpose of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PKs) 
      and pharmacodynamics (PDs) of GCC-4401C by population modeling analysis and to 
      predict proper dosage regimens compared to rivaroxaban using data from two phase 
      I clinical studies. Plasma GCC-4401C concentrations over time were best described 
      by a two-compartment linear model and body weight was associated with central 
      volume of distribution. Relevant PD markers generally changed in a dose-dependent 
      manner and were described well with sigmoid, simple maximum effect, or linear 
      models. GCC-4401C was absorbed more rapidly than rivaroxaban. Comparisons based 
      on simulations of PD marker changes over time suggest that 20 mg and 40 mg of 
      GCC-4401C administered under fasted status are comparable to 10 mg and 20 mg of 
      rivaroxaban under fed status.

AB  - The purpose of the currents study was to enhance bioavailability of rivaroxaban 
      (RXB) and reduce the food effect. RXB loaded PLGA nanoparticles (RXB-PLGA-NPs) 
      were prepared by emulsion solvent evaporation method and optimized using central 
      composite design (CDD). The optimized RXB-PLGA-NPs (F8) with composition, PLGA 
      (125 mg), PVA (0.5%w/w) and RXB (20 mg) was found optimum with particle size 
      (496 ± 8.5 nm), PDI (0.607), ZP (- 18.41 ± 3.14 mV), %EE (87.9 ± 8.6) and %DL 
      (9.5 ± 1.6). The optimized NPs (F8) was further evaluated in vitro for DSC, FTIR, 
      SEM and in vitro release studies. A comparative pharmacokinetic studies with 
      commercial tablet (XARELTO®) were conducted on fasted and fed state rats. 
      Compared to commercial tablet (XARELTO®), the RXB-PLGA-NPs (F8) exhibited a 
      significant enhancement of bioavailability in both fasted and fed state. In 
      addition, the bioavailability of RXB from NPs (F8) was found unaffected in the 
      presence of food.

TI  - Effects of Carbamazepine and Phenytoin on Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
      of Rivaroxaban.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics12111040 [doi]
LID - 1040
AB  - Rivaroxaban (RIV) is commonly prescribed with carbamazepine or phenytoin 
      (CBZ/PHT) in post-stroke seizure or post-stroke epilepsy patients. Although 
      adverse events have been reported in several previous studies when they are 
      coadministered, there are no studies of the interactions between these drugs. 
      Therefore, our study was conducted to solve this lack of information. The 
      potential effects of CBZ/PHT were investigated by comparing the pharmacokinetic 
      (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of RIV between the control group (RIV 
      alone) and the test groups (RIV administered with CBZ/PHT) in rats using the 
      noncompartmental analysis (NCA) and the compartmental model approach. The NCA 
      results indicate that AUC(t) of RIV decreased by 57.9% or 89.7% and C(max) of RIV 
      decreased by 43.3% or 70.0% after administration of CBZ/PHT, respectively. In 
      addition, both CBZ and PHT generally reduced the effects of RIV on the 
      prothrombin times of the blood samples. PK profiles of RIV were most properly 
      described by a two-compartment disposition model with a mixed first- and 
      zero-order absorption kinetics and a first-order elimination kinetics. The 
      compartmental model approach showed that a 211% or 1030% increase in CL/F of RIV 
      and a 33.9% or 43.4% increase in D2 of RIV were observed in the test groups by 
      the effects of CBZ/PHT, respectively. In conclusion, CBZ and PHT significantly 
      reduced RIV exposure and therefore reduced the therapeutic effects of RIV. 
      Consequently, this might result in adverse events due to insufficient RIV 
      concentration to attain its therapeutic effects. Further studies are needed to 
      validate this finding.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Emergency Situations: Results 
      of the Prospective Observational RADOA-Registry.
PG  - 552-559

AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used worldwide. 
      Little is known so far about their pharmacokinetics in emergency situations. 
      METHODS: A prospective, observational registry was performed to determine the 
      clinical course in consecutive patients with major bleeding or urgent surgery 
      treated with DOACs. In samples collected as part of routine care DOAC drug 
      concentrations were measured using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem 
      mass spectrometry. Anticoagulant intensity at first presentation and drug 
      half-life (t (1/2)), tested in repeat samples, were evaluated. RESULTS: A total 
      of 140 patients were prospectively included. Pharmacokinetic data were available 
      in 94% (132/140) of patients. Note that 67% (89/132) experienced life-threatening 
      bleeding and 33% (43/132) needed an urgent surgery. For pharmacokinetic analysis 
      a total of 605 blood samples was available. Median concentration on admission was 
      205 ng/mL for rivaroxaban and 108 ng/mL for apixaban. All treatment groups showed 
      a high variation of drug concentrations at baseline. In rivaroxaban-treated 
      patients t (½) was 17.3 hours (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.4-19.7) without 
      significant difference in both groups (major bleeding: t (½) 16.7 hours, 95% CI: 
      14.7-19.3; urgent surgery: t (½) 19.7 hours, 95% CI: 15.2-27.9; p = 0.292). In 
      apixaban-treated patients t (½) was 25.0 hours (95% CI: 22.9-27.6) with a longer 
      t (½) after urgent surgery (t (1/2): 30.8 hours; 95% CI: 26.9-36.4) compared with 
      severe bleeding (t (1/2): 20.8 hours; 95% CI: 18.8-23.2; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      Emergency patients under DOAC treatment show a high variation of anticoagulant 
      concentrations at baseline. Compared with rivaroxaban, apixaban showed a lower 
      median concentration on admission and a longer t (½).

TI  - Interindividual variability in dabigatran and rivaroxaban exposure: contribution 
      of ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms and interaction with clarithromycin.
PG  - 273-283
LID - 10.1111/jth.13577 [doi]
AB  - Essentials Rivaroxaban and dabigatran are substrates of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
      encoded by the ABCB1 gene. We tested the effect of ABCB1 polymorphisms and of a 
      P-gp inhibitor on both drugs' pharmacokinetics. The ABCB1 genotype was not a 
      clinically relevant determinant of both drugs' pharmacokinetics. Administration 
      of P-gp inhibitors with dabigatran or rivaroxaban should be exercised with 
      caution. SUMMARY: Background The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) dabigatran 
      and rivaroxaban are both substrates of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter, 
      encoded by the ABCB1 gene. Rivaroxaban is metabolized by cytochrome P450 A4 
      (CYP3A4). Interindividual variability in DOAC exposure and frequent 
      P-gp-associated drug-drug interactions have been described in patients. Objective 
      To assess the influence of ABCB1 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of 
      dabigatran and rivaroxaban, associated or not with clarithromycin, a P-gp and 
      CYP3A4 inhibitor. Methods Sixty healthy male volunteers, selected according to 
      ABCB1 genotype (20 homozygous mutated, 20 heterozygous mutated, and 20 wild-type 
      for haplotype 2677-3435), were included in this randomized, two-center, crossover 
      study. All received sequentially a single dose of dabigatran etexilate (300 mg) 
      and rivaroxaban (40 mg) associated or not with clarithromycin. Peak plasma 
      concentration and area under the curve (AUC) were compared across the three ABCB1 
      genotypes. The effect of clarithromycin on dabigatran or rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics was assessed. Results Interindividual coefficients of variation 
      for AUC were 77% for dabigatran and 51% for rivaroxaban. ABCB1 genotype did not 
      significantly affect drug pharmacokinetics: AUC ratios between mutant-allele 
      carriers and wild-type volunteers were 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
      0.84-1.92) and 1.20 (95% CI 0.96-1.51) for dabigatran and rivaroxaban, 
      respectively. Clarithromycin coadministration led to a two-fold increase in both 
      drugs' AUC, irrespective of ABCB1 genotype: ratios of geometric means were 2.0 
      (95% CI 1.15-3.60) and 1.94 (95% CI 1.42-2.63) for dabigatran and rivaroxaban, 
      respectively. Conclusions ABCB1 genotype is not a significant determinant of 
      interindividual variability in dabigatran and rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics. The 
      levels of one drug did not predict the levels of the other. Coadministration of a 
      P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitor with dabigatran or rivaroxaban may warrant caution in 
      patients at risk of overexposure.

TI  - Preparation and Optimization of Rivaroxaban by Self-Nanoemulsifying Drug Delivery 
      System (SNEDDS) for Enhanced Oral Bioavailability and No Food Effect.
PG  - 1847-1859
LID - 10.1208/s12249-018-0991-6 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, a novel self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) was 
      used to improve the oral bioavailability in fasted state and diminish the food 
      effect for rivaroxaban. Oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant were selected by 
      saturated solubility study. IPM, Tween80, and 1,2-propanediol were finally 
      selected as oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant, respectively. The 
      pseudo-ternary-phase diagram was utilized to optimize the preliminary composition 
      of SNEDDS formulation. The optimized rivaroxaban-SNEDDS formulation was selected 
      by central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology. Optimized 
      SNEDDS formulation was evaluated for drug content, self-emulsifying time, droplet 
      size, zeta potential, polydispersity index, Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) 
      spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The drug dissolution 
      profile compared to the commercial formulation Xarelto® (20 mg rivaroxaban) was 
      determined in four different media (pH 1.2HCl, pH 4.5NaAc-HAc, pH 6.8PBS, and 
      water). The result indicated that the SNEDDS formulation had successfully 
      increased the drug solubility in four different media. A HPLC-MS method that 
      indicated a high sensitivity, strong attribute, and high accuracy characteristic 
      was built to measure the drug concentration in plasma. The fast/fed in vivo 
      pharmacokinetics studies of SNEDDS formulation and Xarelto® were carried out in 
      adult beagle dog, rivaroxaban with no food effect was achieved in SNEDDS 
      formulation compared with Xarelto® in fed state. The result suggested that SNEDDS

TI  - Perpetrator effects of ciclosporin (P-glycoprotein inhibitor) and its combination 
      with fluconazole (CYP3A inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in 
      healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1528-1537
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13934 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Rivaroxaban exposure is considerably increased by drugs that are combined 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitors (e.g. 
      ketoconazole). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the 
      potent P-gp inhibitor ciclosporin and its combination with the moderate CYP3A 
      inhibitor fluconazole on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and on CYP3A activity. 
      METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers received 20 mg rivaroxaban orally alone, in 
      combination with ciclosporin (dose-individualized oral regimen), and in 
      combination with ciclosporin and fluconazole (400 mg day(-1) orally). CYP3A4 
      activity was estimated using a midazolam microdose. Pharmacokinetics was analysed 
      using noncompartmental and compartmental methods. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, 
      ciclosporin increased rivaroxaban average exposure by 47% (90% confidence 
      interval 28-68%), maximum concentration by 104% (70-146%), and decreased CYP3A4 
      activity by 34% (25-42%). Ciclosporin combined with fluconazole increased 
      rivaroxaban average exposure by 86% (58-119%) and maximum concentration by 115% 
      (83-153%), which was considerably stronger than observed in historical controls 
      receiving rivaroxaban with fluconazole alone, and decreased CYP3A4 activity by 
      79% (76-82%). CONCLUSION: Patients treated with rivaroxaban in combination with 
      single modulators of multiple elimination pathways or multiple modulators of 
      single elimination pathways (CYP3A, P-gp) require particular care.

TI  - Effect of Activated Charcoal on Rivaroxaban Complex Absorption.
PG  - 793-801
LID - 10.1007/s40262-016-0485-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of activated charcoal (AC) on rivaroxaban 
      exposure in healthy volunteers. METHODS: This was an open-label study with an 
      incomplete cross-over design of single-dose rivaroxaban (40 mg) administered 
      alone or with AC in 12 healthy volunteers. The study comprised three treatment 
      periods in randomised sequence, one with rivaroxaban administered alone and two 
      with AC given at 2, 5 or 8 h post-dose. Rivaroxaban plasma concentration was 
      measured in blood samples drawn at 16 time points. The pharmacokinetic model of 
      rivaroxaban alone or with AC administration was built using a non-linear 
      mixed-effect modelling approach. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic model was based on 
      a one-compartment model with an absorption rate described by the sum of three 
      inverse Gaussian densities to reproduce multiphasic and prolonged absorption. The 
      inclusion in the model of each AC administration schedule significantly improved 
      objective function value. AC reduced the area under the rivaroxaban 
      concentration-time curve by 43% when administered 2 h post-dose, by 31% when 
      administered 5 h post-dose and by 29% when administered 8 h post-dose. Based on 
      the estimated pharmacokinetic model, simulations suggested that AC might have an 
      impact even after 8 h post-dose. CONCLUSION: AC administration significantly 
      reduces exposure to rivaroxaban even if AC is administered 8 h after rivaroxaban. 
      These results suggest that AC could be used in rivaroxaban overdose and 
      accidental ingestion to antagonise absorption. CLINICALTRIAL. GOV REGISTRATION

TI  - Dissociation between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of once-daily 
      rivaroxaban and twice-daily apixaban: a randomized crossover study.
PG  - 2017-2028
LID - 10.1111/jth.13801 [doi]
AB  - Essentials In this crossover study the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban were compared. Healthy volunteers received rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily 
      or apixaban 5 mg twice daily. Rivaroxaban was associated with more prolonged 
      inhibition of thrombin generation than apixaban. Rivaroxaban induced a clear 
      prolongation of prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. 
      SUMMARY: Background The anticoagulant actions of the oral direct activated 
      factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, have not previously been directly 
      compared. Objectives To compare directly the steady-state pharmacokinetics and 
      anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban at doses approved for stroke 
      prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Methods Twenty-four 
      healthy Caucasian male volunteers were included in this open-label, two-period 
      crossover, phase 1 study (EudraCT number: 2015-002612-32). Volunteers were 
      randomized to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily or apixaban 5 mg twice daily 
      for 7 days, followed by a washout period of at least 7 days before they received 
      the other treatment. Plasma concentrations and anticoagulant effects were 
      measured at steady state and after drug discontinuation. Results Overall exposure 
      was similar for both drugs: the geometric mean area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve for the 0-24-h interval was 1830 μg h L(-1) for 
      rivaroxaban and 1860 μg h L(-1) for apixaban. Rivaroxaban was associated with 
      greater inhibition of endogenous thrombin potential (geometric mean area under 
      the curve relative to baseline during the 0-24-h interval: 15.5 h versus 17.5 h) 
      and a more pronounced maximal prolongation relative to baseline of prothrombin 
      time (PT) (1.66-fold versus 1.14-fold) and activated partial thromboplastin time 
      (APTT) (1.43-fold versus 1.16-fold) at steady state than apixaban. Conclusions 
      Despite similar exposure to both drugs, rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was 
      associated with greater and more sustained inhibition of thrombin generation than 
      apixaban 5 mg twice daily. Sensitive PT and APTT assays can be used to estimate 
      the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban.

AB  - WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: • Population pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban have been characterized in healthy subjects and 
      in patients with total venous thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis or atrial 
      fibrillation. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: • This article is the first description of 
      the population pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of rivaroxaban in 
      patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It is the largest population 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study on rivaroxaban conducted to date (n= 
      2290). The PK and PK-PD relationship of rivaroxaban in patients with ACS were 
      similar to those in other patient populations. In addition, model-based 
      simulations showed that the influence of renal function and age on the exposure 
      to rivaroxaban in the ACS population were similar to the findings from Phase 1 
      special population studies. These findings suggest that rivaroxaban has highly 
      predictable PK-PD and may provide a consistent anticoagulant effect across the 
      studied patient populations, which allows an accurate prediction of the dose to 
      control anticoagulation optimally. AIMS: The aim of this analysis was to use a 
      population approach to facilitate the understanding of the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) 
      and to evaluate the influence of patient covariates on the exposure of 
      rivaroxaban in patients with ACS. METHODS A population pharmacokinetic model was 
      developed using pharmacokinetic samples from 2290 patients in Anti-Xa Therapy to 
      Lower Cardiovascular Events in Addition to Standard Therapy in Subjects with 
      Acute Coronary Syndrome Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 46. The 
      relationship between pharmacokinetics and the primary pharmacodynamic end point, 
      prothrombin time, was evaluated. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in 
      patients with ACS was adequately described by an oral one-compartment model. The 
      estimated absorption rate, apparent clearance and volume of distribution were 
      1.24 h(-1) (interindividual variability, 139%), 6.48 l h(-1) (31%) and 57.9 l 
      (10%), respectively. Simulations indicate that the influences of renal function, 
      age and bodyweight on exposure in ACS patients are consistent with the findings 
      in previous Phase 1 studies. Rivaroxaban plasma concentrations exhibit a 
      close-to-linear relationship with prothrombin time in the ACS population, with 
      little interindividual variability. The estimated pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic parameters for the ACS patients were comparable to those for 
      venous thromboembolism prevention, deep vein thrombosis and atrial fibrillation 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: The similarity in pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of 
      rivaroxaban among different patient populations and the low interindividual 
      variability in the exposure-prothrombin time relationship indicate that the 
      anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is highly predictable and consistent across 
      all the patient populations studied.

LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2010.08.027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is associated with a hypercoagulable state that 
      predisposes to thromboembolism and anti-coagulation may improve clinical 
      outcomes. The oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, has not been studied 
      in patients with HF. We hypothesized that rivaroxaban would also reduce 
      biomarkers of hypercoagulability in patients with HF. METHODS: This study 
      consisted of two cohorts: Cohort 1, open-label, actively controlled with 
      enoxaparin 40 mg once daily, included 8 patients with acute decompensated HF; 
      Cohort 2, double-blind and placebo-controlled, included 18 patients with stable, 
      severe New York Heart Association Class III/IV HF. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of rivaroxaban were similar across both cohorts. 
      Biomarker assessments were performed in Cohort 2; prothrombin fragment 1.2 (F1.2) 
      mean concentration decreased by 2.7 ng/ml over 7 days with rivaroxaban, and 
      increased by 11.6 ng/ml with placebo, an absolute difference of 14.3 ng/ml (p = 
      0.0009). A non-significant reduction in rate of increase of D-dimer (DD) and 
      thrombin-anti-thrombin complex (TAT) levels with rivaroxaban was observed over 7 
      days (p = 0.31 and p = 0.77, respectively). CONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban has similar 
      PK/PD in patients with either acute or chronic HF. In vivo, hypercoagulability 
      biomarkers appear to increase over time. Rivaroxaban reversed this trend for 
      F1.2, and may reduce the rate of increase of DD and TAT in patients with stable, 
      severe HF.

TI  - Chitosan caged liposomes for improving oral bioavailability of rivaroxaban: 
      in vitro and in vivo evaluation.
PG  - 316-327
LID - 10.1080/10837450.2020.1870237 [doi]
AB  - In this study, chitosan (CS) caged classic liposomes (CLs) and flexible liposomes 
      (FLs) were developed to enhance the oral bioavailability of rivaroxaban (RVX) in 
      the fasted condition. The prepared formulations were subjected to physicochemical 
      characterization included: FTIR, DSC, zeta potential, particle size, 
      polydispersity index, entrapment efficiency, in vitro dissolution, and 
      transmission electron microscope imaging. The selected formulation (RVX-TFL2) 
      composed of PL S100/Tween 80 (85/15% w/w) and coated with CS solution in the 
      strength of (0.2% w/v) had a particle size of 105.67 nm, a zeta potential of 
      +5.67 mV and EE of 96.07%. Compared to RXV suspension, the pharmacokinetic 
      parameters (C (max), AUC(0-24), and AUC(0-∞)) of RVX-TFL2 showed no statistically 
      significant difference (P > 0.05) in the fasted and fed test animals. Besides, 
      RVX bioavailability with RVX-TFL2 was improved by 59.66% and 26.97% in the fed 
      and fasted states, respectively, compared to RVX suspension in the fed state. The 
      result highlighted the efficacy of the prepared liquid formulation comprising CS 
      coated liposomes in improving the oral bioavailability of RVX regardless of the 
      fed state. Moreover, the studied liquid formulation could be utilized in 
      developing a liquid dosage form that might be useful as a pediatric formulation 
      of RVX.

TI  - Development of a paediatric population-based model of the pharmacokinetics of 
      rivaroxaban.
PG  - 89-102
LID - 10.1007/s40262-013-0090-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism has been increasingly recognised as a clinical 
      problem in the paediatric population. Guideline recommendations for 
      antithrombotic therapy in paediatric patients are based mainly on extrapolation 
      from adult clinical trial data, owing to the limited number of clinical trials in 
      paediatric populations. The oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban has been 
      approved in adult patients for several thromboembolic disorders, and its 
      well-defined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics and efficacy and 
      safety profiles in adults warrant further investigation of this agent in the 
      paediatric population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop and 
      qualify a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for rivaroxaban 
      doses of 10 and 20 mg in adults and to scale this model to the paediatric 
      population (0-18 years) to inform the dosing regimen for a clinical study of 
      rivaroxaban in paediatric patients. METHODS: Experimental data sets from phase I 
      studies supported the development and qualification of an adult PBPK model. This 
      adult PBPK model was then scaled to the paediatric population by including 
      anthropometric and physiological information, age-dependent clearance and 
      age-dependent protein binding. The pharmacokinetic properties of rivaroxaban in 
      virtual populations of children were simulated for two body weight-related dosing 
      regimens equivalent to 10 and 20 mg once daily in adults. The quality of the 
      model was judged by means of a visual predictive check. Subsequently, paediatric 
      simulations of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), maximum 
      (peak) plasma drug concentration (C max) and concentration in plasma after 24 h 
      (C 24h) were compared with the adult reference simulations. RESULTS: Simulations 
      for AUC, C max and C 24h throughout the investigated age range largely overlapped 
      with values obtained for the corresponding dose in the adult reference simulation 
      for both body weight-related dosing regimens. However, pharmacokinetic values in 
      infants and preschool children (body weight <40 kg) were lower than the 90 % 
      confidence interval threshold of the adult reference model and, therefore, 
      indicated that doses in these groups may need to be increased to achieve the same 
      plasma levels as in adults. For children with body weight between 40 and 70 kg, 
      simulated plasma pharmacokinetic parameters (C max, C 24h and AUC) overlapped 
      with the values obtained in the corresponding adult reference simulation, 
      indicating that body weight-related exposure was similar between these children 
      and adults. In adolescents of >70 kg body weight, the simulated 90 % prediction 
      interval values of AUC and C 24h were much higher than the 90 % confidence 
      interval of the adult reference population, owing to the weight-based simulation 
      approach, but for these patients rivaroxaban would be administered at adult fixed 
      doses of 10 and 20 mg. CONCLUSION: The paediatric PBPK model developed here 
      allowed an exploratory analysis of the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in 
      children to inform the dosing regimen for a clinical study in paediatric 
      patients.

TI  - Sustained safe and effective anticoagulation using Edoxaban via percutaneous 
      endoscopic gastrostomy.
PG  - 884-888
LID - 10.1002/ehf2.12434 [doi]
AB  - Extensive data support the safety of direct oral anticoagulants compared with 
      vitamin K antagonists in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, leading 
      to a significantly increase in the use of these compounds in clinical practice. 
      However, there is no compelling evidence supporting the use of direct oral 
      anticoagulant in individuals who are intubated or have a percutaneous endoscopic 
      gastrostomy (PEG): patients with several co-morbidities are underrepresented in 
      clinical trials, so the best long-term strategy for anticoagulation is difficult 
      to ascertain. The aim of the present report was to evaluate the safety and 
      efficacy of edoxaban administered via PEG in a patient with heart failure and a 
      history of atrial fibrillation affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A 
      71-year-old man with atrial fibrillation, advanced ALS, type II diabetes 
      mellitus, and hypertension presented to the emergency department with dyspnoea 
      and tachycardia. Because vitamin K antagonist and rivaroxaban 15 mg were dropped 
      because of difficult international normalized ratio control (time in therapeutic 
      range <30%) and severe haematuria, respectively, edoxaban 30 mg (crushed pill) 
      daily was administered based on the patient's weight of 58 kg. Mean edoxaban 
      plasma concentration-time profiles were measured, as anti-Xa activity, 2 h before 
      and at 2, 6, and 22 h after drug administration and then compared with the 
      pharmacokinetic profile of edoxaban 30 mg in healthy subjects. An additional 
      testing of steady-state peak plasma concentration of edoxaban after 10 days and a 
      30 day follow-up were evaluated. The values of the pharmacokinetic parameters, 
      analysed with a non-compartmental analysis by PKSolver module, showed that C(max) 
      and AUC(0→t) were only slightly higher than those observed in healthy subjects, 
      while the half-life and observed clearance were significantly longer and lower, 
      respectively, than in normal subjects. Steady-state peak plasma concentration of 
      edoxaban was very similar to the levels reported in healthy subjects, and neither 
      relevant bleeding nor thromboembolic event was reported at a 30 day follow-up. 
      These results support safe and effective anticoagulation with edoxaban 30 mg but 
      suggest caution with the use of full dose of edoxaban (60 mg daily) in this kind 
      of patients. We report, for the first time, a safe and effective anticoagulation 
      based on the administration of edoxaban 30 mg daily through PEG in a patient with 
      advanced ALS, acute respiratory, and heart failure, presenting with Takotsubo 
      syndrome and atrial fibrillation.

TI  - Impaired Rivaroxaban Clearance in Mild Renal Insufficiency With Verapamil 
      Coadministration: Potential Implications for Bleeding Risk and Dose Selection.
PG  - 533-540
LID - 10.1002/jcph.1040 [doi]
AB  - Pharmacokinetics and antithrombotic effects of the Factor Xa inhibitor 
      rivaroxaban were studied in subjects with mild renal insufficiency concurrently 
      taking the P-glycoprotein and moderate CYP3A inhibitor verapamil, a drug commonly 
      administered to patients with hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or atrial 
      fibrillation. Age-matched controls with normal renal function were studied 
      concurrently. Subjects' overall mean age was 59 years. Mean creatinine clearance 
      values in the 2 groups were 105 and 71 mL/min. After single 20-mg oral doses, 
      rivaroxaban area under the curve (AUC) was increased by a factor of 1.11 (ratio 
      of geometric means [RGM]) in mild renal insufficiency compared to controls. 
      Verapamil coadministration independently increased AUC to the same extent in both 
      the mild renal insufficiency and control groups (RGM, 1.39 and 1.43). Concurrent 
      mild renal insufficiency and verapamil produced additive inhibition compared to 
      controls without verapamil (RGM, 1.58). Prothrombin time (PT) prolongation and 
      Factor Xa inhibition tracked plasma rivaroxaban, and were enhanced by verapamil. 
      Concentration-response relationships for PT (linear) and Factor Xa inhibition 
      (hyperbolic) were unaffected by renal function or verapamil. The absolute and 
      relative increases in rivaroxaban AUC caused by verapamil in mild renal 
      insufficiency subjects are potentially associated with an increased bleeding 
      risk. Modification of recommended dosage may be required in this combination of 
      circumstances to reduce risk to patients.

TI  - Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for determination of 
      rivaroxaban in human plasma and its application to a pharmacokinetic study.
PG  - 91-105
LID - 10.1177/1469066719875014 [doi]
AB  - A high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric method for the 
      determination of Rivaroxaban in human plasma has been developed and validated 
      using Rivaroxaban D(4) as an internal standard. The extraction of analyte and 
      internal standard was accomplished by solid phase extraction technique. The 
      method has been validated over a concentration range of 5.96-801 ng/mL. 
      Chromatographic separations were achieved using Gemini C18, 150 mm × 4.6 mm, 
      5 µm, column eluted at flow rate of 1.5 mL/min with mobile phase (acetonitrile: 
      ammonium acetate buffer (80:20 v/v)). The overall run time of method was about 
      1.8 min with elution times of Rivaroxaban and its internal standard Rivaroxaban 
      D(4) at around 1.18 min. The multiple reaction monitoring transitions were set at 
      436/145 (m/z) and 440/145 (m/z) for Rivaroxaban and Rivaroxaban D(4), 
      respectively. The calibration curves were linear (r(2 )≥ 0.99) over the range of 
      5.96-801 ng/mL with lower limit of quantitation validated at 5.96 ng/mL. 
      Extraction recoveries were >88% for both rivaroxaban and its stable labeled 
      internal standard rivaroxaban D(4). The inter-day/between run precisions were 
      ranged from 1.08% to 3.75%, while accuracy ranged from 96.3% to 102%. The 
      presented method was used in pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers. Results 
      of incurred sample reanalysis were within the acceptance range of ±20% of 
      original value, for 98.3% of samples reanalyzed. This indicated good assay 
      precision of target analytes in their real matrix at the employed experimental 
      conditions. The applicability of the assay for the determination of the 
      pharmacokinetic parameters was demonstrated.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban--an oral, direct 
      factor Xa inhibitor--in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.
PG  - 203-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a clinical need for novel oral anticoagulants with 
      predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Rivaroxaban is an oral direct 
      Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor in clinical development for the prevention and 
      treatment of thromboembolic disorders. This analysis was performed to 
      characterize the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban 
      in patients participating in two phase II, double-blind, randomized, 
      active-comparator-controlled studies of twice-daily rivaroxaban for the 
      prevention of venous thromboembolism after total hip- or knee-replacement 
      surgery. METHODS: Sparse blood samples were taken from all patients participating 
      in the studies (n = 1009). In addition, a subset of patients in the hip study (n 
      = 36) underwent full profiling. Rivaroxaban plasma concentrations, FXa activity 
      and the prothrombin time were determined. Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling was 
      used to model the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      rivaroxaban. RESULTS: An oral one-compartment model described the population 
      pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban well. On the first postoperative day only, 
      categorization of patients as slow or fast absorbers as a tool to address 
      variability in absorption improved the fit of the model. Clearance of rivaroxaban 
      was lower and more variable on the first postoperative day, and so time was 
      factored into the model. Overall, the only major difference between the models 
      for the hip study and the knee study was that clearance was 26% lower in the knee 
      study, resulting in approximately 30% higher exposure. Residual variability in 
      the models was moderate (37% and 34% in the hip and knee studies, respectively). 
      Plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban increased dose dependently. Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters that were estimated using the models agreed closely with results from 
      full-profile patients in the hip study, demonstrating that rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics are predictable. The pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban were 
      affected by expected covariates: age affected clearance in the hip study only, 
      haematocrit (on the first postoperative day only) and gender affected clearance 
      in the knee study only, and renal function affected clearance in both studies. 
      Bodyweight affected the volume of distribution in both studies. However, the 
      effects of covariates on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban were generally 
      small, and predictions of 'extreme' case scenarios suggested that fixed dosing of 
      rivaroxaban was likely to be possible. FXa activity and the prothrombin time were 
      both affected by surgery, probably because of perioperative bleeding and 
      intravenous administration of fluids; therefore, time was included in the 
      pharmacodynamic models. In both studies, FXa activity correlated with rivaroxaban 
      plasma concentrations following a maximum effect model, whereas prothrombin time 
      prolongation correlated following a linear model with intercept. The slope of the 
      prothrombin time prolongation correlation was 3.2 seconds/(100 microg/L) in the 
      hip study and 4.2 seconds/(100 microg/L) in the knee study. Both pharmacodynamic 
      models in both studies demonstrated low residual variability of approximately 
      10%. CONCLUSION: This population analysis in patients undergoing major 
      orthopaedic surgery demonstrated that rivaroxaban has predictable, dose-dependent 
      pharmacokinetics that were well described by an oral one-compartment model and 
      affected by expected covariates. Rivaroxaban exposure could be assessed using the 
      prothrombin time, if necessary, but not the international normalized ratio. The 
      findings suggested that fixed dosing of rivaroxaban may be possible in patients 
      undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The anticoagulant actions of oral direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors 
      can be inferred from their observed plasma concentrations; however, the 
      steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of different FXa inhibitors have not been 
      compared in clinically. METHODS: The sensitivity of the rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      and edoxaban in the STA-Liquid Anti-FXa assay were compared, and the anti-FXa 
      plasma concentrations were measured for PK assessments. Nonlinear mixed-effects 
      modeling was used to assess population PK in 329 patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation or venous thromboembolism. Patients were followed up for an average 
      of 3.6 years. RESULTS: Sensitivity was similar among the three drugs in this 
      assay, which could directly compare plasma concentrations instead of anti-FXa 
      activities. Overall exposure was greatest in 5 mg BID apixaban relative to other 
      drugs (p < 0.001). The geometric mean AUC for the 0 to 24-h interval was 
      4550 ng h/mL for apixaban, 2710 ng h/mL for 15 mg QD rivaroxaban, and 
      1290 ng h/mL for 60 mg QD edoxaban. The PKs of 2.5 mg BID apixaban or 15 mg QD 
      rivaroxaban were associated with hemorrhagic events. CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban was 
      associated with greater exposure, higher trough concentrations in plasma compared 
      with rivaroxaban or edoxaban. Furthermore, a higher plasma concentration may 
      partially predict hemorrhagic events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is concern amongst clinicians that the fixed dosing strategy of 
      rivaroxaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) might not be 
      optimal in those patients under or overweight. OBJECTIVE: To develop a 
      pharmacokinetic model for rivaroxaban, based on real-world patients, specifically 
      focusing on the impact of patients' body weight on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics. 
      PATIENTS/METHODS: One hundred and one patients prescribed rivaroxaban 
      prophylactic or treatment doses for the prevention or treatment of VTE were 
      recruited at a London teaching hospital. Subjects had up to 3 rivaroxaban 
      concentrations measured during a single dosing period (trough, 1 and 3 hours post 
      dose). Population pharmacokinetic analyses was conducted to develop a rivaroxaban 
      model, which was subsequently evaluated. RESULTS: A one-compartment model with 
      between-subject variability on rivaroxaban clearance and volume of distribution, 
      with a combined (additive and proportional) error model, best fitted the data. 
      Following a full covariate analysis, creatinine clearance on rivaroxaban 
      clearance was found to be the significant covariate impacting on the 
      pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban in the dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      suggest that the most important covariate impacting on rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics is creatinine clearance and the weight alone has little effect. 
      These findings are in line with previous studies for rivaroxaban. Larger 
      datasets, from real-world patients who are followed longitudinally, should be 
      conducted to provide front-line clinicians with further reassurance when 
      prescribing rivaroxaban for the acute management of VTE.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in patients with 
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation: results from ROCKET AF.
PG  - 917-27
LID - 10.1002/jcph.288 [doi]
AB  - Two once-daily rivaroxaban dosing regimens were compared with warfarin for stroke 
      prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in ROCKET AF: 20 mg 
      for patients with normal/mildly impaired renal function and 15 mg for patients 
      with moderate renal impairment. Rivaroxaban population pharmacokinetic 
      (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling data from ROCKET AF patients (n = 161) are 
      reported and are used to confirm established rivaroxaban PK and PK/PD models and 
      to re-estimate values of the models' parameters for the current AF population. An 
      oral one-compartment model with first-order absorption adequately described 
      rivaroxaban PK. Age, renal function, and lean body mass influenced the PK model. 
      Prothrombin time and prothrombinase-induced clotting time exhibited a near-linear 
      relationship with rivaroxaban plasma concentration; inhibitory effects were 
      observed through to 24 hours post-dose. Rivaroxaban plasma concentration and 
      factor Xa activity had an inhibitory maximum-effect (Emax ) relationship. Renal 
      function (on prothrombin time; prothrombinase-induced clotting time) and age (on 
      factor Xa activity) had moderate effects on PK/PD models. PK and PK/PD models 
      were shown to be adequate for describing the current dataset. These findings 
      confirm the modeling and empirical results that led to the selection of doses 
      tested against warfarin in ROCKET AF.

PG  - 2269-2281
LID - 10.4155/bio-2019-0230 [doi]
AB  - Aim: A reliable, sensitive and simple LC-MS/MS method has been established and 
      validated for the quantitation of rivaroxaban (RIV) and metformin (MET) in rat 
      plasma. Results: The procedure of method validation was conducted according to 
      the guiding principles of EMA and US FDA. At the same time, the method was 
      applied to pharmacokinetic interactions study between RIV and MET for the first 
      time. When RIV and MET coadministered to rats, pharmacokinetic parameters of MET 
      like AUC((0-t)), AUC((0-∞)) and C(max) had statistically significant increased. 
      t(max) of RIV was prolonged without affecting t(1/2) obviously and C(max) was 
      inhibited significantly (p < 0.05) by comparison to the single group. Conclusion: 
      The results indicated that drug-drug interactions occurred when the 
      coadministration of RIV and MET.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of rivaroxaban.
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1007/s40262-013-0100-7 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor that targets free and 
      clot-bound Factor Xa and Factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex. It is absorbed 
      rapidly, with maximum plasma concentrations being reached 2-4 h after tablet 
      intake. Oral bioavailability is high (80-100 %) for the 10 mg tablet irrespective 
      of food intake and for the 15 mg and 20 mg tablets when taken with food. 
      Variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters is moderate (coefficient of 
      variation 30-40 %). The pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban is consistent in 
      healthy subjects and across a broad range of different patient populations 
      studied. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with a terminal half-life 
      of 5-9 h in healthy young subjects and 11-13 h in elderly subjects. Rivaroxaban 
      produces a pharmacodynamic effect that is closely correlated with its plasma 
      concentration. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship for 
      inhibition of Factor Xa activity can be described by an E max model, and 
      prothrombin time prolongation by a linear model. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit 
      cytochrome P450 enzymes or known drug transporter systems and, because 
      rivaroxaban has multiple elimination pathways, it has no clinically relevant 
      interactions with most commonly prescribed medications. Rivaroxaban has been 
      approved for clinical use in several thromboembolic disorders.

      Application to pharmacokinetic studies.
PG  - e5147
LID - 10.1002/bmc.5147 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant (orally active direct Xa inhibitor) considered to 
      reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism and treat deep vein thrombosis, 
      pulmonary embolism, and other cardiovascular complications. Bioanalytical methods 
      for rivaroxaban quantification in plasma are necessary for application in 
      pharmacokinetic studies, as well as in drug therapeutic monitoring. In this work, 
      we developed and validated a sensitive bioanalytical method using LC-MS/MS for 
      rivaroxaban quantification in human plasma using an one-step liquid-liquid 
      extraction. The linear concentration range was 1-600 ng/mL. The bioanalytical 
      method was also applied to pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers under 
      fasting and fed conditions. The results demonstrated that the method is rapid, 
      sensitive, and adequate for application in pharmacokinetic studies.

AB  - Concomitant use of rivaroxaban with non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers 
      (non-DHPs) might lead to an increase of systemic rivaroxaban exposure and 
      anticoagulant effects in relation to the inhibition of metabolic enzymes and/or 
      transporters by non-DHPs. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of 
      verapamil and diltiazem on the pharmacokinetics and the prolongation of 
      prothrombin time of rivaroxaban in rats. The data were analyzed using a 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) modeling approach to quantify the 
      influence of verapamil. Verapamil increased the systemic exposure of rivaroxaban 
      by 2.8-fold (p <0.001) which was probably due to the inhibition of efflux 
      transportation rather than metabolism. Prothrombin time was also prolonged in a 
      proportional manner; diltiazem did not show any significant effects, however. A 
      transit PK model in the absorption process comprehensively describes the 
      double-peaks of rivaroxaban plasma concentrations and the corresponding change of 
      prothrombin time with a simple linear relationship. The slope of prothrombin time 
      vs. rivaroxaban plasma concentration in rats was retrospectively found to be 
      insensitive by about 5.4-fold compared to than in humans. More than a 67% dose 
      reduction in rivaroxaban is suggested in terms of both a pharmacokinetic point of 
      view, and the sensitivity differences on the prolongation of prothrombin time 
      when used concomitantly with verapamil.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging safety and efficacy data for rivaroxaban suggest traditional 
      therapy and rivaroxaban are comparable in the morbidly obese. However, real-world 
      data that indicate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters are comparable at the extremes 
      of body size are lacking. The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis 
      Scientific and Standardisation Committee (ISTH SSC) suggests avoiding the use of 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients weighing >120 kg or with a body 
      mass index >40 kg/m(2) and gives no recommendation on the use of DOACs in those 
      <50 kg. OBJECTIVES: To generate a population PK model to understand the influence 
      of bodyweight on rivaroxaban exposure from clinical practice data. METHOD: 
      Rivaroxaban plasma concentrations and patient characteristics were collated 
      between 2013 and 2018 at King's College Hospital anticoagulation clinic. A 
      population PK model was developed using a nonlinear mixed effects approach and 
      then used to simulate rivaroxaban concentrations at the extremes of bodyweight. 
      RESULTS: A robust population PK model derived from 913 patients weighing between 
      39 kg and 172 kg was developed. The model included data from n = 86 >120 kg, 
      n = 74 BMI >40 kg/m(2) , and n = 30 <50 kg. A one-compartment model with 
      between-subject variability on clearance and a proportional error model best 
      described the data. Creatinine clearance calculated by Cockcroft-Gault, with lean 
      bodyweight as the weight descriptor in this equation, was the most significant 
      covariate influencing rivaroxaban exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our work demonstrates 
      rivaroxaban can be used at extremes of bodyweight provided renal function is 
      satisfactory. We recommend that the ISTH SSC revises the current guidance with 
      respect to rivaroxaban at extremes of body size.

TI  - Assessment of Dose Proportionality of Rivaroxaban Nanocrystals.
PG  - 228
LID - 10.1208/s12249-020-01776-z [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban (RXB) is a class II drug, according to the Biopharmaceutics 
      Classification System. Since its bioavailability is low at high doses, dose 
      proportionality is not achieved for pharmacokinetic parameters. However, when 
      taken with food, its bioavailability increases at high doses. In this study, 
      nanocrystal technology was used to increase the solubility and, hence, the 
      bioavailability of RXB. Pluronic F127, pharmacoat 603, and PVP K-30 were used as 
      stabilizers to prepare RXB nanosuspension, combining ball mill and high pressure 
      homogenization methods. Particle sizes of RXB in nanosuspension (formulation 
      A:348 nm; formulation B:403 nm) and nanocrystal formulations (formulation 
      A:1167 nm; formulation B:606 nm) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) compared 
      to those of bulk RXB. In both formulations, 80% of the drug dissolved in 30 min. 
      For dose proportionality evaluation, 3, 10, and 15 mg/kg of RXB nanosuspensions 
      (formulation B) were administered to rabbits. The dose proportionality for AUC 
      and C(max) of RXB nanocrystals was assessed by the power model, variance analysis 
      of pharmacokinetic parameters, linear regression, and equivalence criterion 
      methods. Dose proportionality for AUC was achieved at doses between 10-15 and 
      3-15 mg/kg. In conclusion, the preparation of a nanocrystal formulation of RXB 
      improved its dissolution rate and pharmacokinetic profile.

TI  - Effect of co-administration of rivaroxaban and clopidogrel on bleeding time, 
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics: a phase I study.
PG  - 279-96
LID - 10.3390/ph5030279 [doi]
AB  - Dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and a thienopyridine, such as 
      clopidogrel, is effective for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events 
      in patients with acute coronary syndrome, but there is still a substantial 
      residual risk of recurrence. Although anticoagulant therapy with a vitamin K 
      antagonist (e.g. warfarin) in conjunction with antiplatelet therapy has been 
      shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, the rates of bleeding were 
      increased with these combination therapies; hence, triple therapy with warfarin 
      is currently only recommended in patients at low risk of bleeding. In addition, 
      there are other limitations associated with vitamin K antagonist therapy, 
      including the need for routine coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment to 
      maintain the treatment within the therapeutic range. Rivaroxaban is an oral, 
      direct Factor Xa inhibitor; in clinical practice, it is likely that rivaroxaban 
      will be given to patients who also receive antiplatelet therapy, such as 
      clopidogrel. This randomized, non-blinded, three-way crossover study investigated 
      the effect of rivaroxaban on bleeding time when co-administered with clopidogrel. 
      In addition, the influence of clopidogrel on the safety, tolerability, 
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban was investigated. Of 27 
      healthy male subjects who received a single 300 mg dose of clopidogrel, 14 were 
      identified as clopidogrel responders and were then randomized to the following 
      three treatments: (A) two doses of clopidogrel on two consecutive days (300 mg on 
      day 1; 75 mg on day 2); (B) one dose of rivaroxaban (15 mg); or (C) a combination 
      of treatments A and B (rivaroxaban given on day 2). All treatments were well 
      tolerated. Bleeding time with co-administration of rivaroxaban and clopidogrel 
      was significantly prolonged in four subjects, compared with either drug alone: 
      combination treatment increased the overall least squares-means to 3.77 times 
      baseline (90% confidence interval [CI] 2.82-4.73), compared with 1.13 times 
      baseline (90% CI 0.17-2.09) with rivaroxaban and 1.96 times baseline (90% CI 
      0.10-2.91) with clopidogrel. Co-administration of clopidogrel had no significant 
      effect on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban and, when compared with rivaroxaban 
      alone, had no further effects on Factor Xa activity or prothrombin time. 
      Inhibition of ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation by clopidogrel was not affected 
      by rivaroxaban. As expected, owing to the mode of action of each study drug, the 
      results of this study demonstrated that co-administration of the Factor Xa 
      inhibitor rivaroxaban and the antiplatelet clopidogrel increased the bleeding 
      time in healthy subjects without affecting other pharmacokinetic or 
      pharmacodynamic parameters of each drug.

TI  - Simultaneous determination of Rivaroxaban and TAK-438 in rat plasma by LC-MS/MS: 
      application to pharmacokinetic interaction study.
PG  - 11-22
LID - 10.4155/bio-2019-0130 [doi]
AB  - Aim: A sensitive and reliable LC-MS/MS method has been established and validated 
      to the quantitation of rivaroxaban (RIV) and TAK-438 in rat plasma using 
      carbamazepine as internal standard. Results: The procedure of method validation 
      was conducted according to the guidelines of EMA and US FDA. At the same time, 
      the method was applied to pharmacokinetic interactions study between RIV and 
      TAK-438 for the first time. When RIV and TAK-438 co-administration to rats, main 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of TAK-438 like AUC((0-t)), AUC((0-∞)) and C(max) had 
      statistically significant increase. The main pharmacokinetic parameters of RIV 
      have no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) when co-administered 
      except for t(1/2) (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The results indicated that drug-drug 
      interactions occurred between RIV and TAK-438 when co-administered to rats.

TI  - Serum Concentrations and Elimination Rates of Direct-Acting Oral Anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) in Older Hip Fracture Patients Hospitalized for Surgery: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 65-71
LID - 10.1007/s40266-018-0609-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is increasing, but 
      knowledge about pharmacokinetics and safety in frail patients is lacking. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine serum concentrations and elimination rates of 
      DOACs in older hip fracture patients hospitalized for surgery. METHODS: The study 
      included patients ≥ 65 years of age hospitalized for acute hip fracture surgery 
      over a period of 6 months. Use of antithrombotic drugs was registered and serum 
      samples collected for analysis of DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban) at 
      admission and surgery. Measured concentrations were assessed in relation to 
      reference (therapeutic) ranges of the respective drugs and applied for half-life 
      calculations. Furthermore, waiting time for surgery was compared between DOAC and 
      warfarin users. RESULTS: Of 167 patients included (median age 84 years), 11 and 
      14 used DOACs and warfarin, respectively. Seven of the DOAC-treated patients had 
      concentrations above the upper reference range (> 300 nM) at admission, and 
      concentrations were still in the reference range for five of these at surgery. 
      Elimination half-lives could be estimated in eight patients and ranged between 
      14.6 and 59.7 h (median 21.6). The observed waiting time for surgery was longer 
      for patients using DOACs than warfarin (median 44 vs. 25 h). CONCLUSION: This 
      pilot study indicates that older patients prone to hip fracture are at risk of 
      being exposed to therapeutic serum concentrations of DOACs during surgery due to 
      reduced drug elimination rates. The observation that almost 50% of the patients 
      had therapeutic concentrations at surgery should be investigated further 
      regarding safety of DOAC use in this frail elderly population.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetic analysis of rivaroxaban in children and comparison to 
      prospective physiologically-based pharmacokinetic predictions.
PG  - 1195-1207
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12688 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban has been investigated in the EINSTEIN-Jr program for the treatment of 
      acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children aged 0 to 18 years and in the 
      UNIVERSE program for thromboprophylaxis in children aged 2 to 8 years with 
      congenital heart disease after Fontan-procedure. Physiologically-based 
      pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modeling were used 
      throughout the pediatric development of rivaroxaban according to the 
      learn-and-confirm paradigm. The development strategy was to match pediatric drug 
      exposures to adult exposure proven to be safe and efficacious. In this analysis, 
      a refined pediatric PopPK model for rivaroxaban based on integrated EINSTEIN-Jr 
      data and interim PK data from part A of the UNIVERSE phase III study was 
      developed and the influence of potential covariates and intrinsic factors on 
      rivaroxaban exposure was assessed. The model adequately described the observed 
      pediatric PK data. PK parameters and exposure metrics estimated by the PopPK 
      model were compared to the predictions from a previously published pediatric PBPK 
      model for rivaroxaban. Ninety-one percent of the individual post hoc clearance 
      estimates were found within the 5th to 95th percentile of the PBPK model 
      predictions. In patients below 2 years of age, however, clearance was 
      underpredicted by the PBPK model. The iterative and integrative use of PBPK and 
      PopPK modeling and simulation played a major role in the establishment of the 
      bodyweight-adjusted rivaroxaban dosing regimen that was ultimately confirmed to 
      be a safe and efficacious dosing regimen for children aged 0 to 18 years with 
      acute VTE in the EINSTEIN-Jr phase III study.

TI  - Switching from rivaroxaban to warfarin: an open label pharmacodynamic study in 
      healthy subjects.
PG  - 907-17
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12559 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The primary objective was to explore the pharmacodynamic changes during 
      transition from rivaroxaban to warfarin in healthy subjects. Safety, tolerability 
      and pharmacokinetics were assessed as secondary objectives. METHODS: An open 
      label, non-randomized, sequential two period study. In treatment period 1 (TP1), 
      subjects received rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (5 days), followed by 
      co-administration with a warfarin loading dose regimen of 5 or 10 mg (for the 
      10 mg regimen, the dose could be uptitrated to attain target international 
      normalized ratio [INR] ≥2.0) once daily (2-4 days). When trough INR values ≥2.0 
      were attained, rivaroxaban was discontinued and warfarin treatment continued as 
      monotherapy (INR 2.0-3.0). During treatment period 2, subjects received the same 
      warfarin regimen as in TP1, but without rivaroxaban. RESULTS: During 
      co-administration, maximum INR and prothrombin time (PT) values were higher than 
      with rivaroxaban or warfarin monotherapy. The mean maximum effect (Emax ) for INR 
      after co-administration was 2.79-4.15 (mean PT Emax 41.0-62.7 s), compared with 
      1.41-1.74 (mean PT Emax 20.1-25.2 s) for warfarin alone. However, rivaroxaban had 
      the smallest effect on INR at trough rivaroxaban concentrations. Neither 
      rivaroxaban nor warfarin significantly affected maximum plasma concentrations of 
      the other drug. CONCLUSIONS: The combined pharmacodynamic effects during 
      co-administration of rivaroxaban and warfarin were greater than additive, but the 
      pharmacokinetics of both drugs were unaffected. Co-administration was well 
      tolerated. When transitioning from rivaroxaban to warfarin, INR monitoring during 
      co-administration should be performed at the trough rivaroxaban concentration to 
      minimize the effect of rivaroxaban on INR.

AB  - Erdafitinib is a recently approved fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 
      inhibitor. It is the first treatment targeting susceptible FGFR genetic 
      alterations for patients with metastatic bladder cancer. A simple validated 
      HPLC-UV method was developed for the determination of erdafitinib in mouse 
      plasma. Erdafitinib and internal standard (rivaroxaban) were efficiently 
      separated on Eclipse plus C18 column (4.6 × 100 mm, 3.5 µm). The mobile phase 
      consisted of acetonitrile and 0.01 M ammonium acetate aqueous solution, adjusted 
      to pH 4.4 with acetic acid (26:74, v/v) and it was eluted isocratically at a flow 
      rate of 1.2 mL/min. The UV detection was at 292 nm and the total run time for 
      each sample was 11 min. The method linearity was validated over the range of 
      0.05-2.00 µg/mL (r(2) ≥ 0.9992) and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 
      0.05 µg/mL. The within-run and between-run accuracies were 98.56 and 99.24%, 
      respectively while the CV of the method precision did not exceed 6.52%. Plasma 
      samples were extracted using a solid phase extraction procedure and the 
      extraction recoveries were 97.90 ± 4.58%. The method was optimized for the 
      sensitive determination of the studied drug in mouse plasma and was successfully 
      applied to its pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - Metabolism and excretion of rivaroxaban, an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor, in 
      rats, dogs, and humans.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is a novel, oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor for the prevention and 
      treatment of thromboembolic disorders. The objective of this study was to 
      investigate the in vivo metabolism and excretion of rivaroxaban in rats, dogs, 
      and humans. Single doses of [(14)C]rivaroxaban (3 and 1 mg/kg) were administered 
      to rats (orally/intravenously) and dogs (orally), respectively. A single oral 
      dose of [(14)C]rivaroxaban (10 mg) was administered to healthy human males (n = 
      4). Plasma and excreta were collected and profiled for radioactivity. Recovery of 
      total radioactivity was high and > or = 92% in all species. Unchanged rivaroxaban 
      was the major compound in plasma at all time points investigated, across all 
      species. No major or pharmacologically active circulating metabolites were 
      detected. Rivaroxaban and its metabolites were rapidly excreted; urinary 
      excretion of radioactivity was 25 and 52%, and fecal excretion was 67 and 43% of 
      the dose in rats and dogs, respectively. In humans, 66% of the dose was excreted 
      renally (36% unchanged drug) and 28% in the feces. Radioactivity profiles in 
      excreta were similar across species. Three metabolic pathways were identified: 
      oxidative degradation of the morpholinone moiety (major pathway) and hydrolysis 
      of the central amide bond and of the lactam amide bond in the morpholinone ring 
      (minor pathways). M-1, the main metabolite in excreta of all species, was 
      eliminated via both renal and fecal/biliary routes. In total, 82 to 89% of the 
      dose administered was assigned to unchanged rivaroxaban and its metabolites in 
      the excreta of rats, dogs, and humans.

TI  - Rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers evaluated with thrombin 
      generation and the active protein C system: Modeling and assessing 
      interindividual variability.
PG  - 1670-1682
LID - 10.1111/jth.14541 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor with substantial 
      inter-individual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability. Pharmacodynamic (PD) 
      variability, especially assessed with thrombin generation (TG), has been less 
      documented. OBJECTIVES: (i) To assess TG parameter time profiles in healthy 
      volunteers, with TG being studied under different conditions and (ii) to model 
      the relationship between rivaroxaban concentrations and TG parameters and 
      subsequently estimate interindividual variability. METHODS: Sixty healthy male 
      volunteers (DRIVING-NCT01627665) received a single 40-mg rivaroxaban dose. Blood 
      sampling was performed at baseline and 10 predefined time points over 24 h. The 
      TG was investigated with the fully automated ST-Genesia system (Stago), using two 
      tissue-factor (TF) concentrations, in the absence (-), or presence (+) of 
      thrombomodulin (TM) for the lowest one. The PD models were built to characterize 
      the relationships between plasma rivaroxaban concentrations and endogenous 
      thrombin potential (ETP) or peak height induced by the lowest TF concentration. 
      RESULTS: Thrombin generation parameter time profiles with the lowest TF 
      concentration showed a good sensitivity to rivaroxaban, especially +TM (active 
      protein C negative feedback). The relationship between rivaroxaban concentrations 
      and TG parameters was modeled with a sigmoidal relation. Mean rivaroxaban 
      concentrations halving the baseline value of ETP and peak height (-TM) (C(50) ) 
      were of 284 and 33.2 ng/mL, respectively: +TM, C(50) declined to 19.4 and 
      13.8 ng/mL, reflecting a powerful inhibitory effect. The estimated C(50) 
      population coefficients of variation were of 12.2% (-TM) and 31.3% (+TM) with the 
      peak height models, 34.8% (+TM) with the ETP model. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      low-rivaroxaban to moderate-rivaroxaban PD variability in healthy volunteers 
      contrasts with the substantial PK variability and deserves to be studied in 
      different patient settings.

TI  - An open-label study to estimate the effect of steady-state erythromycin on the 
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of a single dose of rivaroxaban in 
      subjects with renal impairment and normal renal function.
PG  - 1407-20
LID - 10.1002/jcph.352 [doi]
AB  - Two previously conducted rivaroxaban studies showed that, separately, renal 
      impairment (RI) and concomitant administration of erythromycin (P-glycoprotein 
      and moderate cytochrome P450 3A4 [CYP3A4] inhibitor) can result in increases in 
      rivaroxaban exposure. However, these studies did not assess the potential for 
      combined drug-drug-disease interactions, which-in theory-could lead to additive 
      or synergistic increases in exposure. This study investigated rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics when co-administered with steady-state (SS) 
      erythromycin in subjects with either mild or moderate RI. Similar to previous 
      studies, rivaroxaban administered alone in RI subjects, or when co-administered 
      with SS erythromycin in normal renal function (NRF) subjects, increased 
      rivaroxaban exposure. When combined, the co-administration of rivaroxaban 10 mg 
      with SS erythromycin in subjects with mild or moderate RI produced mean increases 
      in rivaroxaban AUC∞ and Cmax of approximately 76% and 56%, and 99% and 64%, 
      respectively, relative to NRF subjects, with PD changes displaying a similar 
      trend. No serious adverse events occurred and no persistent adverse events were 
      reported at the end of study. Although these increases were slightly more than 
      additive, rivaroxaban should not be used in patients with RI receiving 
      concomitant combined P-glycoprotein and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, unless the 
      potential benefit justifies the potential risk.

TI  - Enhancing the Quality of Rivaroxaban Exposure Estimates Using Prothrombin Time in 
      the Absence of Pharmacokinetic Sampling.
PG  - 805-814
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12444 [doi]
AB  - Prothrombin time (PT) is a measure of coagulation status and was assessed in the 
      majority of patients in the rivaroxaban phase II and III clinical trials as a 
      pharmacodynamic marker. In the absence of sufficient phase III pharmacokinetic 
      (PK) data to provide individual exposure measures for input into rivaroxaban 
      exposure-response analyses, the aim of the present study was to investigate the 
      use of PT-adjustment approaches (i.e., the use of observed individual PT 
      measurements) to enhance the prediction of individual rivaroxaban exposure 
      metrics (derived using a previously developed integrated population PK model) 
      based on the observed linear relationship between PT and rivaroxaban plasma 
      concentrations. The PT-adjustment approaches were established using time-matched 
      PK and PT measurements, which were available from 1,779 patients across four 
      phase II trials and one phase III trial of rivaroxaban. PT-adjusted exposure 
      estimates improved the identification of statistically significant effects when 
      compared with covariate-only exposure estimates.

      (CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein substrate) and evaluated the effect of the CYP3A and 
      P-glycoprotein inducer St John's wort (SJW) on the pharmacokinetics of these 
      drugs in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers completed this 
      open-label, monocentre, two-period, one-sequence phase I clinical trial. The 
      pharmacokinetics of macitentan (10 mg) was assessed on study days 3 (single 
      dose), 15 (steady-state), 16 (impact of rivaroxaban) and 29 (after induction by 
      oral SJW), and of rivaroxaban on days 2 (single dose), 16 (impact of macitentan 
      at steady-state) and 29 (after induction by SJW). Concurrently, we quantified 
      changes of CYP3A activity using oral microdoses of midazolam (30 μg). RESULTS: 
      Rivaroxaban and macitentan did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of 
      each other. After induction with SJW, CYP3A activity increased by 272% and 
      geometric mean ratios of macitentan AUC decreased by 48% and of C(max) by 45%. 
      Concurrently, also geometric mean ratios of rivaroxaban AUC and C(max) decreased 
      by 25%. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence for a relevant pharmacokinetic 
      interaction between macitentan and rivaroxaban suggesting that these two drugs 
      can be combined without dose adjustment. SJW strongly increased CYP3A activity 
      and substantially reduced rivaroxaban and macitentan exposure while estimated net 
      endothelin antagonism only decreased by 20%, which is considered clinically 
      irrelevant. The combination of SJW with rivaroxaban should be avoided.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In Japan, low-dose rivaroxaban [15 mg QD/10 mg QD for creatinine 
      clearance of 30-49 mL/min] was approved for clinical use in NVAF patients partly 
      because of its unique pharmacokinetics in Japanese subjects. The aim of the study 
      was to determine the anticoagulation intensity of rivaroxaban and its determinant 
      factors in Japanese stroke patients. METHODS: Consecutive stroke patients with 
      NVAF admitted between July 2012 and December 2013 were studied. Prothrombin time 
      (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and estimated plasma 
      concentration of rivaroxaban (Criv) based on an anti-factor Xa chromogenic assay 
      were measured just before and 4 and 9 h after administration at the steady state 
      level of rivaroxaban. Determinant factors for Criv were explored using a linear 
      mixed-model approach. RESULTS: Of 110 patients (37 women, 75±9 years old), 59 
      took 15 mg QD of rivaroxaban and 51 took 10 mg QD. Criv at 4 h was 186 ng/mL for 
      patients taking 15 mg QD and 147 ng/mL for those taking 10 mg QD. Both PT and 
      aPTT were positively correlated with Criv. Criv was 72% lower at 4 h in 15 
      patients receiving crushed tablets than in the other patients, and tablet 
      crushing was significantly associated with lower Criv (adjusted estimate -0.43, 
      95% CI -0.60 to -0.26) after multivariate-adjustment. CONCLUSION: The 
      anticoagulation effects of rivaroxaban in the acute stroke setting for Japanese 
      NVAF patients were relatively low as compared with those in the ROCKET-AF and 
      J-ROCKET AF trials. Tablet crushing, common in dysphagic patients, decreased 
      Criv.

TI  - In Vitro Assessment of Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interactions of Direct Oral 
      Anticoagulants: Type 5-Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors Are Inhibitors of Rivaroxaban 
      and Apixaban Efflux by P-Glycoprotein.
PG  - 519-525
LID - 10.1124/jpet.117.245993 [doi]
AB  - Because of their lower bleeding risk and simplicity of use, direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) could represent an interesting alternative to conventional 
      anticoagulant treatment with vitamin K antagonists for patients with pulmonary 
      arterial hypertension (PAH). P-glycoprotein (P-gp) plays a key role in DOAC 
      pharmacokinetics. Type 5-phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE5is), a drug class 
      commonly used in the treatment of PAH, have been shown to strongly inhibit P-gp. 
      This work aimed to assess potential P-gp-mediated drug-drug interactions between 
      PDE5is and DOACs using in vitro methods. A cellular model of drug transport 
      assay, using P-gp-overexpressing Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (transfected 
      with the human P-gp gene), was used to determine the bidirectional permeabilities 
      of two DOACs (rivaroxaban and apixaban) in the absence and presence of increasing 
      concentrations (0.5-100 µM) of three PDE5is (sildenafil, tadalafil, and 
      vardenafil). Permeabilities and efflux ratios were calculated from DOAC 
      concentrations, were measured with liquid chromatography coupled with mass 
      spectrometry, and were subsequently used to determine the PDE5i percentage of 
      inhibition and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50) ). Rivaroxaban 
      efflux was inhibited by 99%, 66%, and 100% with 100 µM sildenafil, tadalafil, and 
      vardenafil, respectively. Similarly, apixaban efflux was inhibited by 97%, 74%, 
      and 100%, respectively. The IC(50) values of the three PDE5is were 8, 28, and 5 
      µM for rivaroxaban and 23, 15, and 3 µM for apixaban, respectively. This study 
      showed strong in vitro inhibition of DOAC efflux by PDE5is. In vivo studies are 
      required to determine the clinical relevance of these interactions.

TI  - In vitro dissolution method fitted to in vivo absorption profile of rivaroxaban 
      immediate-release tablets applying in silico data.
PG  - 723-728
LID - 10.1080/03639045.2017.1411939 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate an in vitro dissolution 
      method based on in silico-in vivo data to determine whether an in vitro-in vivo 
      relationship could be established for rivaroxaban in immediate-release tablets. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Oral drugs with high permeability but poorly soluble in aqueous 
      media, such as the anticoagulant rivaroxaban, have a major potential to reach a 
      high level of in vitro-in vivo relationship. Currently, there is no study on 
      scientific literature approaching the development of RIV dissolution profile 
      based on its in vivo performance. METHODS AND RESULTS: Drug plasma concentration 
      values were modeled using computer simulation with adjustment of pharmacokinetic 
      properties. Those values were converted into drug fractions absorbed by the 
      Wagner-Nelson deconvolution approach. Gradual and continuous dissolution of RIV 
      tablets was obtained with a 30 rpm basket on 50 mM sodium acetate +0.2% SDS, pH 
      6.5 medium. Dissolution was conducted for up to 180 min. The fraction absorbed 
      was plotted against the drug fraction dissolved, and a linear point-to-point 
      regression (R(2) = 0.9961) obtained. CONCLUSION: The in vitro dissolution method 
      designed promoted a more convenient dissolution profile of RIV tablets, whereas 
      it suggests a better relationship with in vivo performance.

TI  - Minimal Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic and Drug-Drug-Disease Interaction 
      Model of Rivaroxaban and Verapamil in Healthy and Renally Impaired Subjects.
PG  - 541-548
LID - 10.1002/jcph.1044 [doi]
AB  - Current dosing recommendations for rivaroxaban advocate dosage reduction in 
      patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and avoidance of concomitant 
      strong inhibitors of CYP3A or P-glycoprotein. However, rivaroxaban dosing in 
      patients with mild renal impairment taking concomitant moderate inhibitors of 
      CYP3A and P-glycoprotein is not addressed. To quantify the impacts of concomitant 
      verapamil administration and renal impairment on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics, a 
      minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetic model system was developed and used 
      to evaluate potential increases in rivaroxaban exposure and the consequent 
      increase in risk of major bleeding. Data from a phase 1, drug-drug interaction 
      study were used to qualify the minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetic 
      model system. Model-based simulations indicate that coadministration of 
      rivaroxaban with verapamil substantially increases rivaroxaban exposure across 
      all renal function categories, resulting in an exponential increase in bleeding 
      risk. Reduction of the daily rivaroxaban dose to 10 to 15 mg reduces the major 
      bleeding risk below the designated 4.5% threshold in the majority of patients 
      with normal or mildly impaired renal function. A reduction to 10 mg daily in 
      patients with moderate to severe renal impairment provides additional risk 
      reduction so that 90% of those patients fall below the 4.5% threshold. A risk 
      threshold of 4.5% was selected because it is the median predicted risk in 
      patients treated concomitantly with ketoconazole, which is contraindicated for 
      use with rivaroxaban. Patients taking both rivaroxaban and verapamil should take 
      a reduced daily dose of rivaroxaban to minimize bleeding risk.

TI  - Peak plasma concentration of direct oral anticoagulants in obese patients 
      weighing over 120 kilograms: A retrospective study.
PG  - 684-688
LID - 10.1002/rth2.12146 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to a paucity of data on the efficacy and safety of direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with a body mass index >40 kg/m(2) or a weight 
      >120 kg, the use of DOACs in this group is not recommended. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the proportion of obese patients with body weight >120 kg with a peak 
      plasma concentration of DOACs lower than the expected median trough level derived 
      from population pharmacokinetic studies for each DOAC. METHODS: Patients with 
      body weight >120 kg taking DOACs for any indication underwent a peak drug 
      concentration measurement at steady state. RESULTS: 38 patients were included in 
      the analysis. The mean age was 64 ± 11 years, and 30 (79%) were males. The median 
      body weight was 132.5 kg (interquartile range [IQR] 127-146.5). The median peak 
      concentrations (IQR) were 148 ng/mL (138-240), 138 ng/mL (123-156.5), 215 ng/mL 
      (181-249) for apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, respectively. Two patients 
      (5%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5%-18%) had a peak plasma concentration 
      lower than the median trough and eight (21%, 95% CI: 11%-37%) had a peak plasma 
      concentration below the fifth percentile (10th percentile for dabigatran) peak 
      concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients in our study had peak plasma 
      concentration higher than the median trough level for each of the three DOACs. 
      However, 21% had a peak plasma concentration that was below the usual on-therapy 
      range of peak concentration for the corresponding DOAC.

TI  - Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics during the transition from warfarin to 
      rivaroxaban: a randomized study in healthy subjects.
PG  - 353-63
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12349 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study investigated relevant pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic 
      parameters during the transition from warfarin to rivaroxaban in healthy male 
      subjects. METHODS: Ninety-six healthy men were randomized into the following 
      three groups: warfarin [international normalized ratio (INR) 2.0-3.0] 
      transitioned to rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (od; group A); warfarin (INR 
      2.0-3.0) followed by placebo od (group B); and rivaroxaban alone 20 mg od (group 
      C) for 4 days. Anti-factor Xa activity, inhibition of factor Xa activity, 
      prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time, HepTest, 
      prothrombinase-induced clotting time, factor VIIa activity, factor IIa activity, 
      endogenous thrombin potential and pharmacokinetics were measured. RESULTS: An 
      additive effect was observed on the PT and PT/INR during the initial transition 
      period. The mean maximal prolongation of PT was 4.39-fold [coefficient of 
      variation (CV) 18.03%; range 3.39-6.50] of the baseline value in group A, 
      compared with 1.88-fold (CV 10.35%; range 1.53-2.21) in group B and 1.57-fold (CV 
      9.98%; range 1.37-2.09) in group C. Rivaroxaban had minimal influence on the 
      PT/INR at trough levels. Inhibition of factor Xa activity, activated partial 
      thromboplastin time and endogenous thrombin potential were also enhanced, but to 
      a lesser extent. In contrast, the effects of rivaroxaban on anti-factor Xa 
      activity, HepTest and prothrombinase-induced clotting time were not affected by 
      pretreatment with warfarin. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in pharmacodynamics during the 
      transition from warfarin to rivaroxaban vary depending on the test used. A 
      supra-additive effect on PT/INR is expected during the initial period of 
      transition, but pretreatment with warfarin does not influence the effect of 
      rivaroxaban on anti-factor Xa activity.

TI  - Applications of Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling of 
      Rivaroxaban-Renal and Hepatic Impairment and Drug-Drug Interaction Potential.
PG  - 656-665
LID - 10.1002/jcph.1784 [doi]
AB  - The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban is used in several 
      thromboembolic disorders. Rivaroxaban is eliminated via both metabolic 
      degradation and renal elimination as unchanged drug. Therefore, renal and hepatic 
      impairment may reduce rivaroxaban clearance, and medications inhibiting these 
      clearance pathways could lead to drug-drug interactions. This physiologically 
      based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) study investigated the pharmacokinetic behavior of 
      rivaroxaban in clinical situations where drug clearance is impaired. A PBPK model 
      was developed using mass balance and bioavailability data from adults and 
      qualified using clinically observed data. Renal and hepatic impairment were 
      simulated by adjusting disease-specific parameters, and concomitant drug use was 
      simulated by varying enzyme activity in virtual populations (n = 1000) and 
      compared with pharmacokinetic predictions in virtual healthy populations and 
      clinical observations. Rivaroxaban doses of 10 mg or 20 mg were used. Mild to 
      moderate renal impairment had a minor effect on area under the concentration-time 
      curve and maximum plasma concentration of rivaroxaban, whereas severe renal 
      impairment caused a more pronounced increase in these parameters vs normal renal 
      function. Area under the concentration-time curve and maximum plasma 
      concentration increased with severity of hepatic impairment. These effects were 
      smaller in the simulations compared with clinical observations. AUC and C(max) 
      increased with the strength of cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors 
      in simulations and clinical observations. This PBPK model can be useful for 
      estimating the effects of impaired drug clearance on rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics. Identifying other factors that affect the pharmacokinetics of 
      rivaroxaban could facilitate the development of models that approximate 
      real-world pharmacokinetics more accurately.

TI  - Rivaroxaban, a new, oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor for thromboprophylaxis after 
      major joint arthroplasty.
PG  - 1083-8
LID - 10.1517/14656560902835513 [doi]
AB  - The new oral, antithrombotic drug rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor, 
      which can restrict thrombin generation both in vitro and in vivo. It has a 
      predictable dose-dependent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and is 
      well tolerated. In patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty, 
      rivaroxaban, 10 mg once daily started 6 - 8 h after the operation, had a 
      significantly better antithrombotic efficacy and a comparable safety when 
      compared with enoxaparin. Furthermore in all studies performed the drug had no 
      adverse influence on the liver function in comparison with enoxaparin. In 
      conclusion, rivaroxaban is a potent and safe new compound for antithrombotic 
      prophylaxis in orthopaedic surgery.

TI  - Residual rivaroxaban exposure after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy in 
      patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.
PG  - 611-618
LID - 10.1007/s00228-018-2421-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) frequently 
      undergo interventional procedures requiring temporary discontinuation of 
      anticoagulant therapy. Little is known about remaining peri-procedural exposure 
      to rivaroxaban in real-world patients. METHODS: Fifty-six patients with 
      rivaroxaban treatment and scheduled cardiac catheterization were included in this 
      prospective, observational, and single-center study. Rivaroxaban concentrations 
      were determined by LC-MS/MS and a chromogenic anti-Xa assay. Population 
      pharmacokinetic modeling was carried out on LC-MS/MS concentration data using 
      NONMEM software, and results were applied to Monte Carlo simulations to predict 
      appropriate rivaroxaban discontinuation intervals. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban 
      concentrations ranged from <LLOQ to 300.6 ng/ml at the time of admission to 
      hospital and from <LLOQ to 55.5 ng/ml at the beginning of the procedure. Times 
      since last rivaroxaban intake were (mean ± SD) 51.0 ± 31.7 h (admission) and 
      85.5 ± 36.8 h (start catheterization). LC-MS/MS and anti-Xa assay results were in 
      good agreement (r = 0.958); however, the anti-Xa assay may underestimate low 
      rivaroxaban concentrations and overestimate rivaroxaban exposure when performed 
      on plasma samples contaminated with heparins. Pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban 
      were adequately described, and simulations predicted that 95% of patients will 
      have rivaroxaban concentrations ≤ 28.4 ng/ml (15 mg dose group) and ≤ 31.9 ng/ml 
      (20 mg dose group) after 48 h of discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of 
      patients, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations dropped below 30 ng/ml after 48 h of 
      treatment discontinuation which is considered hemostatically safe before surgery 
      with high bleeding risk. For accurate determination of low rivaroxaban 
      concentrations, LC-MS/MS is the preferred choice.

TI  - Evaluation of a Heparin-Calibrated Antifactor Xa Assay for Measuring the 
      Anticoagulant Effect of Oral Direct Xa Inhibitors.
PG  - 423-8
LID - 10.1177/1076029616629759 [doi]
AB  - The introduction of oral direct anti-Xa anticoagulants apixaban and rivaroxaban 
      has significantly impacted the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic 
      disease. Clinical scenarios exist in which a quantitative assessment for degree 
      of anticoagulation due to these agents would aid management. The purpose of this 
      work was to evaluate the chromogenic antifactor Xa assay calibrated with heparin 
      standards at our institution for assessment of intensity of anticoagulation with 
      rivaroxaban or apixaban in addition to its current use for unfractionated heparin 
      or low-molecular-weight heparin. We also aimed to propose expected steady state 
      peak and trough antifactor Xa activities for these agents based upon dosing 
      regimens approved for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Antifactor Xa activity 
      correlated very strongly with apixaban and rivaroxaban concentration in both 
      spiked samples and treated patient plasma samples (r (2) = .99, P < .001). This 
      correlation was observed over a broad range (20-500 ng/mL) of drug 
      concentrations, as sample dilution with pooled normal plasma significantly 
      extended the range of quantitative assessment. Based on drug concentrations 
      previously published in pharmacokinetic studies, the expected steady state peak 
      and trough antifactor Xa activity ranges for apixaban are 1.80 to 2.20 IU/mL and 
      0.70 to 1.10 IU/mL, respectively. For rivaroxaban, these ranges are 3.80 to 6.20 
      IU/mL and 0.60 to 1.00 IU/mL, respectively. In conclusion, our findings 
      demonstrate that heparin-calibrated antifactor Xa activity correlates strongly 
      with apixaban and rivaroxaban concentration. The dilution of samples allowed for 
      this correlation to be extended over the majority of on-therapy drug 
      concentrations.

TI  - Effect of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1 Gene Polymorphisms on Rivaroxaban 
      Pharmacokinetics in Patients Undergoing Total Hip and Knee Replacement Surgery.
PG  - 413-420
LID - 10.1007/s40292-019-00342-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Population ageing in developed countries will inevitably increase 
      the need for knee and hip replacement surgery. Over the years, direct oral 
      anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban, have been widely used for thromboprophylaxis 
      in patients undergoing knee and hip replacement surgery. The study of 
      pharmacogenetic characteristics of rivaroxaban is important for enhancing the 
      effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban thromboprophylaxis. AIM: Evaluation of 
      CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and ABCB1 gene polymorphisms influence on rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics and prothrombin time dynamics in patients undergoing total hip 
      and knee replacement surgery. METHODS: The study included 78 patients undergoing 
      total hip and knee replacement surgery. The patients received 10 mg of 
      rivaroxaban once a day. Genotyping of polymorphisms ABCB1 rs1045642, ABCB1 
      rs4148738, CYP3A4 rs35599367 and CYP3A5 rs776746 was performed. Peak steady-state 
      and trough steady-state rivaroxaban concentrations were determined. Prothrombin 
      time was also evaluated. RESULTS: The study revealed the following haplotypes: 
      (1) ABCB1 rs1045642-CYP3A4 rs35599367 and (2) ABCB1 rs4148738-CYP3A4 rs35599367. 
      The analysis of the peak steady-state rivaroxaban concentration between mutant 
      haplotypes and wild haplotypes revealed no significant differences. However, 
      there was a statistically significant average correlation between peak 
      steady-state rivaroxaban concentration and prothrombin time (r = 0.421; 
      r(2) = 0.178; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: No significant difference was identified in 
      peak steady-state rivaroxaban concentration between mutant haplotypes and wild 
      haplotypes. The revealed statistically significant average correlation between 
      the prothrombin time and peak steady-state rivaroxaban concentration is important 
      in clinical practice for assessing the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban.

AB  - The direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, as well as the direct factor Xa 
      inhibtors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, display pharmacodynamic features 
      quite similar to low-molecular-weight heparins, with a time to peak level of 1-4 
      hours after oral administration, and a half-life between 5 and 14 hours. All 
      drugs display a linear relationship and a high degree of correlation between drug 
      levels in plasma, and the anticoagulant effect. Major differences are the extent 
      of renal elimination (with 80% or more for dabigatran, 66% for rivaroxaban [33% 
      unchanged, active drug, and 33% inactive metabolites], 33% for edoxaban, and 
      finally, 25% for apixaban), and bioavailability, which determines the amount of 
      drug required for attaining the target plasma concentration of the drug. Due to 
      the reliable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, no routine laboratory 
      monitoring is necessary, although dedicated laboratory assays are available for 
      emergencies and some other specific conditions.

TI  - Investigation of Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Interactions Between 
      Rivaroxaban and Enoxaparin in Healthy Male Subjects.
PG  - 270-7
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.26 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban, an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor, is currently used in clinical 
      practice for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. This 
      single-center, three-way crossover study was designed to investigate the 
      pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban (10 mg) and enoxaparin (40 mg) alone and 
      in combination as well as the influence of enoxaparin on the pharmacokinetics of 
      rivaroxaban in healthy male subjects. When given alone, both drugs exhibited 
      similar, rapid anti-factor Xa activity. Combined administration resulted in an 
      increase of ∼50% in anti-factor Xa activity and a lesser increase in activated 
      partial thromboplastin time, compared with either drug alone. Enoxaparin had no 
      additional effect on prolongation of the prothrombin time induced by rivaroxaban 
      and did not affect the pharmacokinetic parameters of rivaroxaban. The results 
      showed that rivaroxaban (10 mg) and enoxaparin (40 mg) had a similar and rapid 
      onset of action, as indicated by the similar anti-factor Xa activity-time curves, 
      suggesting that both drugs have a similar duration of pharmacological activity at 
      the factor X site. Co-administration of rivaroxaban and enoxaparin is associated 
      with enhanced pharmacodynamic effects.

TI  - The Development and Optimization of Hot-Melt Extruded Amorphous Solid Dispersions 
      Containing Rivaroxaban in Combination with Polymers.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13030344 [doi]
LID - 344
AB  - Rivaroxaban (RXB), a novel oral anticoagulant that directly inhibits factor Xa, 
      is a poorly soluble drug belonging to Biopharmaceutics Classification System 
      (BCS) class II. In this study, a hot-melt extruded amorphous solid dispersion 
      (HME-ASD) containing RXB is prepared by changing the drug:polymer ratio 
      (Polyvinylpyrrolidione-vinyl acetate 64, 1:1-1:4) and barrel temperature (200-240 
      °C), fixed at 20% of Cremophor(®) RH 40 and 15 rpm of the screw speed, using the 
      hot-melt extruding technique. This study evaluates the solubility, dissolution 
      behavior, and bioavailability for application to oral drug delivery and optimizes 
      the formulation of rivaroxaban amorphous solid dispersion (RXB-ASD). Based on a 
      central composite design, optimized RXB-ASD (PVP VA 64 ratio 1:4.1, barrel 
      temperature 216.1 °C, Cremophor(®) RH 40 20%, screw speed 15 rpm) showed 
      satisfactory results for dependent variables. An in vitro drug dissolution study 
      exhibited relatively high dissolution in four media and achieved around an 80% 
      cumulative drug release in 120 min. Optimized RXB-ASD was stable under the 
      accelerated condition for three months without a change in crystallinity and the 
      dissolution rate. A pharmacokinetic study of RXB-ASD in rats showed that the 
      absorption was markedly increased in terms of rate and amount, i.e., the systemic 
      exposure values, compared to raw RXB powder. These results showed the application 
      of quality by design (QbD) in the formulation development of hot-melt extruded 
      RXB-ASD, which can be used as an oral drug delivery system by increasing the 
      dissolution rate and bioavailability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The chromogenic anti-Xa assay, the gold standard for monitoring the 
      anti-Xa effect of rivaroxaban, is not available as a cage-side diagnostic test 
      for use in a clinical setting. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate clinical 
      modalities for measuring the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban using a 
      point-of-care prothrombin time (PT) and thromboelastography (TEG). ANIMALS: Six 
      healthy Beagle dogs. METHODS: Prospective, experimental study. Four different 
      doses of rivaroxaban (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg) were administered PO to dogs. 
      Single PO and 3 consecutive dosing regimens also were assessed. Plasma 
      rivaroxaban concentration was determined using a chromogenic anti-Xa assay, 
      point-of-care PT, and TEG analysis with 4 activators (RapidTEG, 1 : 100 tissue 
      factor [TF100], 1 : 3700 tissue factor [TF3700], and kaolin), and results were 
      compared. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between ratios (peak 
      to baseline PT; peak reaction time [R] of TEG to baseline [R] of TEG) and anti-Xa 
      concentration. RESULTS: Anti-Xa concentration had a significant correlation with 
      point-of-care PT (R = 0.82, P < .001) and RapidTEG-TEG, TF100-TEG, and TF3700-TEG 
      (R = 0.76, P < .001; R = 0.82, P < .001; and R = 0.83, P < .001, respectively). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Overall, a 1.5-1.9 × delay in PT and R 
      values of TEG 3 hours after rivaroxaban administration is required to achieve 
      therapeutic anti-Xa concentrations of rivaroxaban in canine plasma. The R values 
      of TEG, specifically using tissue factors (RapidTEG, TF100, TF3700) and 
      point-of-care PT for rivaroxaban can be used practically for therapeutic 
      monitoring of rivaroxaban in dogs.

AB  - Essentials There is currently no approved reversal agent for factor Xa (FXa) 
      inhibitors Andexanet alfa has been developed to reverse the anticoagulant effects 
      of FXa inhibitors Andexanet reduced blood loss and anticoagulation markers in 
      rivaroxaban-anticoagulated rabbits Andexanet was well tolerated in monkeys and 
      rats, with no evidence of prothrombotic activity SUMMARY: Background Andexanet 
      alfa is a recombinant modified form of factor Xa (FXa), designed to bind to and 
      reverse the anticoagulant activity of FXa inhibitors. Objectives To evaluate the 
      ability of andexanet to reverse the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban, and 
      assess its pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicity in animal models. Methods The 
      effects of andexanet on blood loss, anti-FXa activity, rivaroxaban unbound plasma 
      concentrations and other coagulation parameters were assessed in a rabbit liver 
      laceration 'treatment' model. Andexanet was administered 10 min after blood loss 
      was initiated. The toxicity of repeated administration of andexanet (up to 60 mg 
      kg(-1) day(-1) ) was assessed in cynomolgus monkeys. PK parameters were evaluated 
      in rats and monkeys. Results Excess blood loss due to anticoagulation with 
      rivaroxaban was significantly decreased by a single intravenous bolus 
      administration of andexanet at 35 and 75 mg per rabbit, by 75% and 63%, 
      respectively. This correlated with dose-dependent decreases in the unbound 
      fraction of rivaroxaban and anti-FXa activity. Co-administration of rivaroxaban 
      had no significant impact on the PK parameters of andexanet. Andexanet (up to 60 
      mg kg(-1) day(-1) ) was well tolerated in monkeys, with no accumulation of 
      andexanet or rivaroxaban. There was a single occurrence of anaphylaxis, which 
      resolved after treatment with diphenhydramine and epinephrine. There was no 
      histological evidence of prothrombotic activity with high-dose andexanet compared 
      with vehicle control, as measured by clot and fibrin deposition in all major 
      organs. Conclusions These data suggest that andexanet is a promising therapy for 
      the reversal of FXa inhibitor-induced anticoagulation, supporting clinical 
      studies in humans.

AB  - The blood coagulation enzyme factor Xa (FXa) is a particularly promising target 
      for anticoagulant therapy, and identification of oral small-molecule inhibitors 
      of FXa remains a research focus. On the basis of the X-ray crystal structure of 
      FXa and its inhibitor rivaroxaban, we designed and synthesized a series of 
      conformationally restricted mimics containing a novel [6,6,5] tricyclic fused 
      oxazolidinone scaffold. Intensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) and 
      structure-pharmacokinetic relationship (SPR) studies on this new series led to 
      the discovery of compound 11a: a highly potent, selective, direct, and orally 
      bioavailable FXa inhibitor with excellent in vivo antithrombotic efficacy and 
      preferable pharmacokinetic profiles. Druggability evaluation of compound 11a was 
      undertaken and elicited positive outcomes. All results indicate that compound 11a 
      is a promising drug candidate for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic 
      diseases in venous and arterial systems.

TI  - On Absorption Modeling and Food Effect Prediction of Rivaroxaban, a BCS II Drug 
      Orally Administered as an Immediate-Release Tablet.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13020283 [doi]
LID - 283
AB  - The present work evaluates the food effect on the absorption of rivaroxaban 
      (Riva), a BCS II drug, from the orally administered commercial immediate-release 
      tablet (Xarelto IR) using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and 
      conventional in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) models. The bioavailability of 
      Riva upon oral administration of Xarelto IR tablet is reported to exhibit a 
      positive food effect. The PBPK model for Riva was developed and verified using 
      the previously reported in vivo data for oral solution (5 and 10 mg) and Xarelto 
      IR tablet (5 and 10 mg dose strength). Once the PBPK model was established, the 
      in vivo performance of the tablet formulation with the higher dose strength 
      (Xarelto IR tablet 20 mg in fasted and fed state) was predicted using the 
      experimentally obtained data of in vitro permeability, biorelevant solubility and 
      in vitro dynamic dissolution data using United States Pharmacopeia (USP) IV 
      flow-through cell apparatus. In addition, the mathematical IVIVC model was 
      developed using the in vitro dissolution and in vivo profile of 20 mg strength 
      Xarelto IR tablet in fasted condition. Using the developed IVIVC model, the 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the Xarelto IR tablet in fed condition was 
      predicted and compared with the PK parameters obtained via the PBPK model. A 
      virtual in vivo PK study was designed using a single-dose, 3-treatment cross-over 
      trial in 50 subjects to predict the PK profile of the Xarelto® IR tablet in the 
      fed state. Overall, the results obtained from the IVIVC model were found to be 
      comparable with those from the PBPK model. The outcome from both models pointed 
      to the positive food effect on the in vivo profile of the Riva. The developed 
      models thus can be effectively extended to establish bioequivalence for the 
      marketed and novel complex formulations of Riva such as amorphous solid 
      dispersions.

TI  - Body weight has limited influence on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, 
      or pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) in healthy subjects.
PG  - 218-26
AB  - Anticoagulants are often dose adjusted, or their use restricted, in patients with 
      extremes of body weight. Rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) is a novel, oral, direct 
      factor Xa inhibitor in clinical development. This was a randomized, single-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in healthy male and female subjects to 
      assess the effect of extreme body weight (< or = 50 kg and >120 kg), and gender, 
      on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of 
      rivaroxaban 10 mg, compared with subjects of normal weight (70-80 kg). 
      Rivaroxaban was well tolerated. Cmax of rivaroxaban was unaffected in subjects 
      >120 kg but was increased by 24% in subjects weighing < or = 50 kg, resulting in 
      a small (15%) increase in prolongation of prothrombin time, which was not 
      considered clinically relevant. The area under the curve was unaffected by body 
      weight or gender. No other clinically relevant differences were observed, 
      suggesting that rivaroxaban is unlikely to require dose adjustment for body 
      weight or gender.

TI  - Co-administration of rivaroxaban with drugs that share its elimination pathways: 
      pharmacokinetic effects in healthy subjects.
PG  - 455-66
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12075 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The anticoagulant rivaroxaban is an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor for 
      the management of thromboembolic disorders. Metabolism and excretion involve 
      cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and 2J2 (CYP2J2), CYP-independent mechanisms, and 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) (ABCG2). 
      METHODS: The pharmacokinetic effects of substrates or inhibitors of CYP3A4, P-gp 
      and Bcrp (ABCG2) on rivaroxaban were studied in healthy volunteers. RESULTS: 
      Rivaroxaban did not interact with midazolam (CYP3A4 probe substrate). Exposure to 
      rivaroxaban when co-administered with midazolam was slightly decreased by 11% 
      (95% confidence interval [CI] -28%, 7%) compared with rivaroxaban alone. The 
      following drugs moderately affected rivaroxaban exposure, but not to a clinically 
      relevant extent: erythromycin (moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor; 34% increase [95% 
      CI 23%, 46%]), clarithromycin (strong CYP3A4/moderate P-gp inhibitor; 54% 
      increase [95% CI 44%, 64%]) and fluconazole (moderate CYP3A4, possible Bcrp 
      [ABCG2] inhibitor; 42% increase [95% CI 29%, 56%]). A significant increase in 
      rivaroxaban exposure was demonstrated with the strong CYP3A4, P-gp/Bcrp (ABCG2) 
      inhibitors (and potential CYP2J2 inhibitors) ketoconazole (158% increase [95% CI 
      136%, 182%] for a 400 mg once daily dose) and ritonavir (153% increase [95% CI 
      134%, 174%]). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that rivaroxaban may be 
      co-administered with CYP3A4 and/or P-gp substrates/moderate inhibitors, but not 
      with strong combined CYP3A4, P-gp and Bcrp (ABCG2) inhibitors (mainly comprising 
      azole-antimycotics, apart from fluconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors), which 
      are multi-pathway inhibitors of rivaroxaban clearance and elimination.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban after bariatric surgery: a case report.
PG  - 533-5
LID - 10.1007/s11239-013-0891-2 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor, which is rapidly absorbed in the 
      upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In large trials, it has been shown to be 
      effective and safe in VTE treatment. However, in these trials patients with 
      morbid obesity were not reported and it is unknown if the standard dosage of 20 
      mg rivaroxaban is sufficient for bariatric patients, especially after bariatric 
      surgery, which may impact the resorption of rivaroxaban. We report the case of a 
      bariatric patient with high venous thromboembolism risk and instable INR after 
      recent bariatric surgery, who was switched from Vitamin-K antagonists to 
      rivaroxaban. After intake of 20 mg rivaroxaban, plasma concentration were 
      repeatedly measured until 3 h after the second dose using a commercially 
      available chromogenic aXa-assay. Furthermore, INR and aPTT were measured. Peak 
      concentrations of 224.22 ng/ml were observed. After 6 h, plasma concentration 
      decreased to 86.9 ng/ml and remained stable until 12 h (86.32 ng/ml). After 24 h, 
      a trough level of 35.54 ng/ml was observed. The patients INR did immediately 
      increase and remained significantly elevated throughout the day with a slow 
      decrease. Since peak values of rivaroxaban plasma concentrations were in the 
      expected range of published data, we conclude that resorption of rivaroxaban was 
      immediate and not significantly impaired by bariatric surgery of the upper GI 
      tract. Consequently, no dose adjustments seem to be necessary in this high-risk 
      population.

TI  - Rivaroxaban crushed tablet suspension characteristics and relative 
      bioavailability in healthy adults when administered orally or via nasogastric 
      tube.
PG  - 321-7
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.123 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Because some patients have difficulty swallowing a whole tablet, we 
      investigated the relative bioavailability of a crushed 20 mg rivaroxaban tablet 
      and of 2 alternative crushed tablet dosing strategies. METHODS: Stability and 
      nasogastric (NG) tube adsorption characteristics of a crushed rivaroxaban tablet 
      were assessed. Then, in 55 healthy adults, relative bioavailability of 
      rivaroxaban administered orally as a whole tablet (Reference [Whole-Oral]), 
      crushed tablet in applesauce suspension (Crushed-Oral), or crushed tablet in 
      water suspension via NG tube (Crushed-NG) were determined. RESULTS: There were no 
      significant changes in mean percent of non-degraded rivaroxaban recovered over 
      4 hours from crushed tablet suspensions (>98.4% recovery across all suspensions 
      and time points) or after NG tube exposure (recovery: 99.1% for silicone and 
      98.9% for polyvinyl chloride NG tubes). Relative bioavailability was similar 
      between Crushed-Oral and Reference dosing (Cmax and AUC∞ were within the 80-125% 
      bioequivalence limits). Relative bioavailability was also similar between the 
      Crushed-NG and Reference dosing (AUC∞ was within bioequivalence limits; Cmax [90% 
      CI range: 78.5-85.8%] was only slightly below the 80% lower bioequivalence 
      limit). CONCLUSIONS: A crushed rivaroxaban tablet was stable and when 
      administered orally or via NG tube, displayed similar relative bioavailability 
      compared to a whole tablet administered orally.

TI  - [Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the new oral anticoagulants dabigatran 
      and rivaroxaban].
PG  - 125-33
AB  - Dabigatran is the first available oral direct thrombin inhibitor anticoagulant. 
      Absorption of the prodrug, dabigatran etexilate and its conversion to dabigatran 
      is rapid (peak plasma concentrations are reached 4-6 hours following surgery, and 
      a further 2 hours later). Its oral bioavailability is low, but shows reduced 
      interindividual variability. Dabigatran specifically and reversibly inhibits 
      thrombin, the key enzyme in the coagulation cascade. Studies both in healthy 
      volunteers and in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery show a 
      predictable pk/pd profile that allows for fixed-dose regimens. The anticoagulant 
      effect correlates adequately with the plasma concentrations of the drug, 
      demonstrating effective anticoagulation combined with a low risk of bleeding. 
      Dabigatran is mainly eliminated by renal excretion (a fact which affects the 
      dosage in elderly and in moderate-severe renal failure patients), and no hepatic 
      metabolism by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes has been observed, showing a good 
      interaction profile. Rivaroxaban will probably be the first available oral factor 
      Xa (FXa) direct inhibitor anticoagulant drug. It produces a reversible and 
      predictable inhibition of FXa activity with potential to inhibit clot-bound FXa. 
      Its pharmacokinetic characteristics include rapid absorption, high oral 
      availability, high plasma protein binding and a half-life of aprox. 8 hours. 
      Rivaroxaban elimination is mainly renal, but also through faecal matter and by 
      hepatic metabolism. Although the drug has demonstrated moderate potential to 
      interact with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, it does not inhibit or induce any major

TI  - Microdosed Cocktail of Three Oral Factor Xa Inhibitors to Evaluate Drug-Drug 
      Interactions with Potential Perpetrator Drugs.
PG  - 1155-1163
LID - 10.1007/s40262-019-00749-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to prove the suitability of simultaneously 
      administered microdoses of the factor Xa inhibitors (FXaIs) rivaroxaban, apixaban 
      and edoxaban (100 µg in total). To evaluate drug-drug interactions, the impact of 
      ketoconazole, a known strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein, 
      was studied. METHODS: In a crossover clinical trial, 18 healthy volunteers were 
      randomized to the two treatments using microdoses of rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban alone and when coadministered with ketoconazole. Plasma and urine 
      concentrations of microdosed apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban were quantified 
      using a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification of 2.5 pg/ml. RESULTS: 
      The microdosed FXaI cocktail showed similar pharmacokinetic parameters compared 
      with published data, using normal therapeutic doses of each FXaI. Ketoconazole 
      significantly increased exposure, with geometric mean AUC ratios of 1.90 
      (apixaban), 2.35 (edoxaban) and 2.27 (rivaroxaban). CONCLUSION: The microdosed 
      FXaI cocktail approach was able to precisely predict the drug interaction with 
      ketoconazole. This is the first study that has been conducted to evaluate 
      drug-drug interactions with a drug class, and the low administered doses also 
      allow evaluation in vulnerable target populations. STUDY PROTOCOL: EudraCT 
      2016-003024-23.

AB  - Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is a new oral, direct and selective inhibitor of the factor 
      Xa of the coagulation cascade. The main pharmacokinetic characteristics of 
      rivaroxaban are a bioavailability of approximately 80-100%, a maximum 
      concentration obtained in 2 to 4 hours, a terminal half-life of elimination of 7 
      to 11 hours, a renal elimination for 1/3 for the active hepatic metabolism from 
      the cytochrome P450 (3A4) for the other 2/3. The main sources of variability are 
      the renal and the liver function and potential interactions with some strong 
      inhibitors or inducers of the CYP450 3A4. Phase II clinical studies have shown 
      that this compound can be orally administrated, once or twice daily, without any 
      biological monitoring and without any need for dose adjustment. There is a 
      contra-indication in case of severe liver insufficiency and not recommended in 
      case of severe renal impairment. Pharmacodynamically, Rivaroxaban is a direct and 
      selective factor Xa inhibitor without any effect on the factor IIa and without 
      any interaction on platelets. Four phases II with 2787 patients were carried out 
      to for venous thromboembolic (VTE) prophylaxis after major orthopaedic surgery, 
      showing that 10 mg once daily could be the optimal dose regimen to assess in 
      phase III. Two phases II with 1446 patients were carried out for the treatment of 
      VTE showing that 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks and then 20 mg once daily could be 
      the optimal dose regimen to evaluate in the following phases 3. No strong signal 
      for a potential liver toxicity was shown during these 6 phases II.

AB  - No data are available on rivaroxaban use in renal transplant recipients and on 
      its surmised interaction with immunosuppressants. The aim was to investigate 
      potential interactions between rivaroxaban and immunosuppressants in this 
      setting. Renal transplant recipients with a stable renal function treated with 
      rivaroxaban and tacrolimus with or without everolimus were investigated. All 
      drugs and creatinine concentrations were determined daily for 2 weeks after the 
      start of anticoagulation. Blood samples were drawn at 8.00 am and 3-4 h later for 
      trough and peak concentrations, respectively. Bleeding and thrombotic events were 
      recorded during a minimum follow-up of 6 months. In 8 renal transplant patients, 
      rivaroxaban levels showed a predictable pharmacokinetic trend, both at C(trough) 
      (30-61 μg/L) and at C(peak) (143-449 μg/L), with limited variability in the 
      25th-75th percentile range. Tacrolimus (C(trough) 3-13 μg/L; C(peak) 3-16 μg/L), 
      everolimus (C(trough) 3-11 μg/L; C(peak) 5-17 μg/L) and creatinine concentrations 
      were stable as well. Immunosuppressors variability before and after rivaroxaban 
      were 30% and 30% for tacrolimus, 27% and 29% for everolimus, respectively, as 
      well as 14% and 3% for creatinine. For rivaroxaban monitoring, the reference 
      change value better performed in identifying significant variations of its 
      concentration. No patient had bleeding or thrombotic events, worsening of renal 
      graft function, and signs of immunosuppressants toxicity during a mean follow-up 
      of 23 (9-28) months. In conclusion, rivaroxaban does not seem to interact with 
      tacrolimus and everolimus in renal transplant recipients. Both anticoagulant and 
      immunosuppressive effects seem warranted, without major bleeding complications 
      and effect on the graft function.

TI  - The influence of feeding and gastroprotectant medications on the Factor Xa 
      inhibitory activity of orally administered rivaroxaban in normal dogs.
PG  - 59-65
LID - 10.1111/vec.13019 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rivaroxaban is a new anticoagulant option for dogs, yet its reported 
      oral bioavailability is as low as 60%. The objective of this study was to examine 
      the influence of feeding and gastroprotectant medications on the bioactivity 
      (anti-Xa activity) of rivaroxaban in healthy dogs. DESIGN: Prospective 
      experimental study. SETTING: University research laboratory. ANIMALS: Five 
      healthy neutered male purpose-bred Beagles. INTERVENTIONS: Dogs were administered 
      a median dose of 1.8 mg/kg rivaroxaban (range, 1.6-1.8 mg/kg) orally once daily 
      for 2 consecutive days with either (1) no food, (2) food, (3) sucralfate 30 
      minutes before rivaroxaban, or (4) omeprazole at the same time as rivaroxaban. 
      Blood was collected from preplaced jugular catheters immediately before and at 6 
      time points after rivaroxaban administration (2, 4, 8, 24, 36, and 48 hours). A 
      rivaroxaban calibrated anti-Xa activity assay (RIVA) was used to monitor 
      anticoagulant effect. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Rivaroxaban administration 
      resulted in significant increases in RIVA (P = 0.02), with peak activities 
      occurring 2 to 4 hours after dosingduring each study arm. No feeding was 
      associated with significantly higher RIVA at the 36-hour time point compared to 
      all other treatment arms (P < 0.0001), and feeding resulted in high RIVA at the 
      48-hour time point compared with sucralfate administration (P = 0.003). No 
      significant changes in RIVA were otherwise identified with respect to feeding or 
      gastroprotectant administration (P = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: 
      Although administration without food demonstrated an apparent increase in RIVA 
      36 hours after drug administration, clinically relevant differences among 
      treatment groups were not identified in combined analyses of time points. Based 
      on these results, dogs treated with rivaroxaban do not require special 
      modification of feeding practices or gastroprotectant drug administration.

TI  - Rivaroxaban and other novel oral anticoagulants: pharmacokinetics in healthy 
      subjects, specific patient populations and relevance of coagulation monitoring.

AB  - Unlike traditional anticoagulants, the more recently developed agents 
      rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban target specific factors in the coagulation 
      cascade to attenuate thrombosis. Rivaroxaban and apixaban directly inhibit Factor 
      Xa, whereas dabigatran directly inhibits thrombin. All three drugs exhibit 
      predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics that allow for 
      fixed oral doses in a variety of settings. The population pharmacokinetics of 
      rivaroxaban, and also dabigatran, have been evaluated in a series of models using 
      patient data from phase II and III clinical studies. These models point towards a 
      consistent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile, even when extreme 
      demographic factors are taken into account, meaning that doses rarely need to be 
      adjusted. The exception is in certain patients with renal impairment, for whom 
      pharmacokinetic modelling provided the rationale for reduced doses as part of 
      some regimens. Although not routinely required, the ability to measure plasma 
      concentrations of these agents could be advantageous in emergency situations, 
      such as overdose. Specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics 
      must be taken into account when selecting an appropriate assay for monitoring. 
      The anti-Factor Xa chromogenic assays now available are likely to provide the 
      most appropriate means of determining plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban, and specific assays for dabigatran are in development.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) intra- and inter-individual 
      variability was previously reported, but its magnitude is still considered 
      negligible for patient management. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate inter- and 
      intra-individual variability in real-world atrial fibrillation patients on 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban in four Italian anticoagulation clinics and 
      to assess the correlation between DOAC plasma concentration and 
      creatinine-clearance (CrCl). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 330 consecutive 
      patients were enrolled, of which 160 were on dabigatran (70 and 90 taking 150 mg 
      or 110 mg twice-daily, respectively), 71 on rivaroxaban (37 and 34 taking 20mg or 
      15 mg once-daily) and 99 on apixaban (73 and 26 taking 5mg or 2.5mg twice-daily). 
      Blood was taken at trough and peak within the first month (15-25 days) of 
      treatment. Diluted-thrombin-time (dTT) calibrated for dabigatran and anti-FXa 
      calibrated for rivaroxaban or apixaban was performed. RESULTS: Mean 
      inter-individual variability expressed as overall CV values for all drugs was 
      lower at peak (CV=46%) than at trough (CV=63%). Mean CV% intra-individual 
      variability was 36.6% at trough and 34.0% at peak. Correlation with CrCl was poor 
      for all drugs and only dabigatran at trough showed a significant correlation. 
      CONCLUSION: This multicenter study confirms high DOAC inter-individual 
      variability that cannot be explained by the rate of renal clearance to which the 
      three DOAC were subjected since the correlation with CrCl was relatively poor. 
      This poor correlation suggests caution in using CrCl as the sole laboratory 
      parameter to indirectly evaluate residual circulating DOAC.

AB  - We report a patient who presented a non-ST segment elevation myocardial 
      infarction in the context of severe normocytic hypochromic anemia related to 
      gastrointestinal bleeding, 3 months after switching anticoagulant from the 
      vitamin K antagonist acenocoumarol to the direct oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban. 
      High levels of both anti-Xa activity and rivaroxaban plasma concentrations were 
      measured despite rivaroxaban withdrawal, suggesting reduced elimination/drug 
      clearance. Estimated half-life was 2-3 times longer than usually reported. The 
      patient is a homozygous carrier of ABCB1 variant alleles, which could have 
      participated to reduced elimination of rivaroxaban. Furthermore, CYP3A4/5 
      phenotyping showed moderately reduced enzyme activity. Drug-drug interaction with 
      simvastatin may have contributed to decreased rivaroxaban elimination. Although 
      in the present case moderate acute renal failure probably played a role, more 
      clinical data are required to elucidate the impact of ABCB1 polymorphism on 
      rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and bleeding complications.

AB  - Prothrombin time (PT) has been widely used for measuring anticoagulation 
      intensity under rivaroxaban therapy, but precise information has not been well 
      established yet. Consecutive 96 non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) under 
      rivaroxaban between Jan/June, 2015 were recruited. Serum concentration (SC) and 
      PT with 5 representative reagents available in Japan (Neoplastin Plus®, 
      Thromborel S®, Thrombocheck PT®, Thrombocheck PT Plus®, and Recombiplastin®) at 
      2-4 hours after (peak) and before intake of rivaroxaban (trough) were measured at 
      outpatient clinic in the cardiovascular institute (CVI ARO study 1). Nonlinear 
      mixed-effects modelling was used to model the population pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban. An oral one-compartment model was employed to 
      describe the population pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. The pharmacokinetics of 
      rivaroxaban were affected by creatinine clearance, alanine aminotransferase, and 
      use of CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors. PTs with 5 reagents were predicted by 
      pharmacodinamic models with SC, hematocrit, serum albumin, and age, with medium 
      predicting ability (highest/lowest R2 = 0.746/0.658 in Recombiplastin/Thromborel 
      S, respectively). This population analysis in NVAF patients under rivaroxaban 
      therapy demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban was described by an 
      oral one-compartment model with expected covariates, and can be assessed by PT 
      with available reagents in Japan with medium predicting ability.

AB  - PURPOSE: Rivaroxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant with a large inter-individual 
      variability. The present study is to develop a physiologically based 
      pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict several scenarios in clinical practice. 
      METHODS: A whole-body PBPK model for rivaroxaban, which is metabolized by the 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5, 2J2 pathways and excreted via kidneys, was developed 
      to predict the pharmacokinetics at different doses in healthy subjects and 
      patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. Hepatic clearance and drug-drug 
      interactions (DDI) were estimated by in vitro in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) based 
      on parameters obtained from in vitro experiments. To validate the model, observed 
      concentrations were compared with predicted concentrations, and the impact of 
      special scenarios was investigated. RESULTS: The PBPK model successfully 
      predicted the pharmacokinetics for healthy subjects and patients as well as DDIs. 
      Sensitivity analysis shows that age, renal, and hepatic clearance are important 
      factors affecting rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics. The predicted fold increase of 
      rivaroxaban AUC values when combined administered with the inhibitors such as 
      ketoconazole, ritonavir, and clarithromycin were 2.3, 2.2, and 1.3, respectively. 
      When DDIs and hepatic dysfunction coexist, the fold increase of rivaroxaban 
      exposure would increase significantly compared with one factor alone. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study using PBPK modeling provided a reasonable approach to 
      evaluate exposure levels in special patients under special scenarios. Although 
      further clinical study or real-life experience would certainly merit the current 
      work, the modeling work so far would at least suggest caution of using 
      rivaroxaban in complicated clinical settings.

AB  - Rivaroxaban, an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor, is a small molecule drug 
      capable of inhibiting not only free factor Xa with high selectivity but also 
      prothrombinase-bound and clot-associated factor Xa in a concentration-dependent 
      manner. Clinical studies have demonstrated predictable anticoagulation and 
      confirmed dose-proportional effects for rivaroxaban in humans with a rapid onset 
      (within 2-4 h) and a half-life of 7-11 h and 11-13 h for young and elderly 
      subjects, respectively. For a 10 mg dose, the oral bioavailability of rivaroxaban 
      is high (80-100%) and is not affected by food intake. These favourable 
      pharmacological properties underpin the use of rivaroxaban in fixed dosing 
      regimens, with no need for dose adjustment or routine coagulation monitoring. 
      Rivaroxaban has a dual mode of excretion with the renal route accounting for 
      one-third of the overall elimination of unchanged active drug. Rivaroxaban is a 
      substrate of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein and therefore not recommended for 
      concomitant use with strong inhibitors of both pathways, e.g. most azole 
      antimycotics and protease inhibitors. Rivaroxaban is currently approved for the 
      prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adult patients undergoing elective 
      hip or knee replacement surgery. Studies using 10 mg rivaroxaban once daily in 
      this indication demonstrated its suitability for a wide range of patients 
      regardless of age, gender or body weight. Further studies in the treatment of 
      VTE, prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary 
      syndrome, prevention of stroke in those with atrial fibrillation and prevention 
      of VTE in hospitalized medically ill patients have been reported or are ongoing.

PG  - 981-90
AB  - Rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) is an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor in advanced 
      clinical development for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic 
      disorders. This was a randomized, 2-way crossover study in healthy male subjects, 
      with an aspirin run-in period, to examine whether aspirin influences the safety, 
      tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. All 
      treatments were well tolerated; drug-related adverse events were mild and 
      transient. Aspirin did not alter the effects of rivaroxaban on Factor Xa activity 
      or clotting tests. Platelet aggregation and bleeding time were not affected by 
      rivaroxaban, and rivaroxaban did not influence the effects of aspirin on these 
      parameters to a clinically relevant extent. Aspirin did not affect the 
      pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban, including the fraction unbound. This study 
      suggests that there is no clinically relevant interaction between rivaroxaban and 
      aspirin and that the 2 drugs could be administered concomitantly at the doses 
      used in this study.

TI  - Prevention and treatment of experimental thrombosis in rabbits with rivaroxaban 
      (BAY 597939)--an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor.
PG  - 471-7
AB  - Current anticoagulant therapies for the prevention and treatment of 
      thromboembolic disorders have many drawbacks: vitamin K antagonists interact with 
      food and drugs and require frequent laboratory monitoring, and heparins require 
      parenteral administration. Oral rivaroxaban (BAY 597939) is a new, highly 
      selective and potent direct factor-Xa (FXa) inhibitor with a predictable 
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile and could therefore be an attractive 
      antithrombotic drug. It was the objective of this study to investigate the 
      antithrombotic efficacy of oral rivaroxaban in two rabbit models of experimental 
      venous thrombosis. In the venous stasis (prevention) model, animals were 
      randomized to receive oral rivaroxaban 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 or 10.0 mg/kg or vehicle 
      control. Thrombosis was induced by jugular vein stasis and injection of 
      thromboplastin into the ear vein. In the venous thrombosis (treatment) model, 
      intravenous (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) and oral (3.0 mg/kg) rivaroxaban was compared 
      with intravenous nadroparin (40 U bolus and 20 U/h), fondaparinux (42 microg/kg) 
      and vehicle control. Thrombus growth was assessed by measuring the accretion of 
      radiolabelled fibrinogen into preformed clots in the jugular veins. Bleeding was 
      assessed using an ear bleeding model. In the prevention model, rivaroxaban 
      reduced thrombus formation dose-dependently (calculated ED(50) 1.3 mg/kg). In the 
      treatment model, oral rivaroxaban (3.0 mg/kg) reduced thrombus growth to a 
      similar extent to intravenous rivaroxaban (1.0 mg/kg), nadroparin and 
      fondaparinux. Oral rivaroxaban did not prolong bleeding time. In conclusion, the 
      orally available selective, direct FXa inhibitor rivaroxaban is effective in the 
      prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis in two well-established models of 
      experimental thrombosis.

TI  - Rivaroxaban: a new oral factor Xa inhibitor.
PG  - 376-81
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.202978 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is a direct inhibitor of factor Xa, a coagulation factor at a 
      critical juncture in the blood coagulation pathway leading to thrombin generation 
      and clot formation. It is selective for human factor Xa, for which it has >10 
      000-fold greater selectivity than for other biologically relevant serine 
      proteases (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC(50)], >20 micromol/L). 
      Rivaroxaban inhibits factor Xa in a concentration-dependent manner (inhibitory 
      constant [K(i)], 0.4 nmol/L) and binds rapidly (kinetic association rate constant 
      [k(on)], 1.7x10(7) mol/L(-1) s(-1)) and reversibly (kinetic dissociation rate 
      constant [k(off)], 5x10(-3) s(-1)). By inhibiting prothrombinase complex-bound 
      (IC(50), 2.1 nmol/L) and clot-associated factor Xa (IC(50), 75 nmol/L), 
      rivaroxaban reduces the thrombin burst during the propagation phase. In animal 
      models of venous and arterial thrombosis, rivaroxaban showed dose-dependent 
      antithrombotic activity. In healthy individuals, rivaroxaban was found to have 
      predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics across a 5- to 80-mg total 
      daily dose range, inhibiting factor Xa activity and prolonging plasma clotting 
      time. In phase III clinical trials, rivaroxaban regimens reduced rates of venous 
      thromboembolism in patients after total hip or knee arthroplasty compared with 
      enoxaparin regimens, without significant differences in rates of major bleeding, 
      showing that rivaroxaban has a favorable benefit-to-risk profile.

TI  - Effects of the oral, direct factor xa inhibitor rivaroxaban on platelet-induced 
      thrombin generation and prothrombinase activity.
PG  - 1398-407
AB  - Rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) is an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor in advanced 
      development. This study was undertaken to investigate its effects on thrombin 
      generation. In this placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study, 12 healthy 
      subjects received rivaroxaban (single 5- or 30-mg dose) or placebo. Thrombin 
      generation was investigated by measuring the endogenous thrombin potential and 
      prothrombinase-induced clotting time. Maximal effect of rivaroxaban was observed 
      2 hours after drug administration: prothrombinase-induced clotting time was 
      prolonged 1.8 and 2.3 times baseline after rivaroxaban 5 and 30 mg, respectively. 
      Collagen-induced endogenous thrombin potential was reduced by approximately 80% 
      and approximately 90% compared with baseline after rivaroxaban 5 and 30 mg, 
      respectively, and tissue factor-induced endogenous thrombin potential was reduced 
      by approximately 40% (5 mg) and approximately 65% (30 mg), respectively. Thrombin 
      generation remained inhibited for 24 hours. There was a close correlation between 
      plasma concentration of rivaroxaban and prolongation of prothrombinase-induced 
      clotting time and reduction in endogenous thrombin potential. Rivaroxaban 
      strongly inhibits platelet-induced thrombin generation, after activation of 
      either platelets or the coagulation pathway, even in the presence of minimal 
      factor Xa inhibition in plasma.

TI  - Model-based dose selection for phase III rivaroxaban study in Japanese patients 
      with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 59-70
AB  - The global ROCKET AF phase III trial evaluated rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily 
      (o.d.) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). Based on rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics in Japanese subjects and lower anticoagulation preferences in 
      Japan, particularly in elderly patients, the optimal dose regimen for Japanese AF 
      patients was considered. The aim of this analysis was dose selection for Japanese 
      patients from a pharmacokinetic aspect by comparison of simulated exposure in 
      Japanese patients with those in Caucasian patients. As a result of population 
      pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics analyses, a one-compartment pharmacokinetic 
      model with first-order absorption and direct link pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
      models optimally described the plasma concentration and pharmacodynamic models 
      (Factor Xa activity, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and 
      HepTest), which were also consistent with previous works. Steady-state 
      simulations indicated 15 mg rivaroxaban o.d. doses in Japanese patients with AF 
      would yield exposures comparable to the 20 mg o.d. dose in Caucasian patients 
      with AF. In conclusion, in the context of the lower anticoagulation targets in 
      Japanese practice, the population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling 
      supports 15 mg o.d. as the principal rivaroxaban dose in J-ROCKET AF.

AB  - Tedizolid (TDZ) is a novel oxazolidinone class antibiotic, indicated for the 
      treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections in adults. In 
      this study a highly sensitive UPLC-MS/MS assay was developed and validated for 
      the determination of TDZ in rat plasma using rivaroxaban as an internal standard 
      (IS). Both TDZ and IS were separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH™ C(18) column using 
      an isocratic mobile phase comprising of acetonitrile-20 mm ammonium acetate 
      (85:15, v/v), eluted at 0.3 mL/min flow rate. The plasma sample was processed by 
      liquid liquid extraction technique using ethyl acetate as an extracting agent. 
      The analyte and IS were detected in positive mode using electrospray ionization 
      source. The precursor to product ion transitions at m/z 371.09 > 343.10 for TDZ 
      and m/z 435.97 > 144.94 for IS were used for the quantification in multiple 
      reaction monitoring mode. The calibration curve was linear in the concentration 
      range of 0.74-1500 ng/mL and the lower limit of quantification was 0.74 ng/mL 
      only. The developed assay was validated following standard guidelines for 
      bioanalytical method validation (US Food and Drug Administration) and all the 
      validation results were within the acceptable limits. The developed assay was 
      successfully applied into a pharmacokinetic study in rats. Copyright © 2016 John

TI  - Risk Factors for Higher-than-Expected Residual Rivaroxaban Plasma Concentrations 
      in Real-Life Patients.
PG  - 808-817
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1639585 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rivaroxaban (RXA) is a direct oral factor Xa (Xa) antagonist with a 
      short half-life and a fast onset and offset of effect. Before elective surgery, 
      discontinuation is recommended with an interval of at least > 24 hours. In 
      clinical practice, this is, however, not always sufficient to achieve a residual 
      RXA plasma concentration deemed appropriate for surgery, defined as ≤ 50 mcg/L. 
      Our study aimed at identifying factors associated with a higher-than-expected 
      residual RXA plasma concentration in a large group of real-life patients. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective single-centre study included all 
      patients taking RXA between 2012 and 2016 where RXA plasma concentration was 
      determined by pharmacodynamic anti-Xa assay (518 measurements in 368 patients). 
      Medical records were reviewed. Residual RXA plasma concentrations were then 
      compared with expected values according to a pharmacokinetic model. RESULTS: 
      Residual RXA plasma concentration was significantly higher-than-expected in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation, impaired kidney function (glomerular 
      filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min), CYP3A4-, CYP2J2- and PGP-inhibitory 
      co-medication including amiodarone. Impaired kidney function (odds ratio [OR], 
      2.22, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-3.78, p = 0.003) and concomitant 
      amiodarone intake (OR, 1.97, 95% CI, 1.04-3.72, p = 0.036) were significantly 
      associated with RXA plasma concentrations > 50 mcg/L at 24 to 48 hours after the 
      last RXA intake. CONCLUSION: In our group of real-life patients, impaired kidney 
      function (GFR < 60 mL/min) and co-medication with amiodarone were independently 
      associated with higher-than-expected residual RXA plasma concentrations. In these 
      patients, standard intervals of RXA discontinuation may not always be sufficient 
      before elective surgery and routine pre-operative determination of the residual 
      RXA concentration could be advisable.

AB  - Rivaroxaban exposure and patient characteristics may affect the rivaroxaban 
      benefit-risk balance. This study aimed to quantify associations between 
      model-predicted rivaroxaban exposure and patient characteristics and efficacy and 
      safety outcomes in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), using 
      data from the phase 3 ROCKET AF trial (NCT00403767). In ROCKET AF, 14,264 
      patients with NVAF were randomized to rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily [OD], or 
      15 mg OD if creatinine clearance was 30-49 mL/min) or dose-adjusted warfarin 
      (median follow-up: 707 days); rivaroxaban plasma concentration was measured in a 
      subset of 161 patients. In this post hoc exposure-response analysis, a 
      multivariate Cox model was used to correlate individual predicted rivaroxaban 
      exposures and patient characteristics with time-to-event efficacy and safety 
      outcomes in 7061 and 7111 patients, respectively. There was no significant 
      association between model-predicted rivaroxaban trough plasma concentration 
      (C(trough)) and efficacy outcomes. Creatinine clearance and history of stroke 
      were significantly associated with efficacy outcomes. C(trough) was significantly 
      associated with the composite of major or non-major clinically relevant (NMCR) 
      bleeding (hazard ratio [95th percentile vs. median]: 1.26 [95% confidence 
      interval 1.13-1.40]) but not with major bleeding alone. The exposure-response 
      relationship for major or NMCR bleeding was shallow with no clear threshold for 
      an acceleration in risk. History of gastrointestinal bleeding had a greater 
      influence on safety outcomes than C(trough). These results support fixed 
      rivaroxaban 15 mg and 20 mg OD dosages in NVAF. Therapeutic drug monitoring is 
      unlikely to offer clinical benefits in this indication beyond evaluation of 
      patient characteristics.

TI  - Inhibitory effect of apixaban compared with rivaroxaban and dabigatran on 
      thrombin generation assay.
PG  - 19-25
LID - 10.3810/hp.2013.02.1009 [doi]
AB  - The effect of the oral direct activated factor X (factor Xa) inhibitor apixaban 
      on tissue factor-induced thrombin generation in human plasma was investigated in 
      vitro using the calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT) method and compared with 
      the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban and the direct thrombin inhibitor 
      dabigatran. Pooled citrated, anticoagulated, platelet-poor human plasma was 
      spiked with apixaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran at concentrations of 0.01 to 10 
      μM. The inhibitory potencies of the compounds were quantified by 5 CAT 
      parameters: the control thrombin lag time (LT) and time to thrombin peak (TTP) 
      for the doubling of inhibitor concentration (IC2x); and the control endogenous 
      thrombin potential (ETP), thrombin peak, and maximum rate of thrombin generation 
      (Vmax) for the inhibitor concentration, which inhibited 50% (IC50). The 
      inhibitors modified CAT concentration dependently. Their inhibitory potencies, 
      expressed as IC2x LT, IC2x TTP, IC50 ETP, IC50 peak thrombin, and IC50 Vmax, were 
      as follows: 0.10 ± 0.01, 0.19 ± 0.02, 0.65 ± 0.11, 0.089 ± 0.019, and 0.049 ± 
      0.007 μM for apixaban; 0.049 ± 0.007, 0.070 ± 0.009, 0.43 ± 0.07, 0.048 ± 0.008, 
      and 0.022 ± 0.005 μM for rivaroxaban; and 0.063 ± 0.019, 0.18 ± 0.06, 0.50 ± 
      0.08, 0.55 ± 0.06, and 0.57 ± 0.27 μM for dabigatran. In summary, apixaban, 
      rivaroxaban, and dabigatran have similar potencies in the prolongation of LT and 
      TTP. The CAT parameters that are related to the rate of thrombin generation 
      during the propagation phase (ie, peak thrombin and Vmax) are more sensitive to 
      activities of apixaban and rivaroxaban than dabigatran. The ETP is the least 
      sensitive parameter for measuring the activities of these inhibitors. Recombinant 
      activated factor VII at 5 and 50 μg/mL reversed the anticoagulant effects of 
      apixaban more at 0.2 μM than at 2 μM. Our study suggests that the CAT method is a 
      sensitive assay to monitor the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of 
      apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran, and may provide insight into the mechanism 
      of action of these inhibitors. Recombinant activated factor VII may have some 
      potential to reverse the anticoagulant effects of apixaban in vitro.

TI  - Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modelling to Identify Pharmacokinetic 
      Parameters Driving Drug Exposure Changes in the Elderly.
PG  - 383-401
LID - 10.1007/s40262-019-00822-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication use is highly prevalent with advanced age, but clinical 
      studies are rarely conducted in the elderly, leading to limited knowledge 
      regarding age-related pharmacokinetic changes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this 
      study was to investigate which pharmacokinetic parameters determine drug exposure 
      changes in the elderly by conducting virtual clinical trials for ten drugs 
      (midazolam, metoprolol, lisinopril, amlodipine, rivaroxaban, repaglinide, 
      atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, clarithromycin and rifampicin) using our 
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) framework. METHODS: PBPK models for 
      all ten drugs were developed in young adults (20-50 years) following the best 
      practice approach, before predicting pharmacokinetics in the elderly (≥ 65 years) 
      without any modification of drug parameters. A descriptive relationship between 
      age and each investigated pharmacokinetic parameter (peak concentration [C(max)], 
      time to C(max) [t(max)], area under the curve [AUC], clearance, volume of 
      distribution, elimination-half-life) was derived using the final PBPK models, and 
      verified with independent clinically observed data from 52 drugs. RESULTS: The 
      age-related changes in drug exposure were successfully simulated for all ten 
      drugs. Pharmacokinetic parameters were predicted within 1.25-fold (70%), 1.5-fold 
      (86%) and 2-fold (100%) of clinical data. AUC increased progressively by 0.9% per 
      year throughout adulthood from the age of 20 years, which was explained by 
      decreased clearance, while C(max), t(max) and volume of distribution were not 
      affected by human aging. Additional clinical data of 52 drugs were contained 
      within the estimated variability of the established age-dependent correlations 
      for each pharmacokinetic parameter. CONCLUSION: The progressive decrease in 
      hepatic and renal blood flow, as well as glomerular filtration, rate led to a 
      reduced clearance driving exposure changes in the healthy elderly, independent of 
      the drug.

TI  - Rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939)--an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor--has no clinically 
      relevant interaction with naproxen.
PG  - 469-76
AB  - AIMS: Rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) is in advanced clinical development for the 
      prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. Frequent co-medications in 
      the patient populations likely to receive rivaroxaban include NSAIDs. This 
      randomized, two-way crossover study, with a naproxen run-in period, was performed 
      to determine whether naproxen influences the tolerability, pharmacodynamics and 
      pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. METHODS: Eleven healthy, young males received 
      naproxen 500 mg on two consecutive days, a single dose of rivaroxaban 15 mg, or 
      both. RESULTS: Treatments were well tolerated: adverse events (eight in total), 
      reported by three subjects, were mild and not drug related. Rivaroxaban inhibited 
      Factor Xa activity by 35% and prolonged prothrombin time [by 1.4 times baseline 
      (tb)], activated partial thromboplastin time (1.3 tb) and the HepTest (1.9 tb). 
      Naproxen had no influence on these measures and the combination of rivaroxaban 
      and naproxen did not affect platelet aggregation. Rivaroxaban and naproxen given 
      together significantly increased bleeding time compared with rivaroxaban alone (P 
      = 0.017). However, this difference was small compared with the effect of naproxen 
      given alone, except in one subject. Least squares-means ratios for the AUC and 
      C(max) of rivaroxaban after administration alone and with naproxen were 1.125 
      [90% confidence interval (CI) 0.995, 1.271] and 1.095 (90% CI 0.905, 1.325), 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There appeared to be no clinically relevant 
      interaction between rivaroxaban and naproxen in healthy subjects, although some 
      individuals may be more sensitive to the combination. Large-scale Phase III 
      clinical studies will be required to confirm whether there is an increased risk 
      of bleeding during treatment with rivaroxaban and concomitant NSAIDs.

AB  - For the past five decades, there has been little progress in the development of 
      oral anticoagulants, with the choices being limited to the vitamin K antagonists 
      (VKAs). The situation is changing with the development of orally active small 
      molecules that directly target thrombin or activated factor X (FXa). The two 
      agents in the most advanced stages of development are dabigatran etexilate and 
      rivaroxaban, which inhibit thrombin and FXa, respectively. Both are approved in 
      the EU and Canada for venous thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing elective 
      hip- or knee-replacement surgery. Other agents in the early stages of development 
      include several FXa inhibitors (apixaban, DU 176b, LY 517717, YM 150, betrixaban, 
      eribaxaban [PD 0348292] and TAK 442) and one thrombin inhibitor (AZD 0837). With 
      a predictable anticoagulant response and low potential for drug-drug 
      interactions, these new agents can be given in fixed doses without coagulation 
      monitoring. This renders them more convenient than VKAs. While the anticoagulant 
      effect of the new thrombin and FXa inhibitors is similar, differences in the 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters may influence their use in 
      clinical practice. Here, we compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      features of these new oral agents.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are substrates for the ABCB1 transporter (also 
      called P-glycoprotein), an active efflux pump. ABCB1 polymorphisms have been 
      previously reported to influence the pharmacokinetics of several drugs such as 
      immunosuppressants and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Recently, in vivo studies have 
      suggested that genetic variants might contribute to the inter-individual 
      variability in DOAC plasma concentrations. Therefore, we evaluated the in vitro 
      effect of the most common coding ABCB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), 
      1236 C > T-2677G > T-3435C > T, and the coding ABCB1 1199 G > A SNP on the 
      transport activity towards rivaroxaban. HEK293 cells were transfected to 
      overexpress the ABCB1 wild-type (1236C-2677G-3435C, 1199 G) or variant proteins 
      (1236C-2677G-3435T, 1236T-2677T-3435T or 1199 A). ABCB1 expression decreased the 
      intracellular accumulation of rivaroxaban, when compared to control cells. This 
      confirms the involvement of ABCB1 in the active transport of rivaroxaban. 
      However, the ABCB1 1236 C > T-2677G > T-3435C > T and 1199 G > A SNPs had no 
      significant influence on the intracellular accumulation of rivaroxaban when 
      compared to the wild-type protein. These results suggest that the ABCB1 coding 
      SNPs investigated in the present study are unlikely to contribute to the 
      inter-individual variability in rivaroxaban plasma concentrations.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is increasingly used to treat patients with acute venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE), a potentially life-threatening condition. Because 
      absorption of rivaroxaban decreases from nearly 100% to 66% under fasting 
      conditions, it is recommended that VTE patients take rivaroxaban with a meal. 
      However, this recommendation is based on preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies 
      in healthy volunteers. So far, no clinical evidence is available to support this 
      recommendation. We describe a case of a compliant young patient who developed 
      recurrent pulmonary embolism during rivaroxaban treatment. PK studies provided 
      evidence that malabsorption of rivaroxaban 20 mg due to irregular intake of meals 
      during shift work was the leading cause of recurrent pulmonary embolism. When the 
      patient was instructed to take rivaroxaban with a regular meal, peak plasma 
      concentrations increased from 115 to 318 ng mL(-1) (+ 176%). Consequently, the 
      importance of taking rivaroxaban with food may have a greater clinical relevance 
      than data from preclinical PK studies suggest.

TI  - Impact of gene polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters on 
      trough concentrations of rivaroxaban in patients with atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 297-304
LID - 10.1111/bcpt.13488 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is excreted from the body via multiple pathways involving glomerular 
      filtration, drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. In this study, we aimed 
      to examine the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms in P-glycoprotein, 
      breast cancer resistance protein, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 and CYP2J2 on the 
      pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. Eighty-six patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF) undergoing AF catheter ablation were enrolled in this study. 
      In these analyses, the dose-adjusted plasma trough concentration ratio (C(0h) /D) 
      of rivaroxaban was used as the pharmacokinetic index. The median (quartile range) 
      rivaroxaban C(0h) /D was 3.39 (2.08-5.21) ng/mL/mg (coefficient of variation: 
      80.5%). The C(0h) /D did not differ significantly among ABCB1 c.3435C>T, 
      c.2677G>A/T, c.1236C>T, ABCG2 c.421C>A, CYP3A5*3 and CYP2J2*7 genotypes. Stepwise 
      selection multiple linear regression analysis showed that the estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate was the only independent factor influencing the C(0h) 
      /D of rivaroxaban (R(2)  = 0.152, P < 0.001). There was a significant correlation 
      between the C(0h) of rivaroxaban and prothrombin time (PT) (rho = 0.357, P = 
      0.001). In patients with NVAF, pharmacokinetic genotype tests are unlikely to be 
      useful for prediction of the C(0h) of rivaroxaban.

TI  - New compounds in the management of venous thromboembolism after orthopedic 
      surgery: focus on rivaroxaban.
PG  - 855-62
AB  - Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is a member of a new class of oral, direct 
      (antithrombin-independent) factor Xa inhibitors, which restrict thrombin 
      generation both in vitro and in vivo. After oral administration the absorption is 
      near 100%, the bioavailability is near 80%, and the elimination half-life is 5-9 
      hours with mixed excretion via the renal and fecal/biliary routes. The 
      pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban are predictable and consistent with a rapid onset 
      of antithrombotic action within 2 hours after administration. Phase II clinical 
      studies have been carried out in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) 
      or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and a dose of 10 mg once daily for 
      thromboprophylaxis was selected for further clinical development. The results of 
      the phase III studies showed a significantly better antithrombotic efficacy of 
      rivaroxaban compared with enoxaparin both in the short term (10-14 days) in TKA 
      patients and long term (35 +/- 4 days) in THA patients with a comparable safety. 
      Symptomatic thromboembolic events were also significantly reduced with 
      rivaroxaban. Liver enzyme elevation was seen in patients treated with 
      rivaroxaban, but there was no indication of an increased risk of liver toxicity 
      compared with enoxaparin. In conclusion, rivaroxaban is a potent and safe new 
      compound for antithrombotic prophylaxis in orthopedic surgery.

AB  - Amongst numerous promising anticoagulant molecules, rivaroxaban (Xarelto(®)), 
      dabigatran (Pradaxa(®)) and apixaban (Eliquis(®)) have been registered outside 
      the USA in the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients undergoing total 
      hip or knee prosthetic replacement. Rivaroxaban however has been granted 
      authorisation by the FDA for the thromboprophylaxis after surgery for total hip 
      or knee surgery. Dabigatran has been granted authorisation by the FDA in 
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (RE-LY trial) while rivaroxaban is expecting 
      approval in this same indication (ROCKET trial). Phase III results in the 
      treatment and in the secondary prevention of established venous thrombosis and 
      pulmonary embolism are encouraging. These small molecules are obtained by 
      chemical synthesis, their molecular weight is lower than 500 daltons. Many 
      coagulation tests may be affected by these molecules. Those modifications should 
      be known in order to avoid misinterpretation of the tests but could also be used 
      to measure plasma concentrations of these products. The choice of a non specific 
      global and readily available test has been documented (Quick time for rivaroxaban 
      and aPTT for dabigatran). Anti-Xa (for rivaroxaban) and anti-IIa (for dabigatran) 
      activities should however be preferred, expressed in ng/ml with calibrated 
      plasmas (containing predetermined concentration of the tested drug). The 
      half-life is around 8 to 12 hours, with a peak activity 2 to 4 hours after 
      ingestion. Dabigatran is mainly eliminated via the kidney, hence requiring 
      dose-adjustment in case of moderate renal insufficiency, and contra-indicated in 
      case of severe renal insufficiency. Rivaroxaban being excreted via kidney and 
      liver, some precautions should apply in case of liver insufficiency. No data are 
      available in pregnancy or pediatrics, clinical trials are ongoing. There are few 
      interactions with concomitant drugs, which should not be ignored. The short 
      half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote 
      in many instances. Their oral administration, without the need for dose 
      adjustment, and without requirement for a laboratory monitoring will increase 
      their use in a large number of patients, in those indications for which an 
      approval has been granted by health authorities.

AB  - To establish a rapid and sensitive ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem 
      mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination of rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban and edoxaban in rat plasma. The analytes and the internal standard 
      (diazepam) were separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 chromatography column 
      (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) using gradient elution with a mobile phase of 
      acetonitrile and 0.1 % formic acid in water at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The 
      detection was performed on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer by 
      multiple reaction monitoring mode to monitor the precursor-to-product ion 
      transitions of m/z 436.1 → 145.1 for rivaroxaban, m/z 460.0 → 443.1 for apixaban, 
      m/z 548.2 → 366.1 for edoxaban and m/z 285.2 → 193.1 for diazepam (IS) using a 
      positive electrospray ionization interface. The method was validated over a 
      concentration range of 1.0-200 ng/mL for rivaroxaban, 1.0-100 ng/mL for apixaban 
      and 1.0-500 ng/mL for edoxaban. Total time for each chromatograph was 3.5 min. 
      The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy of the quality control samples at 
      low, medium, and high concentration levels exhibited relative standard deviations 
      <10.5 % and the accuracy values ranged from -9.9 to 11.3 %. The method was 
      successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban in rats.

AB  - Many patients under oral anticoagulation therapy need percutaneous or surgical 
      interventions/operations. For vitamin K antagonists (VKA), there are 
      recommendations regarding preoperative or postoperative administration. 
      Management of the new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) was supposed to be easier - but 
      some aspects must be considered. Due to the different pharmacokinetic profiles of 
      substances such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, different 
      recommendations are given.Upon periprocedural management, thromboembolic risk has 
      to be considered in patients treated with NOACs. NOACS have a pharmacokinetic 
      advantage in terms of a rapid onset and rapid elimination via the liver and 
      kidneys. Impaired renal function results in extended half-life of NOACs 
      considerably.Surgical procedures under NOACS can be scheduled at the beginning of 
      next dosing interval or omitted in low/minimal bleeding risk patients, so that 
      only 2-3 NOAC doses are not administered. In patients with moderate and high risk 
      of bleeding, there should be a NOAC break of 24-48 h prior to surgery in order to 
      allow a corresponding decay of the active metabolite. In patients with 
      low/intermediate risk for thromboembolism, no bridging is necessary if the 
      "unprotected" time (NOAC break) is less than 4-5-(7) days. In patients at high 
      risk of thromboembolism, individual consideration must be taken regarding 
      bridging or extended NOAC break. Whether NOACs can be dispensed or bridging is 
      necessary in these patients must be clarified in randomized trials for 
      periprocedural management of NOACs patients.

TI  - Prediction of Rivaroxaban-Rifampin Interaction After Major Orthopedic Surgery: 
      Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling and Simulation.
PG  - 706781

AB  - Rivaroxaban is commonly used for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
      for patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. Rivaroxaban is primarily 
      eliminated by hepatic CYP450 metabolism and renal excretion. Rifampin is a 
      commonly used antibiotic for prosthetic joint infections (PJI) and a potent 
      inducer of CYP450 enzymes. Clinical data about drug-drug interactions of 
      rivaroxaban and rifampin are limited. The present study is to describe DDI of 
      rivaroxaban and rifampin in several prosthetic joint infections patients 
      undergoing major orthopedic surgery. We retrospectively identified six patients 
      concomitantly administered with rivaroxaban and rifampin between 2019 and 2020. 
      Plasma samples of these patients with accurate sampling time were chosen from the 
      biobank and plasma levels of rivaroxaban were measured at each time point. A 
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for the rivaroxaban-rifampin 
      interaction was developed to predict the optimal dosing regimen of rivaroxaban in 
      the case of co-medication with rifampin. The model was validated by the observed 
      plasma concentration of rivaroxaban from the above patients. From this model, it 
      could be simulated that when rifampin starts or stops, gradually changing 
      rivaroxaban dose during the first few days would elevate the efficacy and safety 
      of rivaroxaban.

TI  - Confirmation of model-based dose selection for a Japanese phase III study of 
      rivaroxaban in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients.
PG  - 321-31
AB  - This study was designed to confirm the appropriateness of the dose setting for a 
      Japanese phase III study of rivaroxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF), which had been based on model simulation employing phase II 
      study data. The previously developed mixed-effects 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model, which consisted of an oral 
      one-compartment model parameterized in terms of clearance, volume and a 
      first-order absorption rate, was rebuilt and optimized using the data for 597 
      subjects from the Japanese phase III study, J-ROCKET AF. A mixed-effects modeling 
      technique in NONMEM was used to quantify both unexplained inter-individual 
      variability and inter-occasion variability, which are random effect parameters. 
      The final PK and PK-PD models were evaluated to identify influential covariates. 
      The empirical Bayes estimates of AUC and C(max) from the final PK model were 
      consistent with the simulated results from the Japanese phase II study. There was 
      no clear relationship between individual estimated exposures and safety-related 
      events, and the estimated exposure levels were consistent with the global phase 
      III data. Therefore, it was concluded that the dose selected for the phase III 
      study with Japanese NVAF patients by means of model simulation employing phase II 
      study data had been appropriate from the PK-PD perspective.

AB  - The anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban, a direct inhibitor of activated factor X 
      (FX), might be influenced by its dosing time because the activity of the 
      coagulofibrinolytic system exhibits daily rhythmicity. In rats, FX activity 
      follows a 24-h rhythm with a peak in the middle of the light phase and a trough 
      at the beginning of the dark phase. Consistent with these findings, a single dose 
      of rivaroxaban had a stronger inhibitory effect on FX activity after dosing at 
      the beginning of the light phase than after dosing at the beginning of the dark 
      phase. A similar chronopharmacological effect was seen in a quantitative model of 
      venous stasis thrombosis. In comparison, the dosing time had minimal influence on 
      the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. These data indicate that the anticoagulant 
      effect of rivaroxaban is influenced by the dosing time. Further studies should 
      confirm this finding in a clinical setting.

TI  - An in vitro study to investigate the interference of enoxaparin on plasma levels 
      of direct oral factor Xa inhibitors measured by chromogenic assays.
PG  - 309-315
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.12974 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Co-administration of enoxaparin and a direct oral factor Xa 
      inhibitor (xabans: apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) could give rise to the 
      problem of overlapping the anti-Xa activity when measuring direct oral 
      anticoagulant (DOAC) levels. We aimed to evaluate in vitro the degree of the 
      interference of increasing enoxaparin concentrations on xaban plasma levels 
      measured by different chromogenic anti-Xa assays with drug-specific calibrators 
      and controls. METHODS: Seven plasma samples were spiked with apixaban, edoxaban, 
      or rivaroxaban at fixed concentration, and enoxaparin at increasing 
      concentrations (0, 0.125, 0.250, 0.50, 1.0, 1.50, and 2.0 IU/mL). The evaluated 
      chromogenic assays were as follows: Biophen DiXaI and Biophen Heparin LRT (Hyphen 
      BioMed), Berichrom Heparin and Innovance Heparin (Siemens), STA-Liquid Anti-Xa 
      (Stago Diagnostics), Technochrom anti-Xa (Technoclone), and HemosIL Liquid 
      Anti-Xa (Werfen). RESULTS: The presence of enoxaparin caused increased DOAC 
      levels, with over-estimation depending on the anti-Xa assay and on the heparin 
      concentration in the sample. The smallest over-estimation was in the sample with 
      enoxaparin 0.125 IU/mL and the greatest in the sample with enoxaparin 2.0 IU/mL 
      (0%, 3.1%, and 7.4% vs 583.8%, 526.1%, and 415.2% for apixaban, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban, respectively). Biophen DiXaI showed lower interference compared to 
      other methods (maximum over-estimation in the presence of enoxaparin 2.0 IU/mL: 
      56.4% dosing rivaroxaban by Biophen DIXaI vs 583.8% dosing apixaban by Berichrom 
      Heparin). CONCLUSION: The presence of enoxaparin interferes with xabans 
      measurement by chromogenic anti-Xa assays causing falsely elevated DOAC levels, 
      the over-estimation being dependent on the anti-Xa assay and on the heparin 
      concentration in the sample.

TI  - Simultaneous Determination of Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, and Apixaban in Human 
      Plasma by Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry.
PG  - 473-480

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacokinetic studies and therapeutic drug monitoring of 
      anticoagulants require a simple, rapid, and reliable analytical method for 
      monitoring plasma concentrations. The aims of the current work were to develop 
      and validate a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method for the 
      simultaneous determination of 3 direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, and apixaban) in human plasma that is suitable for pharmacokinetic 
      studies and routine therapeutic drug monitoring in busy hospital laboratories. 
      METHODS: This method included a hydrolysis step to account for the active 
      acylglucuronide metabolites of dabigatran that demonstrate an equivalent 
      anticoagulant effect as dabigatran. After hydrolysis, a simple one-step protein 
      precipitation was used for sample preparation. Total dabigatran (the sum of free 
      dabigatran and the contribution from dabigatran acylglucuronides), rivaroxaban, 
      and apixaban, and their corresponding isotopically labeled internal standards 
      were resolved on a C18(2) column. All compounds were detected using electrospray 
      ionization liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry in the positive mode. 
      RESULTS: For all 3 anticoagulants, standard curves were linear over the 
      concentration range of 1.0-1000 mcg/L (r > 0.99), bias was < ±10%, and intraday 
      and interday coefficients of variation (imprecision) were <10%. The limit of 
      quantification was 1.0 mcg/L. For all 3 anticoagulants and corresponding 
      isotopically labeled internal standards, the absolute recoveries were similar and 
      consistent, with mean values of 93%-102%. No significant matrix effects were 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: This method is simple, rapid, robust, and reliable and can 
      be used to analyze the plasma concentrations of the drugs in patients on 
      dabigatran or rivaroxaban therapy.

AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in acute medically ill patients is a leading cause 
      of in-hospital morbidity and mortality. A majority of these VTE events occur 
      post-discharge, and patients remain at increased VTE risk for up to 3 months 
      post-discharge. Recent clinical trials of extended-duration thromboprophylaxis 
      with enoxaparin, rivaroxaban, and apixaban in acute medically ill patients did 
      not demonstrate a net clinical benefit compared with in-hospital 
      thromboprophylaxis, and were shown to be associated with higher risks of major 
      bleeding. Betrixaban is a new direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) with a different 
      pharmacokinetic profile than other DOACs. Betrixaban has the longest half-life 
      among the DOAC class, with a terminal half-life of 35-45 h and an effective 
      half-life of 19-27 h. Betrixaban has a low peak-to-trough ratio compared with 
      other anticoagulants and a predictable duration of drug exposure, leading to 
      overall consistent anticoagulant effect over 24 h. Betrixaban is mainly cleared 
      via the hepatobiliary system and therefore not contraindicated in patients with 
      severe renal insufficiency. Betrixaban was recently approved for the indication 
      of extended thromboprophylaxis in the United States based on the APEX trial of 
      betrixaban 80 mg once daily for 35-42 days compared with low molecular weight 
      heparin enoxaparin for 10 ± 4 days in hospitalized acute medically ill patients. 
      This study demonstrated that extended-duration betrixaban reduced VTE compared 
      with standard-duration enoxaparin in acute medically ill patients, without 
      increased risk of major bleeding. This patient population at risk of VTE may 
      benefit from extended prophylaxis, ensuring continuum of care from in-hospital to 
      post-discharge.

TI  - Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling for the Prediction of a Drug-Drug 
      Interaction of Combined Effects on P-glycoprotein and Cytochrome P450 3A.
PG  - 659-669
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12562 [doi]
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants, such as apixaban and rivaroxaban, are important for 
      the treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism and to reduce the risk of 
      stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. 
      Because apixaban and rivaroxaban are predominantly eliminated by cytochrome P450 
      (CYP) 3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), concomitant use of combined P-gp and strong 
      CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers should be avoided. Physiologically-based 
      pharmacokinetic models for apixaban and rivaroxaban were developed to estimate 
      the net effect of CYP3A induction, P-gp inhibition, and P-gp induction by 
      rifampicin. The disposition of rivaroxaban is more complex compared with apixaban 
      because both hepatic and renal P-gp is considered to contribute to rivaroxaban 
      elimination. Furthermore, organic anion transporter-3, a renal uptake 
      transporter, may also contribute the elimination of rivaroxaban from systemic 
      circulation. The models were verified with observed clinical drug-drug 
      interactions with CYP3A and P-gp inhibitors. With the developed models, the 
      predicted area under the concentration time curve and maximum concentration 
      ratios were 0.43 and 0.48, respectively, for apixaban, and 0.50-0.52 and 
      0.72-0.73, respectively, for rivaroxaban when coadministered with 600 mg multiple 
      doses of rifampicin and that were very close to observed data. The impact of each 
      of the elimination pathways was assessed for rivaroxaban, and inhibition of CYP3A 
      led to a larger impact over intestinal and hepatic P-gp. Inhibition of renal 
      organic anion transporter-3 or P-gp led to an overall modest interaction. The 
      developed apixaban and rivaroxaban models can be further applied to the 
      investigation of interactions with other P-gp and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors and 
      inducers.

AB  - As limited amounts of data are available regarding thrombolytic therapy for 
      patients taking novel oral anticoagulants, thrombolytic therapy is not 
      recommended in such cases. Here, we report an acute stroke patient taking 
      rivaroxaban who received intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue 
      plasminogen activator (rt-PA). An 80-year-old man with a history of nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation, who had been receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban showed abrupt 
      onset of aphasia and right hemiparesis. National Institutes of Health Stroke 
      Scale score was 10. Onset of neurologic deficits occurred 4 hours after the last 
      dose of rivaroxaban. Clinical data on admission were as follows: blood pressure, 
      170/90 mm Hg; prothrombin time (PT), 22.6 seconds (control, 12.9 seconds); 
      international normalized ratio, 2.03; activated partial thromboplastin time, 46 
      seconds (normal, 23-32 seconds); and creatinine level, 1.11 mg/dL. Magnetic 
      resonance angiography revealed occlusion of the superior trunk of the left middle 
      cerebral artery. Intravenous infusion of .6 mg/kg of rt-PA (total dose, 36 mg) 
      was performed 6 hours after the last rivaroxaban administration with informed 
      consent. The neurologic deficit improved during infusion of rt-PA. Repeat brain 
      computed tomography showed left frontal cortical infarction without hemorrhagic 
      changes. In the case of rivaroxaban, it is difficult to accurately determine the 
      drug activity. As the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban can be estimated from 
      its pharmacokinetics and PT, it is clinically important to obtain accurate 
      information about the timing of medication and blood sampling.

TI  - Absence of both MDR1 (ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2) 
      transporters significantly alters rivaroxaban disposition and central nervous 
      system entry.
PG  - 164-70
LID - 10.1111/bcpt.12005 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is a novel factor 10a inhibitor, where hepatic metabolism and renal 
      clearance account for its overall disposition. Renal impairment is known to 
      increase rivaroxaban-associated bleeding risk in patients. As renal rivaroxaban 
      clearance exceeds glomerular filtration rate, we suggested that active secretion 
      by efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (MDR1) and breast cancer resistance protein 
      (BCRP) contributes to rivaroxaban clearance. The ability of MDR1 and BCRP efflux 
      transporters to mediate rivaroxaban transport in vitro was assessed in polarized 
      cell monolayers. A significantly greater vectorial transport of rivaroxaban was 
      observed in the basal to apical direction in Caco-2 cells, which was attenuated 
      in the presence of the selective inhibitors. After oral administration of 
      rivaroxaban (2 mg/kg), plasma concentrations did not significantly differ between 
      wild-type and Mdr1a(def) or Bcrp(-/-) mice (n = 6 per group). However, 
      rivaroxaban clearance was significantly reduced in Mdr1a/Mdr1b(-/-)/Bcrp(-/-) 
      mice. Interestingly, rivaroxaban brain-to-plasma ratio did not differ in mice 
      lacking only Mdr1a or Bcrp, but more than two times higher in the 
      Mdr1a/Mdr1b(-/-)/Bcrp(-/-) mice. Rivaroxaban is a shared substrate of MDR1 and 
      BCRP. In vivo, MDR and BCRP function synergistically to modulate rivaroxaban 
      disposition and appear to be particularly relevant to limiting its central 
      nervous system entry. These data have important implications for safety and 
      efficacy of anticoagulation therapy with rivaroxaban as many drugs in clinical 
      use are known MDR1 inhibitors and loss-of-function polymorphisms in BCRP are 
      common.

TI  - Muscle Mass and Direct Oral Anticoagulant Activity in Older Adults With Atrial 
      Fibrillation.
PG  - 1012-1018
LID - 10.1111/jgs.16992 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are hydrophilic drugs with plasma 
      levels inversely proportional to lean body mass. Sarcopenic patients with low 
      muscle mass may be at risk for supra-therapeutic DOAC levels and bleeding 
      complications. We therefore sought to examine the influence of lean body mass on 
      DOAC levels in older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: A prospective 
      cohort study was conducted with patients 65 years of age or more receiving 
      rivaroxaban or apixaban for AF. Appendicular lean mass (ALM) was measured using a 
      bioimpedance device and a dual X-ray absorptiometry scanner. DOAC levels were 
      measured using a standardized anti-Xa assay 4 hours after (peak) and 1 hour 
      before (trough) ingestion. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 62 patients (47% 
      female, 77.0 ± 6.1 years). The prescribed DOACs were apixaban 2.5 mg (21%), 
      apixaban 5 mg (53%), and rivaroxaban 20 mg (26%). Overall, 16% had 
      supra-therapeutic DOAC levels at trough and 25% at peak. In the multivariable 
      logistic regression model, lower ALM was independently associated with 
      supra-therapeutic DOAC levels at trough (odds ratio per ↓ 1-kg 1.23, 95% 
      confidence interval 1.02 to 1.49) and peak (odds ratio per ↓ 1-kg 1.18, 95% 
      confidence interval 1.02 to 1.37). Addition of ALM to a model consisting of age, 
      total body weight, and renal function resulted in improved discrimination for 
      supra-therapeutic DOAC levels. CONCLUSION: Our proof-of-concept study has 
      identified an association between ALM and DOAC levels in older adults with AF. 
      Further research is needed to determine the impact of ALM on bleeding 
      complications and the potential role of ALM-guided dosing for sarcopenic 
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban is a direct inhibitor of coagulation factor Xa and is 
      used for venous thromboembolic disorders. The rivaroxaban interaction with BSA 
      was studied to understand its PK and PD (pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetics) 
      properties. Multi-spectroscopic studies were used to study the interaction which 
      included UV spectrophotometric, spectrofluorometric and three dimensional 
      spectrofluorometric studies. Further elucidation of data was done by molecular 
      simulation studies to evaluate the interaction behavior between BSA and 
      rivaroxaban. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban quenched the basic fluorescence of BSA molecule 
      by the process of static quenching since rivaroxaban and BSA form a complex that 
      results in shift of the absorption spectra of BSA molecule. A decline in the 
      values of binding constants was detected with the increase of temperatures 
      (298-308 K) and the binding constants were in range from 1.32 × 10(5) to 
      4.3 × 10(3) L mol(-1) indicating the instability of the BSA and rivaroxaban 
      complex at higher temperatures. The data of number of binding sites showed 
      uniformity. The site marker experiments indicated site I (sub-domain IIA) as the 
      principal site for rivaroxaban binding. The thermodynamic study experiments were 
      carried at the temperatures of 298/303/308 K. The ∆G(0), ∆H(0) and ∆S(0) at these 
      temperatures ranged between - 24.67 and - 21.27 kJ mol(-1) and the values for 
      ∆H(0) and ∆S(0) were found to be - 126 kJ mol(-1) and ∆S - 340 J mol(-1) K(-1) 
      The negative value of ∆G(0) indicating spontaneous binding between the two 
      molecules. The negative values in ∆H(0) and ∆S(0) indicated van der Waals 
      interaction and hydrogen bonding were involved during the interaction between 
      rivaroxaban and BSA. CONCLUSIONS: The results of molecular docking were 
      consistent with the results obtained from spectroscopic studies in establishing 
      the principal binding site and type of bonds between rivaroxaban and BSA.

TI  - Apixaban Interacts with Haemoglobin: Effects on Its Plasma Levels.
PG  - 1701-1712
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1669920 [doi]
AB  - The direct oral anticoagulant apixaban (APX), a strong factor Xa inhibitor, binds 
      also to plasma proteins, especially albumin, and minimally to α(1)-acid 
      glycoprotein. Although APX can cross the red cell membrane, due to its chemical 
      structure, and could bind to haemoglobin (Hb), no investigation was performed on 
      this possible phenomenon that could affect the APX plasma concentration and thus 
      its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We addressed this issue by (1) 
      measuring the levels of APX and haematological/biochemical parameters in 90 
      patients on APX therapy; (2) assessing the effect of APX on oxygen saturation 
      curves of Hb; (3) testing the direct APX binding to Hb by fluorescence 
      spectroscopy and a zinc-induced precipitation of Hb coupled to a reversed-phase 
      high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based method; and (4) simulating in 
      silico by molecular docking the APX interaction with human Hb. In a multivariable 
      analysis, Hb was the only independent variable significantly and inversely 
      associated in 90 patients with APX peak plasma level, at variance with patients 
      treated with rivaroxaban (n = 86) and dabigatran (n = 34) therapy. APX causes a 
      progressive left-shift of the oxygen dissociation curve of purified Hb solution, 
      with a K(d) ≅300 µM. Fluorescence- and HPLC-based assays concordantly showed that 
      APX binds to Hb with a K(d) ≅350 µM. Finally, docking simulations showed that APX 
      can fit into in the central cavity of Hb. These findings support the hypothesis 
      that APX does bind to Hb, which, due to its millimolar concentration in blood, 
      can act as 'buffer' for the drug and consequently affect its free plasma level.

TI  - Enhanced Biopharmaceutical Performance of Rivaroxaban through Polymeric Amorphous 
      Solid Dispersion.

AB  - Rivaroxaban (RXB) is an orally active direct inhibitor of the activated serine 
      protease Factor Xa, given as monotherapy in the treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE). It has been characterized in vitro as a substrate for the 
      active, nonsaturable efflux via P-gp transporter, limiting its high permeability. 
      Therefore, the role of P-gp inhibiting polymers in enhancing the 
      biopharmaceutical performance of RXB by preparing polymeric amorphous solid 
      dispersion and subsequent improvement in solubility and permeability was 
      investigated. Initially, solubility parameter and Flory-Huggins interaction 
      parameter were determined for miscibility studies between drug and polymers. 
      Binary dispersions were prepared by dissolving drug with polymers eudragit S100, 
      eudragit L100, and soluplus in common solvent (5% v/v water in tetrahydrofuran) 
      using spray dryer. Prepared binary dispersions were analyzed by differential 
      scanning calorimetry (DSC), microscopy, powder X-ray diffractometry (PXRD), 
      Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic vapor sorption (DVS), and 
      solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Superior performance of 
      binary dispersions was observed upon dissolution and solubility studies over 
      micronized active pharmaceutical ingredient. Amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) 
      prepared with soluplus showed 10-fold increase in apparent solubility and 
      maintenance of supersaturation for 24 h compared to the crystalline RXB. Further, 
      pharmacokinetic study performed in animals was in good correlation with the 
      solubility data. Increases of 5.7- and 6.7-fold were observed in AUC and C(max), 
      respectively, for ASDs prepared with soluplus compared to those with crystalline 
      RXB. FTIR and NMR spectroscopy unveiled the involvement of N-H group of RXB with 
      C═O group of polymers in intermolecular interactions. The decreased drug efflux 
      ratio was observed for ASDs prepared with eudragit S100 and soluplus in Caco-2 
      transport study suggesting improvement in the absorption of RXB. Hence, the 
      present study demonstrates ASD using soluplus as a promising formulation strategy 
      for enhancing the biopharmaceutical performance of RXB by increasing the 
      solubility and circumventing the P-gp activity.

TI  - Comparison of potential pharmacokinetic drug interactions in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation and changing from warfarin to non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant 
      therapy.
PG  - 1110-1116
LID - 10.1007/s11239-021-02466-8 [doi]
AB  - There are now anticoagulant choices with proposed advantages of non-vitamin K 
      oral anticoagulants (NOACs) over warfarin being less routine monitoring and less 
      drug interactions. Interacting medication can impact the efficacy and safety of 
      anticoagulant therapy with management remaining clinically challenging. There 
      have been limited studies comparing the potential for pharmacokinetic (PK) drug 
      interactions between different anticoagulants. Therefore, the aim of this study 
      was to compare potential PK interactions in patients with atrial fibrillation 
      (AF) changing from warfarin to NOAC therapy. A retrospective analysis was 
      conducted of patients with AF enrolled in a dedicated warfarin program but 
      exiting this program to commence a NOAC. Patient data was collected, and 
      concurrent medications were utilised to identify potential PK drug interactions 
      with both warfarin and the chosen NOAC therapy. Patients were grouped according 
      to the number of medications with potential PK interactions and comparisons made 
      between groups. Of the 712 eligible patients who ceased warfarin to commence a 
      NOAC, most commenced either apixaban (45.9%) or rivaroxaban (41.9%). When 
      comparing warfarin to NOACs, there were significant differences in the proportion 
      of patients taking no medication with potential PK drug interactions (46.9% vs 
      62.8%, p < 0.0001), and taking one (35.2% vs 28.5%, p = 0.0067) and two (14.5% vs 
      7.3%, p < 0.0001) potentially PK interacting medications. This study found when 
      patients with AF were switched from warfarin to a NOAC, the potential for PK drug 
      interactions significantly reduced but remained around 40%. Identifying and 
      managing potential PK drug interactions with NOACs remains a priority to optimise 
      clinical benefit of these anticoagulants.

TI  - Rivaroxaban or Apixaban for Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation　- Efficacy and 
      Safety of Off-Label Under-Dosing According to Plasma Concentration.
PG  - 991-999
LID - 10.1253/circj.CJ-18-1282 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Practice-based investigations on direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) 
      treatment for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) have shown that off-label 
      under-dosing is increasingly becoming an issue. Here, we investigate the 
      significance of drug monitoring to prevent undesirable under-dosing with DOAC. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: In 255 outpatients with NVAF undergoing treatment with 
      rivaroxaban or apixaban we estimated the cut-offs for bleeding events using drug 
      plasma concentration (PC) data 3 h after drug treatment, that is, at the peak 
      level. Furthermore, we evaluated the appropriateness of labeled and off-label 
      dosing implemented for 348 patients using the obtainable PC threshold. A total of 
      73 off-label under-dose users of rivaroxaban (37% of all users and 63% of lower 
      dose users) had acceptable peak PC (155-400 ng/mL). Additionally, 46 off-label 
      under-dose users of apixaban (31% of all users and 55% of lower dose users) 
      received appropriate doses according to peak PC threshold (90-386.4 ng/mL). These 
      off-label under-dose users reported no bleeding or thromboembolic events during 
      follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulation monitoring enables personalized and 
      appropriate off-label under-dosing in NVAF patients on rivaroxaban or apixaban 
      through the measurement of peak PC during DOAC use.

TI  - The Impact of Rivaroxaban and Apixaban on Tacrolimus Trough Levels.
PG  - 236-241
LID - 10.1177/15269248211024601 [doi]
AB  - The solid organ transplant community is slow to adopt the routine practice of 
      using direct oral anticoagulants. Rivaroxaban and apixaban share common metabolic 
      pathways with tacrolimus. This study aimed to clarify the impact of 
      rivaroxaban/apixaban on tacrolimus troughs. Fifty solid organ transplant 
      recipients with concomitant use of tacrolimus and rivaroxaban/apixaban were 
      retrospectively assessed for changes in tacrolimus troughs and dose. Average 
      dose-adjusted tacrolimus troughs and average tacrolimus total daily doses prior 
      to and after rivaroxaban/apixaban initiation were compared. Subgroup analyses 
      evaluating rivaroxaban and apixaban individually were performed. Rivaroxaban was 
      prescribed to 18 recipients, and apixaban was prescribed to 32 recipients. 
      Transplanted organs included kidney (n = 22), lung (n = 18), liver (n = 7), 
      simultaneous pancreas and kidney (n = 1), and simultaneous kidney and liver (n = 
      2). The median doseadjusted tacrolimus trough and tacrolimus total daily dose 
      prior to rivaroxaban/apixaban initiation was 2.15 ng/mL/mg (IQR 1.17, 3.37) and 4 
      mg (IQR 1.88, 6.25), respectively. The median dose-adjusted tacrolimus trough and 
      tacrolimus total daily dose after rivaroxaban/apixaban initiation was 2.16 
      ng/mL/mg (IQR 1.24, 4.10) and 3.55 mg (IQR 1.5, 6.35), respectively. No 
      significant difference was found between average dose-adjusted tacrolimus troughs 
      or tacrolimus total daily doses before and after rivaroxaban/apixaban initiation 
      or in the individual subgroup analyses for rivaroxaban/apixaban. It is unlikely 
      that initiating rivaroxaban/apixaban affects tacrolimus troughs or requires 
      tacrolimus dose adjustment. This study does not elucidate if tacrolimus affects 
      rivaroxaban/apixaban pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the prevalence and nature of potential drug-drug 
      interactions (DDIs) with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in elderly 
      hospitalized patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study. 
      Inclusion criteria were: aged over 65 years; taking apixaban, rivaroxaban or 
      dabigatran; and admitted to the Repatriation General Hospital between April 2014 
      and July 2015. A list of clinically relevant 'perpetrator' drugs was compiled 
      from product information, the Australian Medicines Handbook, the Australian 
      National Prescribing Service resources, and local health network guidelines. The 
      prevalence and nature of potential DDIs with DOACs was determined by comparing 
      inpatient drug charts with the list of perpetrator drugs. RESULTS: There were 122 
      patients in the study with a mean age of 82 years. Most patients had nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation and were taking DOACs to prevent thrombotic stroke (83%). 
      Overall, 45 patients (37%) had a total of 54 potential DDIs. Thirty-five patients 
      had potential pharmacodynamic DDIs with antidepressants, nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets (35/122, 29%). Nineteen patients had 
      potential pharmacokinetic DDIs (19/122, 16%). Of these, 68% (13/19) were taking 
      drugs that increase DOAC plasma concentrations (amiodarone, erythromycin, 
      diltiazem or verapamil) and 32% (6/19) were taking drugs that decrease DOAC 
      plasma concentrations (carbamazepine, primidone or phenytoin). There were no 
      cases of patients taking contraindicated interacting drugs. DISCUSSION: Potential 
      DDIs with DOACs in elderly hospital inpatients are relatively common, 
      particularly interactions that may increase the risk of bleeding. The 
      risk-benefit ratio of DOACs in elderly patients on polypharmacy should always be 
      carefully considered.

AB  - Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections are one of the most frequent 
      infectious disease requiring hospitalization for treatment. Delafloxacin is a 
      clinically approved fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of ABSSSIs. In 
      spite of being marketed since 2017, there is no published analytical method for 
      quantification of delafloxacin in biological samples. Herein, a selective and 
      sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for quantitative analysis 
      of delafloxacin in rat plasma and rabbit aqueous humour samples. The liquid 
      liquid extraction (using ethyl acetate) was used for analyte extraction form rat 
      plasma, whereas protein precipitation (acetonitrile) was used for aqueous humour 
      samples preparations. An Acquity UPLC BEH C(18) column was used for 
      chromatographic separation of delafloxacin and internal standard (rivaroxaban). 
      The mobile phase composition of acetonitrile (containing 0.1% formic acid) and 
      10 mM ammonium acetate in ratio of 60:40 were used for sample elution at 
      300 µL/min flow rate. The electrospray ionization operated in positive mode was 
      used for sample ionization and detection of analyte and internal standard were 
      performed by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The MRM transitions were 
      set to 441.14 > 379.09 and 436.89 > 144.87 for delafloxacin and internal 
      standard, respectively. The method was validated as per USFDA guideline for 
      bioanalytical method and all the evaluated parameters were within the acceptable 
      ranges. The developed method in plasma was successfully used to analyze samples 
      in pharmacokinetic study of newly developed stearic acid-chitosan solid lipid 
      nanoparticles formulation of delafloxacin in rat.

TI  - Associations between model-predicted rivaroxaban exposure and patient 
      characteristics and efficacy and safety outcomes in the treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism.
PG  - 1-11

AB  - Anticoagulant plasma concentrations and patient characteristics might affect the 
      benefit-risk balance of therapy. This study assessed the impact of 
      model-predicted rivaroxaban exposure and patient characteristics on outcomes in 
      patients receiving rivaroxaban for venous thromboembolism treatment (VTE-T) using 
      data from the phase 3 EINSTEIN-DVT and EINSTEIN-PE studies. In the absence of 
      measured rivaroxaban exposure, exposure estimates were predicted based on 
      individual increases in prothrombin time (PT) and the known correlation between 
      rivaroxaban plasma concentrations and PT dynamics. The composite efficacy 
      outcomes evaluated were recurrent deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary 
      embolism (PE) and recurrent DVT, PE and all-cause death; safety outcomes were 
      major bleeding and the composite of major or non-major clinically relevant (NMCR) 
      bleeding. Exposure-response relationships were evaluated using multivariate 
      logistic and Cox regression for the twice-daily (BID) and once-daily (OD) dosing 
      periods, respectively. Predicted rivaroxaban exposure and CrCl were significantly 
      associated with both efficacy outcomes in the BID period. In the OD period, 
      exposure was significantly associated with recurrent DVT and PE but not recurrent 
      DVT, PE and all-cause death. The statistically significant exposure-efficacy 
      relationships were shallow. Exposure-safety relationships were absent within the 
      investigated exposure range. During both dosing periods, low baseline hemoglobin 
      and prior bleeding were associated with the composite of major or NMCR bleeding. 
      In conclusion, based on the underlying data and analysis, no reliable target 
      window for exposure with improved benefit-risk could be identified within the 
      investigated exposure range. Therefore, monitoring rivaroxaban levels is unlikely 
      to be beneficial in VTE-T.

AB  - Factor Xa (FXa) is a serine protease that plays key roles in linking the 
      intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways to the final common pathway. 
      DJT06001 is an oral, highly specific and direct FXa inhibitor for the prevention 
      and treatment of thromboembolic diseases. We characterized the compound in vitro 
      and studied its in vivo activity in rat thrombosis models, as well as bleeding 
      risk and Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) relationship. DJT06001 
      inhibited free FXa with an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 0.99 nM, and exhibited 
      >10000-fold selectivity for FXa than for other related serine proteases. DJT06001 
      concentration-dependently inhibited FXa activity in the prothrombinase complex 
      with an IC(50) of 2.53 nM. The concentrations for DJT06001 to double the 
      prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were 0.74 
      and 0.57 μM, respectively. Importantly, DJT06001 did not impair platelet 
      aggregation induced by ADP, platelet activating factor (PAF) and collagen. 
      Furthermore, DJT06001 inhibited thrombus formation in rat thrombosis models in a 
      dose dependent manner. And in rat tail bleeding risk test, it caused less 
      bleeding than rivaroxaban at doses that achieve the same antithrombotic effect. 
      PK/PD studies further demonstrated that there was a good correlation between the 
      plasma concentrations of DJT06001and its inhibition of plasma FXa activity and 
      prolongation of PT. In conclusion, DJT06001 was shown to be a potent and specific 
      FXa inhibitor with excellent PK/PD profiles and it could be developed as a new 
      anticoagulant for the management of thromboembolic diseases.

TI  - Betrixaban for Extended Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in High-Risk 
      Hospitalized Patients: Putting the APEX Results into Practice.
PG  - 291-302

AB  - Acutely ill hospitalized medical patients remain at high thromboembolic risk for 
      several weeks after discharge. Previous trials with extended-duration 
      thromboprophylaxis using enoxaparin, apixaban, and rivaroxaban failed to achieve 
      acceptable net clinical benefit, largely due to excess of major bleeding. 
      Betrixaban is a novel factor Xa inhibitor with unique pharmacokinetic properties, 
      including low renal clearance, long half-life, and low peak-to-trough ratio. The 
      phase III APEX trial (N = 7513) compared a betrixaban 160 mg loading dose 
      followed by 80 mg once daily for 35-42 days, with enoxaparin 40 mg once daily for 
      6-14 days; the betrixaban dose was reduced for renal impairment or a concomitant 
      strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor. The primary efficacy endpoint of 
      composite thrombotic events was not different between treatment arms in cohort 1 
      (D-dimer ≥ 2 × upper limit of normal). Subsequent exploratory analyses showed a 
      statistically significant difference favoring betrixaban for symptomatic venous 
      thromboembolism and net clinical benefit in the overall population. For the 
      primary safety outcome, betrixaban did not significantly increase major bleeding 
      compared with enoxaparin. Based on available data from the APEX trial and 
      subanalyses, the use of betrixaban in patients similar to those enrolled in the 
      APEX trial can reduce the risk of thromboembolic events without increasing the 
      risk of major bleeding. Patients who may benefit more from betrixaban therapy 
      include those with elevated D-dimer, history of venous thromboembolism, 
      hospitalized for ischemic stroke, hospitalized for heart failure with N-terminal 
      pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ≥ 1975 ng/L, or two or more VTE risk factors. 
      Reduced-dose betrixaban does not appear to provide the same clinical utility as 
      full-dose betrixaban.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor used in human thrombotic 
      disorders. In view of the in vitro concentration dependent anticoagulant effects 
      of rivaroxaban in dogs, the time course of its anticoagulant effects was 
      characterized in healthy dogs. Twenty-four healthy Beagles were randomized into 
      three groups (n = 8 per group) and received orally either a placebo or 20 mg 
      rivaroxaban once or twice at an 8 h interval. Fifteen blood samples were 
      collected over a 30 h period, and blindly assayed for prothrombin time (PT), 
      activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), tissue factor induced thrombin 
      generation (TG) and anti-factor Xa activity. Thromboelastography (TEG) was 
      evaluated at 0, 1, 4, 8 and 24 h. Peak/baseline anticoagulant effect ratios were 
      analyzed with generalized linear models using β distributions and times to return 
      to baseline with survival analyses (α = 0.05). Peak/baseline anticoagulant effect 
      ratios of PT, aPTT, anti-factor Xa activity, TG and R (TEG) differed 
      significantly between placebo and both rivaroxaban groups (P <0.0001). The peak 
      anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban occurred 1.5 to 2 h after dosing. The median 
      return to baseline occurred significantly sooner (P <0.01) with 20 mg rivaroxaban 
      administered once (7.9-18.7 h) versus twice (17.5-26.8 h). The inter-individual 
      variability differed amongst assays, but overall was moderate to large. No 
      adverse effects were recorded. Twice oral administration of 2 mg/kg rivaroxaban 
      at an 8 h interval maintained 24 h anticoagulant activity, but larger studies are 
      needed to establish guidelines for the use of rivaroxaban in dogs.

      characteristics and efficacy and safety outcomes in the prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism.
PG  - 12-19
LID - 10.1007/s11239-020-02078-8 [doi]
AB  - Anticoagulant plasma concentrations and patient characteristics might affect the 
      benefit-risk balance of therapy. The study objective was to assess the impact of 
      model-predicted rivaroxaban exposure and patient characteristics on outcomes in 
      patients receiving rivaroxaban for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis 
      (VTE-P) after hip/knee replacement surgery. Post hoc exposure-response analyses 
      were conducted using data from the phase 3 RECORD1-4 studies, in which 12,729 
      patients were randomized to rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily or enoxaparin 
      for ≤ 39 days. Multivariate regression approaches were used to correlate 
      model-predicted individual rivaroxaban exposures and patient characteristics with 
      outcomes. In the absence of measured rivaroxaban exposure, exposure estimates 
      were predicted based on individual increases in prothrombin time (PT) and by 
      making use of the known correlation between rivaroxaban plasma concentration and 
      dynamics of PT. No significant associations between rivaroxaban exposure and 
      total VTE or major bleeding were identified. A significant association between 
      exposure and a composite of major or non-major clinically relevant (NMCR) 
      bleeding from day 4 after surgery was observed. The relationship was shallow, 
      with an approximate predicted absolute increase in a composite of major or NMCR 
      bleeding from 1.08 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76-1.54] to 2.18% (95% CI 
      1.51-3.17) at the 5th and 95th percentiles of trough plasma concentration, 
      respectively. In conclusion, based on the underlying data and analysis, no 
      reliable target window for exposure with improved benefit-risk could be 
      identified within the investigated exposure range. Hence, monitoring rivaroxaban 
      levels is unlikely to be beneficial in VTE-P.

AB  - A 62-year-old man was admitted to hospital for elective revision of a left total 
      hip arthroplasty. His history was significant for human immunodeficiency virus 
      (HIV) infection for which he was taking the following antiretroviral agents 
      (ARVs): etravirine, ritonavir, darunavir, raltegravir and 
      tenofovir/emtricitabine. Rivaroxaban 10 mg daily was commenced on the second 
      postoperative day for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. Approximately 
      24 h later, the patient developed hypotension and anaemia, accompanied by thigh 
      swelling due to bleeding at the surgical site. Fluid resuscitation was commenced 
      with red cell transfusion. The prothrombin time (PT) was prolonged at 24.3 
      (10.6-15.3) s, and a rivaroxaban level taken 24 h after administration was 
      75 ng/mL. Rivaroxaban was ceased, the PT normalised within 24 h of stopping the 
      drug, and the patient made an uneventful recovery. None of the other 
      coadministered drugs are known to interact with rivaroxaban, or are likely to, 
      based on their metabolic pathways. Rivaroxaban, a substrate for cytochrome P450 
      (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is contraindicated in patients concomitantly 
      treated with strong inhibitors of both these systems, e.g. protease inhibitors 
      (PIs) such as ritonavir (based on in vitro data and a pharmacokinetic study in 
      healthy volunteers). No published data are available on the PI darunavir, a 
      moderate inhibitor; however, concomitant use with rivaroxaban should also be 
      avoided. A prolonged PT and a rivaroxaban trough level greater than eight times 
      that predicted from pharmacokinetic modelling suggests that bleeding was due to 
      increased exposure to rivaroxaban, probably due to an interaction with ritonavir 
      and darunavir. This is supported by a Drug Interaction Probability Scale (DIPS) 
      score of 8. An interaction between a single dose of rivaroxaban and ARVs may be 
      clinically significant; therefore, the patient's medication history should be 
      extensively evaluated to identify any potential interactions.

AB  - The increasing incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in paediatric population 
      has stimulated the development of liquid anticoagulant formulations. Thus our 
      goal is to formulate a liquid formulation of poorly-water soluble anticoagulant, 
      rivaroxaban (RIVA), for paediatric use and to assess the possibility of its 
      intravenous administration in emergencies. Self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery 
      systems (SNEDDSs) were developed and characterized. SNEDDS constituents were 
      estimated from the saturated solubility study followed by plotting the 
      corresponding ternary phase diagrams to determine the best self-emulsified 
      systems. Thermodynamic stability, emulsification, dispersibility, robustness to 
      dilution tests, in vitro dissolution, particle size, and zeta potential were 
      executed to optimize the formulations. The optimized formulation, that composed 
      of Capryol 90:Tween 20:PEG 300 (5:45:50), increased RIVA solubility (285.7-fold 
      than water), it formed nanoemulsion with a particle size of 16.15 nm, PDI of 0.25 
      and zeta potential of -21.8. It released 100.83 ± 2.78% of RIVA after 5 min. 
      SNEDDS was robust to dilution with oral and parenteral fluids and showed safety 
      to human RBCs. SNEDDS showed enhanced bioavailability after oral and intravenous 
      administration than the oral drug suspension (by 1.25 and 1.26-fold, 
      respectively). Moreover, it exhibited enhanced anticoagulant efficacy in the 
      prevention and treatment of carrageenan-induced thrombosis rat model.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are among the most effective options to 
      prevent serious thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. 
      Coagulation assays are used to assess DOAC activity, but lack the possibility to 
      quantify drugs with concurrent pharmacodynamic effect. We developed a selective 
      multi-drug assay to analyze apixaban, betrixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, edoxaban 
      M4, and rivaroxaban with ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to 
      tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) in plasma fulfilling all requirements of 
      the FDA und EMA guidelines for bioanalytical method validation. Plasma samples 
      were extracted using solid phase extraction in a 96-well micro volume format. 
      Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters BEH Phenyl 1.7μm column 
      coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Extraction recoveries exceeded 80 %. 
      Concentrations of 1-1000 ng/ml can be precisely quantified (correlation 
      coefficient of >0.99) using 100 μL plasma volume. Intra-day and inter-day 
      accuracies ranged between 91.0 % and 116 %. Precisions at low and high 
      concentrations were below 13.3 %. The method was applied within a clinical drug 
      trial and eight short pharmacokinetic profiles of patients under DOAC therapy 
      were analyzed. The assay allows for highly sensitive and selective simultaneous 
      quantification of DOACs in patient plasma samples.

TI  - Impact of rivaroxaban plasma concentration on perioperative red blood cell loss.
PG  - 197-205
LID - 10.1111/trf.15560 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigates the impact of preoperative calculated 
      rivaroxaban (RXA) plasma concentration on perioperative red blood cell (RBC) 
      loss. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we 
      identified patients with RXA intake according to a preoperative determination of 
      RXA levels within 96 hours before surgery. RXA plasma concentration at the 
      beginning of surgery was then calculated from the last RXA intake using a 
      single-compartment pharmacokinetic model with four categories of RXA 
      concentration (≤20, 21-50, 51-100, and >100 μg/L). Patients were classified into 
      surgery with high (≥500 mL) or low (<500 mL) expected blood loss. Perioperative 
      bleeding was determined by calculating RBC loss. RESULTS: We analyzed 308 
      surgical interventions in 298 patients during the period from January 2012 to 
      July 2018. Among patients undergoing surgery with low expected blood loss, RBC 
      loss varied from 164 mL (standard deviation [SD], 189) to 302 mL (SD, 397) (p = 
      0.66), and no association of calculated RXA concentration with RBC loss was 
      observed. In patients undergoing surgery with high expected blood loss, we found 
      a significant correlation of calculated RXA concentration with RBC loss 
      (Pearson's correlation coefficient, 0.29; p = 0.002). RBC loss increased with 
      rising RXA concentration from 575 mL (SD, 365) at RXA concentration of 20 μg/L or 
      less up to 1400 mL (SD, 1300) at RXA concentration greater than 100 μg/L. RXA 
      concentration greater than 100 μg/L was associated with a significant increase of 
      in RBC loss of 840 mL (95% confidence interval, 360-1300; p < 0.001). Transfusion 
      of RBC and fresh frozen plasma units tended to increase in patients with RXA 
      concentrations greater than 100 μg/L. The proportion of patients treated with 
      prothrombin complex concentrate and coagulation factor XIII concentrate increased 
      significantly with higher RXA concentrations. CONCLUSION: Only in surgery with 
      high expected blood loss, a calculated RXA concentration of greater than 100 μg/L 
      was associated with a significant increase of perioperative RBC loss.

TI  - Anti-Factor Xa Activity of Standard and Japan-Specific Doses of Rivaroxaban in 
      Thai Patients With Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 1075-1082
LID - 10.1253/circj.CJ-20-0056 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recommended rivaroxaban doses for stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation (SPAF) are 20 and 15 mg/day in patients with normal and reduced 
      renal function, respectively, but lower doses (15 and 10 mg) have been tested and 
      approved in Japan. It is not known whether 15 and 10 mg rivaroxaban are 
      appropriate in other Asian populations. This study compared the anti-Factor Xa 
      (FXa) activity of 20 and 15 mg rivaroxaban in Thai patients with normal renal 
      function and 15 and 10 mg rivaroxaban in patients with reduced renal function. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients receiving 
      rivaroxaban (mean [±SD] age 69.3±9.1 years, mean creatinine clearance 59.2±22.7 
      mL/min) were enrolled. The anti-FXa activity of standard rivaroxaban and 
      Japan-specific doses was measured at peak and trough concentrations. Median 
      anti-FXa activity at peak concentrations was significantly higher for the 
      standard than Japan-specific dose. Median anti-FXa activity measured at the 
      trough was significantly higher for the standard dose only in those with impaired 
      renal function. A higher proportion of patients receiving the Japan-specific 
      rather than standard dose had anti-FXa activity at peak concentrations within the 
      expected range (87.7% vs. 64.4%; P=0.001). One-third of those receiving the 
      standard dose had anti-FXa activity higher than the expected range. CONCLUSIONS: 
      A significantly higher proportion of Thai patients receiving the Japan-specific 
      dose of rivaroxaban had anti-FXa activity at peak concentrations within the 
      expected range.

TI  - Laboratory monitoring of rivaroxaban in Chinese patients with deep venous 
      thrombosis: a preliminary study.
PG  - 38
LID - 10.1186/s40360-020-00414-5 [doi]
LID - 38
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban, a novel oral anticoagulant drug, is widely used in 
      clinical practice. There is no standardized laboratory monitoring for 
      rivaroxaban, and its plasma concentration in Chinese patients with deep vein 
      thrombosis is unclear. The rivaroxaban concentrations in human plasma and 
      determine the steady-state concentration of rivaroxaban in patients with deep 
      vein thrombosis are needed. METHODS: An ultra-high-performance liquid 
      chromatography with mass spectrometric detection method was developed. 
      Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters BEH C18 column with 
      isocratic elution using a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and water. 
      Quantitation of the analytes was performed using positive ionization mode and 
      mass transitions of m/z 437.3 → m/z 145.0 and m/z 440.1 → m/z 145.0 for 
      rivaroxaban and the internal standard, respectively. Blood samples were collected 
      at 0 h and 2 h after patients took rivaroxaban for 7 days or more. RESULTS: The 
      method was validated over the concentration range of 0.5 ~ 400 ng•mL(- 1) with a 
      very low limit of quantification of 0.5 ng·mL(- 1), and the intra- and inter-day 
      precision (RSD%) were < 15%. The range of the steady state concentration in 
      patients that took 15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily, 10 mg twice daily, 20 mg once 
      daily, 15 mg once daily, and 10 mg once daily were 168.5 ~ 280.1 ng•mL(- 1), 
      74.2 ~ 271.4 ng•mL(- 1), 25.7 ~ 306.8 ng•mL(- 1), 24.5 ~ 306.4 ng•mL(- 1), and 
      15.4 ~ 229.2 ng•mL(- 1), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The plasma rivaroxaban 
      concentration in patients who took 10 mg rivaroxaban twice daily fluctuated less 
      than that in patients who took 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily. The plasma 
      concentration can be used for therapeutic drug monitoring for rivaroxaban.

TI  - Rivaroxaban Precision Dosing Strategy for Real-World Atrial Fibrillation 
      Patients.
PG  - 777-784
LID - 10.1111/cts.12766 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is a direct-acting oral anticoagulant approved to prevent strokes in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation. Dosage recommendations are approved for all 
      adult patients to receive either 15 mg or 20 mg once daily depending upon renal 
      function. There are a number of reasons to believe rivaroxaban dosing could be 
      more effective and/or safer for more patients if increased dosing precision is 
      available. Because real-world patients are more diverse than those studied in 
      phase III clinical trials, we evaluated the extremes of creatinine clearance 
      (CrCl) on rivaroxaban clearance using a published population pharmacokinetic 
      model and applying exposure variation limits (±20%) based on published 
      literature. The proposed dosing recommendations are 10 mg once daily (CrCl 
      15-29 ml/min), 15 mg once daily (CrCl 30-69 ml/min), 10 mg twice daily (CrCl 
      70-159 ml/min), and 15 mg twice daily (CrCl 160-250 ml/min). These new dosing 
      recommendations should be prospectively tested for predictive accuracy and to 
      assess the impact on AF patient efficacy and safety.

TI  - Apixaban: a new factor Xa inhibitor for stroke prevention in patients with 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 207-12
LID - 10.1097/CRD.0b013e318293d6e6 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke 
      occurrence, severity, recurrence, and mortality. Anticoagulation therapy for the 
      prevention of thromboembolism is critical in patients with AF who are at risk of 
      stroke. Warfarin has been an efficacious anticoagulant for this purpose, but its 
      use has been limited by frequent laboratory monitoring, drug interactions, 
      unpredictable individual response, delayed onset of action, and bleeding. 
      Apixaban is the second oral direct selective factor Xa inhibitor approved for the 
      prevention of stroke/systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. It was 
      significantly better than aspirin in reducing stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or 
      systemic embolism without increasing the risk of major bleeding in patients with 
      AF who were at increased risk of stroke and for whom warfarin was unsuitable. In 
      a randomized, double-blind trial that was originally designed to test for 
      noninferiority, apixaban was superior to warfarin (target international 
      normalized ratio 2-3) in preventing stroke or systemic embolism, caused less 
      bleeding, and resulted in lower mortality in patients with AF. Apixaban has a 
      half-life of about 12 hours, and the normal dosage is 5 mg orally twice daily. 
      However, it may be reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily based on individual factors of 
      the patient (age, renal function, and body weight) and the concomitant use of 
      potent dual inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein. Similar to 
      other novel oral anticoagulants (dabigatran and rivaroxaban), apixaban has no 
      reversal agent for its anticoagulant effect. Overall, apixaban is a safe and 
      efficacious alternative for stroke prophylaxis in high-risk patients who have AF 
      and who are unable to achieve therapeutic goals with warfarin therapy.

AB  - Several case reports and one thorough pharmacokinetic analysis consistently 
      indicate that maternal doses of rivaroxaban of 15 to 30 mg daily produce low 
      levels in milk that are considerably below doses (<2%) required for 
      anticoagulation in infants. Plasma rivaroxaban levels in two breastfed infants 
      were undetectable. If the mother requires rivaroxaban, it is not a reason to 
      discontinue breastfeeding.[1]

TI  - Direct oral anticoagulant plasma levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are not recommended in COVID-19 patients 
      receiving dexamethasone because of potential drug-drug and drug-disease 
      interactions affecting anticoagulant concentration and activity. To evaluate 
      short- and long-term pharmacokinetic interactions, serial through and peak DOAC 
      plasma levels were prospectively measured during and after dexamethasone therapy, 
      as well as during the acute phase and after recovery from COVID-19 in 
      hospitalized, non-critically ill patients undergoing treatment with DOACs. 
      Thirty-three (18 males, mean age 79 years) consecutive patients received DOACs 
      (17 apixaban, 12 rivaroxaban, 4 edoxaban) for atrial fibrillation (n = 22), 
      venous thromboembolism (n = 10), and acute myocardial infarction (n = 1). 
      Twenty-six patients also received dexamethasone at a dose of 6 mg once daily for 
      a median of 14 days. Trough DOAC levels on dexamethasone were within and below 
      expected reference ranges respectively in 87.5 and 8.3% of patients, with no 
      statistically significant differences at 48-72 h and 14-21 days after 
      dexamethasone discontinuation. Peak DOAC levels on dexamethasone were within 
      expected reference ranges in 58.3% of patients, and below ranges in 33.3%, of 
      whom over two thirds had low values also off dexamethasone. No significant 
      differences in DOAC levels were found during hospitalization and after resolution 
      of COVID-19. Overall, 28 patients were discharged alive, and none experienced 
      thrombotic or bleeding events. In this study, dexamethasone administration or 
      acute COVID-19 seemed not to affect DOAC levels in hospitalized, non-critically 
      ill COVID-19 patients.

      Crossover Study.
PG  - 358-363
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.1031 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor used for the management of 
      thromboembolic disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, 
      pharmacokinetic profile, and bioequivalence of a generic and a branded 
      rivaroxaban formulation (Xarelto) under fasted and fed conditions in healthy 
      Chinese volunteers. An open-label, randomized, single-dose, 4-period complete, 
      and replicate crossover study in healthy Chinese volunteers was performed. A 
      single oral dose of 20 mg of 2 rivaroxaban formulations was administered to 72 
      healthy volunteers, with 36 in the fasted group and 36 consuming a high-fat diet. 
      The evaluated pharmacokinetic parameters, including maximum rivaroxaban 
      concentration, the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to 
      the last measurable concentration, and AUC from time 0 to infinity, were assessed 
      for BE. The plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban were measured by a validated 
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. The geometric mean ratios 
      with 90% confidence intervals of the maximum rivaroxaban concentration, AUC from 
      time 0 to the last measurable concentration, and AUC from time 0 to infinity were 
      all within the range of 80% to 125% under fasted and fed conditions. The 
      within-subject variability of the test and reference products was compared, and 
      the upper limit of the 90% confidence intervals for the test-to-reference ratio 
      of the within-subject variability was <2.5, which indicated that the rivaroxaban 
      test and the rivaroxaban reference formulation were bioequivalent. No serious 
      adverse events were reported during either fasted or fed conditions of the study.

      parameters in patients who massively ingested DOACs. METHODS: We conducted a 
      5-year cohort study including consecutive massive DOAC ingestion patients 
      admitted to two critical care departments. Patients were managed in accordance 
      with standards of care. We collected the main history, clinical, laboratory, 
      management and outcome data. The time-course of plasma DOAC concentrations 
      measured using specific assays was modelled. RESULTS: Twelve patients (3F/9M; 
      age, 55 years [41-63], median [25th-75th percentiles]) were included. Ingestions 
      involved rivaroxaban (n = 7), apixaban (n = 3) and dabigatran (n = 2), with 
      presumed doses of 9.4-fold [5.0-22.0] the full daily dose. Six patients received 
      activated charcoal but no antidote nor blood-derived product. No bleeding was 
      observed. One patient died due to refractory cardiogenic shock related to 
      bisoprolol co-intoxication. Highest observed peak plasma concentrations were 
      1720 ng/ml (rivaroxaban), 750 ng/ml (apixaban) and 644 ng/ml (dabigatran). Times 
      to reach DOAC concentration below 50 ng/ml were ~20-45 h (rivaroxaban), ~125 h 
      (apixaban) and ~30-50 h (dabigatran). Elimination half-lives were 2.5-25.5 h 
      (rivaroxaban), 22.0 and 36.5 h (apixaban), and 5.8 and 15.5 h (dabigatran), with 
      substantial interindividual variability and prolongation in case of 
      cardiovascular failure related to co-intoxicants. Charcoal administration, even 
      if delayed, may have contributed to limit toxicity, possibly by reducing 
      absorption and/or enteroenteric recycling. CONCLUSION: No bleeding was observed 
      in this series of massive DOAC ingestions despite elevated plasma concentrations. 
      No patient required specific haemostatic agents. Charcoal administration should 
      be considered to limit toxicity.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetics of Rivaroxaban in Chinese Patients with Non-Valvular 
      Atrial Fibrillation: A Prospective Multicenter Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Rivaroxaban is a novel oral anticoagulant widely used 
      for thromboprophylaxis in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). 
      The present study aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model for 
      rivaroxaban in Chinese patients with NVAF. METHODS: We performed a prospective 
      multicenter study. The plasma concentration of rivaroxaban was directly detected 
      by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) 
      and indirectly by rivaroxaban-calibrated chromogenic anti-Xa assay (STA(®)). Gene 
      polymorphisms were detected by MassARRAY single nucleotide polymorphism 
      genotyping technology. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was used to develop the 
      PPK model for rivaroxaban in patients with NVAF, and we simulated the 
      steady-state rivaroxaban exposures under different dosing strategies in different 
      covariate levels. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients from five centers were 
      recruited, including 263 plasma concentrations detected by HPLC-MS/MS, 2626 gene 
      polymorphisms, and 131 plasma concentrations detected by anti-Xa assay. In our 
      study, an oral one-compartment model was used to describe the pharmacokinetics of 
      rivaroxaban in patients with NVAF. In the final model, the estimated apparent 
      clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F) were 5.79 L/h (relative 
      standard error [RSE] 4.4%) and 51.5 L (RSE 5.0%), respectively. Covariates in the 
      final model included creatinine clearance, total bilirubin, rs4728709, and body 
      weight. The simulation results showed that in the 15 mg once-daily dosing 
      regimen, in most instances the maximum plasma concentration at steady state 
      (C(max,ss)) and trough plasma concentration at steady state (C(min,ss)) were in 
      the target range for different covariate levels. When patients were administered 
      rivaroxaban 15 or 20 mg once daily, the C(max,ss) and C(min,ss) in the different 
      bodyweight levels were also in the target range. For patients with the ABCB1 
      rs4728709 mutation, the C(min,ss) in the 10, 15, and 20 mg once-daily dosing 
      regimens were lower than the target range. The anti-Xa assay was highly linearly 
      correlated with the HPLC-MS/MS method [y = 1.014x - 2.4648 (R(2) = 0.97)]. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study was the first multicenter PPK model for rivaroxaban in 
      Chinese patients with NVAF (Alfalfa-RIVAAF-PPK). The study found that 15 mg once 
      daily may be suitable as the principal rivaroxaban dose for Chinese patients with 
      NVAF. For patients with the rs4728709 mutation, it may be necessary to examine 
      insufficient anticoagulation. We found that the rivaroxaban-calibrated 
      chromogenic anti-Xa assay and HPLC-MS/MS method were highly linearly correlated. 
      Prospective studies with larger sample sizes and real-world studies are needed 
      for further verification.

AB  - Background: The rivaroxaban dose regimen for patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF) is complex in Asia. Given the high interindividual 
      variability and the risk of bleeding caused by rivaroxaban in Asians, the 
      influencing factors and the relationship between outlier biomarkers and bleeding 
      events need exploration. Methods: The integrated pharmacokinetics 
      (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) models were characterized based on rich PK/PD data 
      from 304 healthy volunteers and sparse PD [anti-factor Xa activity (anti-Xa) and 
      prothrombin (PT)] data from 223 patients with NVAF. The correlations between PD 
      biomarkers and clinically relevant bleedings in 1 year were explored. The final 
      integrated PK/PD model was used to evaluate the influence of dosage and 
      individual covariates on PD parameters. Results: A two-compartment, linear model 
      with sequential zero-order and first-order absorption was adopted. The 
      dose-specific relative bioavailability (F(1)), diet status, creatinine clearance, 
      and body mass index (BMI) improved the model fit. The apparent systemic clearance 
      was 7.39 L/h, and the central and peripheral volumes were 10.9 and 50.9 L, 
      respectively. The linear direct-effects model with shape factor plus the additive 
      (and/or proportional) error model described the correlation between anti-Xa/PT 
      and plasma concentration. Bodyweight, total cholesterol (TCHO), and diet status 
      were selected as the covariates of the anti-Xa/PT model. Anti-Xa was more 
      sensitive to the increase in rivaroxaban exposure compared with PT. An elevated 
      bleeding tendency was seen with higher peak anti-Xa and PT. For a typical Chinese 
      patient, the peak anti-Xa value (median (5%-95% PI)) of 20 and 15 mg were 
      309 ng/ml (139-597 ng/ml) and 296 ng/ml (138-604 ng/ml), both median values were 
      within the expected range. For patients with CrCL 30-49 ml/min, the median peak 
      anti-Xa with recommended 10 mg other than 15 mg were within the expected range. 
      Conclusion: Fixed doses of rivaroxaban could be prescribed for patients with NVAF 
      without adjustment for bodyweight, BMI, and TCHO. Randomized studies should be 
      performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose rivaroxaban in Chinese 
      patients with NVAF.

TI  - Amiodarone, Verapamil, or Diltiazem Use With Direct Oral Anticoagulants and the 
      Risk of Hemorrhage in Older Adults.
PG  - 315-323
LID - 10.1016/j.cjco.2021.11.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Routinely used cardiac medications, based on pharmacokinetics, are 
      hypothesized to increase drug levels of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), with 
      the potential to increase the risk of hemorrhage. We set out to compare the risk 
      for hemorrhage following initiation of amiodarone, verapamil, or diltiazem 
      (moderate cytochrome P450 3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein activity) vs metoprolol or 
      amlodipine (weak or no activity), among older adults prescribed DOACs. METHODS: 
      We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of all adults (aged ≥ 
      66 years) on a DOAC (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban; n = 295,038) who were 
      newly prescribed amiodarone (n = 4872), verapamil (n = 1284), or diltiazem (n = 
      14,638), compared with metoprolol or amlodipine, from Ontario, Canada 
      (2009-2016). The outcome was hospital admission or emergency room visit with a 
      major hemorrhage (upper or lower gastrointestinal tract, intracranial), examined 
      using weighted models. RESULTS: A total of 1737 hemorrhage events occurred 
      (amiodarone, 80 [1.6%] vs metoprolol 503 [2.3%]; verapamil, 32 [2.5%] vs 
      amlodipine, 406 [1.6%]; diltiazem, 312 [2.1%] vs amlodipine, 404 [1.5%]). The 
      weighted risk of major hemorrhage was not elevated with amiodarone, verapamil, or 
      diltiazem initiation in DOAC users, compared to metoprolol or amlodipine, during 
      the full follow-up period (hazard ratio [HR; 95% confidence interval]: amiodarone 
      HR 0.77 [0.61-0.97]; verapamil HR 1.32 [0.88-1.98]; diltiazem HR 0.99 
      [0.85-1.15]). This finding was consistent with a broader definition of bleeding, 
      adjusting for kidney function, by DOAC type or dosage. CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhage 
      risk with amiodarone, verapamil, and diltiazem was similar to that with 
      comparators, among DOAC users aged > 66 years.

AB  - The mechanism underlying large individual differences in the response to oral 
      anticoagulants has not been fully clarified, and the influence of the intestinal 
      microbiome on exogenous drug metabolism has gradually become an area of increased 
      research interest. However, there has been no research into the influence of the 
      gut microbiota on the pharmacokinetics of oral anticoagulants. Therefore, our 
      study is the first to investigate the effect of the intestinal flora on oral 
      anticoagulant metabolism and the associated mechanism. Antibiotics affected the 
      diversity and abundance of the intestinal flora. Compared with the control group, 
      the bioavailability of warfarin and rivaroxaban were significantly increased in 
      the amoxicillin-treated group, whereas the bioavailability of dabigatran 
      increased and subsequently decreased. Compared with the control group, the 
      expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and nuclear 
      receptor, PXR, were altered in the amoxicillin -treated groups. This trend was 
      consistent with the pharmacokinetic results. Changes in the intestinal flora can 
      affect the expression of liver drug enzymes and P-gp, as well as affect the 
      transport and metabolism of oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, dabigatracin, 
      and rivaroxaban), leading to differences in the efficacy of oral anticoagulants. 
      This study revealed a novel mechanism for influencing individual differences in 
      the treatment efficacy of oral anticoagulants.

TI  - Impact of the Genotype and Phenotype of CYP3A and P-gp on the Apixaban and 
      Rivaroxaban Exposure in a Real-World Setting.
LID - 10.3390/jpm12040526 [doi]
LID - 526
AB  - Apixaban and rivaroxaban are the two most prescribed direct factor Xa inhibitors. 
      With the increased use of DOACs in real-world settings, safety and efficacy 
      concerns have emerged, particularly regarding their concomitant use with other 
      drugs. Increasing evidence highlights drug−drug interactions with CYP3A/P-gp 
      modulators leading to adverse events. However, current recommendations for dose 
      adjustment do not consider CYP3A/P-gp genotype and phenotype. We aimed to 
      determine their impact on apixaban and rivaroxaban blood exposure. Three-hundred 
      hospitalized patients were included. CYP3A and P-gp phenotypic activities were 
      assessed by the metabolic ratio of midazolam and AUC0−6h of fexofenadine, 
      respectively. Relevant CYP3A and ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms were also tested. 
      Capillary blood samples collected at four time-points after apixaban or 
      rivaroxaban administration allowed the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. 
      According to the developed multivariable linear regression models, P-gp activity 
      (p < 0.001) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) (p = 0.01) significantly affected 
      apixaban AUC0−6h. P-gp activity (p < 0.001) also significantly impacted 
      rivaroxaban AUC0−6h. The phenotypic switch (from normal to poor metabolizer) of 
      P-gp led to an increase of apixaban and rivaroxaban AUC0−6h by 16% and 25%, 
      respectively, equivalent to a decrease of 38 mL/min in CrCl according to the 
      apixaban model. CYP3A phenotype and tested SNPs of CYP3A/P-gp had no significant 
      impact. In conclusion, P-gp phenotypic activity, rather than known CYP3A/P-gp 
      polymorphisms, could be relevant for dose adjustment.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential of solid 
      dispersion adsorbate (SDA) to improve the solubility and bioavailability of 
      rivaroxaban (RXN). SDA of RXN was developed by fusion method using PEG 4000 as 
      carrier and Neusilin as adsorbent. A 3(2) full factorial design was utilized to 
      formulate various SDAs. The selected independent variables were the amount of 
      carrier (X(1)) and amount of adsorbent (X(2)). The responses measured were the 
      time required for 85% drug release (Y(1)) and saturated solubility (Y(2)). MTT 
      assay was employed for cytotoxicity studies on Caco-2 cells. In vivo 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic evaluations were carried out to assess the 
      prepared SDA. Pre-compression evaluation of SDA suggests the prepared batches 
      (B1-B9) possess adequate flow properties and could be used for compression of 
      tablets. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction data signified 
      the conversion of the crystalline form of drug to amorphous form, a key parameter 
      accountable for improvement in drug dissolution. Optimization data suggests that 
      the amount of carrier and amount of adsorbent significantly (P < 0.05) influence 
      both dependent variables. Post-compression data signifies that the 
      compressibility behavior of prepared tablets was within the official standard 
      limits. A significant increase (P < 0.0001) in the in vitro dissolution 
      characteristics of RXN was noticed in optimized SDA (> 85% in 10 min) as compared 
      to the pure drug, marketed product, and directly compressible tablet. 
      Cytotoxicity studies confirmed the nontoxicity of prepared RXN SDA tablets. RXN 
      SDA tablets exhibited 2.79- and 1.85-fold higher AUC in comparison to RXN 
      suspension and Xarelto tablets respectively indicating improved oral 
      bioavailability. Higher bleeding time and percentage of platelet aggregation 
      noticed with RXN SDA tablets in comparison to RXN suspension further substantiate 
      the efficacy of the prepared formulation. In summary, the results showed the 
      potential of RXN SDA tablets to enhance the bioavailability of RXN and hence can 
      be an alternate approach of solid dosage form for its development for commercial 
      application.

TI  - Rivaroxaban population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling in Iranian 
      patients.
PG  - 1284-1292
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.13673 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Although predictable pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic of rivaroxaban allow fixed dosing regimens without routine 
      coagulation monitoring, there is still the necessity to monitor and predict the 
      effects of rivaroxaban in specific conditions and different populations. The 
      current study was designed and conducted to analyze the rivaroxaban population 
      pharmacokinetics in Iranian patients and establish a 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model to predict the relationship between 
      rivaroxaban concentration and its anticoagulant activity. METHODS: A sequential 
      nonlinear mixed effect pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling method was used 
      to establish the relation between rivaroxaban concentration and anti-factor Xa 
      activity, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) as 
      pharmacodynamic biomarkers in a population of sixty-nine Iranian patients under 
      treatment with oral rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban plasma concentration was quantified 
      by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 
      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The typical population values (inter-individual 
      variability%) of the oral volume of distribution and clearance for a 
      one-compartment model were 61.2 L (21%) and 3.68 L·h(-1) (61%), respectively. 
      Creatinine clearance and Child-Turcotte-Pugh score were found to affect the 
      clearance. A direct link linear structural model best fitted the data for both 
      prothrombin time and aPTT. The baseline estimates of aPTT and prothrombin time in 
      the population were 35.0 (15%) and 12.6 (2%) seconds, respectively. The slope of 
      the relationship between apTT, prothrombin time, and rivaroxaban concentration 
      was 0.033 (28%) and 0.018 (54%) s·ml·ng(-1) , respectively. The selected model 
      for anti-factor Xa activity consisted of a direct link inhibitory E(max) model 
      with Hill coefficient. The maximum level of inhibition (E(max) ) was 4 IU·ml(-1) 
      . The concentration of rivaroxaban producing 50% of the maximum inhibitory effect 
      (EC(50) ) was 180 (24%) ng·ml(-1) , and Hill coefficient (γ) was 1.44 (108%). No 
      covariates showed a statistically significant effect on PT and activated partial 
      thromboplastin time prolonging properties and anti-factor Xa activity. WHAT IS 
      NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed that pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
      models similar to those of the other studies describe the relationship between 
      the rivaroxaban concentration and its anticoagulant effect in Iranian patients. 
      However, considerable differences were observed in the parameters of the 
      pharmacodynamics-pharmacokinetic models with the results of other reports that 
      can explain the unpredictable effects of rivaroxaban in some patients.

TI  - A Single-blind, Randomized, Single-dose, Two-sequence, Two-period, Crossover 
      Study to Assess the Bioequivalence between Two Oral Tablet Formulations of 
      Rivaroxaban 20 mg in Healthy Mexican Volunteers.

AB  - The objective of this study was to demonstrate the bioequivalence of 2 oral 
      tablet formulations of rivaroxaban 20 mg in healthy Mexican volunteers under fed 
      conditions. This phase I, single-blind, single-dose, randomized, two-sequence, 
      two-period crossover study included 32 volunteers. Subjects were randomly 
      assigned to one of two sequences: test formulation (single 20 mg dose) in the 
      first period followed by the reference formulation (single 20 mg dose) in the 
      second, or vice versa. Blood samples were collected predose and at predefined 
      timepoints across a 48-hour period after drug intake. Rivaroxaban plasma 
      concentrations were measured using a validated high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
      included maximum plasma concentration (C(max) ), area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve from time zero to last measurable concentration and to 
      infinity (AUC(0-t) , AUC(0-∞) ), time to reach C(max) , and half-life. Safety was 
      evaluated through adverse-event monitoring using subject interviews and recording 
      of vital signs. The 90% confidence intervals for the test/reference geometric 
      mean ratios of C(max) (100.4%-112.7%), AUC(0-t) (96.5%-111.6%), and AUC(0-∞) 
      (95.5%-109.5%) were within the bioequivalence acceptance range (80-125%). Two 
      adverse events (headaches) were recorded. Both formulations of rivaroxaban 20 mg 
      tablets were bioequivalent and well tolerated in a healthy population of Mexican 
      volunteers under fed conditions.

AB  - The present drug-drug interaction study investigates whether single or repeated 
      doses of 240 mg Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761(®) alter the pharmacokinetics or 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in healthy subjects. This was a single-centre, 
      two-period, fixed-sequence trial. In Period 1, rivaroxaban was taken alone. In 
      Period 2, rivaroxaban was given on the first and last of 8 days of EGb 761(®) 
      treatment. Plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban and anti-Factor Xa activity were 
      determined until 48 h after each rivaroxaban intake. The data of forty-one 
      healthy subjects (25 males, 16 females) aged 21-70 years were evaluable. 
      Geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) for rivaroxaban administered 
      concomitantly with a single or multiple doses of EGb 761(®) vs. rivaroxaban 
      administered alone were 97.97 (91.78, 104.58) and 96.78 (90.67, 103.31) for 
      maximum concentration (C(max)), 98.55 (94.43, 102.84) and 97.82 (93.73, 102.08) 
      for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-∞)) of rivaroxaban in plasma 
      (primary endpoints), 98.19 (92.00, 104.80) and 99.78 (93.43, 106.55) for maximum 
      effect (E(max)), 99.46 (93.63, 105.66) and 99.12 (93.25, 105.35) for area under 
      the effect curve (AUEC(0-48)). All 90% confidence intervals were within the 
      prespecified range of 80%-125%. Neither adverse events related to haemorrhages 
      nor clinically significant findings in haematology or coagulation parameters were 
      observed. The treatments were safe and well-tolerated. Single and repeated doses 
      of EGb 761® neither affect plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban nor anti-Factor 
      Xa activity in healthy subjects.

AB  - Rivaroxaban (RIV) is a direct Factor Xa inhibitor anticoagulant, but the oral 
      bioavailability of RIV is estimated to be only 60% due to its poor solubility. 
      The aim of the present study was to improve the solubility and bioavailability of 
      RIV. Five cocrystals-p-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA), 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid 
      (DBA), nicotinamide (NA), isonicotinamide (IA), and succinic acid (SA)-were used 
      as cofomers and were successfully obtained and characterized by powder X-ray 
      diffraction, thermal analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectra. RIV-DBA 
      and RIV-HBA cocrystals showed obvious improvements in solubility, dissolution 
      (under sink conditions), and intrinsic dissolution rates versus RIV. Moreover, 
      the dissolution of RIV-HBA, RIV-DBA, and RIV-SA cocrystals under non-sink 
      conditions showed obvious "spring and parachute" patterns. The in vitro 
      permeability levels in a Caco-2 cell model of RIV-DBA and RIV-IA cocrystals were 
      significantly improved versus RIV. Pharmacokinetic studies in beagle dogs showed 
      that RIV-DBA and RIV-HBA cocrystals had higher bioavailability than RIV. The 
      enhancements in solubility and bioavailability indicate the potential of RIV 
      cocrystals as a better candidate for the treatment of thrombosis versus RIV.

TI  - The Influence of ABCB1 (rs1045642 and rs4148738) Gene Polymorphisms on 
      Rivaroxaban Pharmacokinetics in Patients Aged 80 Years and Older with Nonvalvular 
      Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 469-480
LID - 10.1007/s40292-022-00536-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: ABCB1 gene polymorphisms are associated with rivaroxaban 
      distribution changes and adverse reactions but the data are controversial. AIM: 
      To evaluate the influence of ABCB1 (rs1045642 and rs4148738) gene polymorphisms 
      on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics in patients aged 80 years and older with 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NAF). METHODS: 128 patients aged 80 years and 
      older (median [Me] age 87.5 [83.0-90.0] years) with NAF were included. We 
      performed ABCB1 (rs1045642 and rs4148738) genotyping, measured the trough 
      steady-state plasma concentration (C(min,ss)) of rivaroxaban and prothrombin time 
      (PT) and analyzed prior medical records for clinically relevant non-major 
      bleeding (CRNMB). RESULTS: CC genotype carriers had no differences in C(min,ss) 
      (p > 0.05) compared with the CT and TT rs1045642 and rs4148738 genotypes 
      carriers. CC genotype carriers had no differences in PT (p > 0.05) compared with 
      the CT rs1045642 and rs4148738 and TT rs4148738 genotypes carriers. In the TT 
      genotype PT levels were higher than in the CC rs1045642 genotype: Me 14.2 
      [13.0-16.1] sec vs 13.3 [12.4-14.5] sec (p = 0.049). Incidence of CRNMB was 
      higher in patients with the TT genotype compared with the CC rs1045642 (29.3% vs 
      4.5%, p = 0.021) and rs4148738 (39.3% vs 8.1%, p = 0.008) and the CT genotype 
      rs4148738 (39.3% vs 14.3%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: ABCB1 (rs1045642 and 
      rs4148738) polymorphisms didn't influence rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics in 
      patients aged 80 years and older with NAF. TT carriers developed CRNMB more 
      frequently compared with the CC rs1045642 and the CC and CT rs4148738 genotypes. 
      The haplotype TT-TT haplotype was associated with a higher frequency of CRNMB.

AB  - Therapeutic drug monitoring is critical to decrease the incidence rate of 
      bleeding and thrombosis for personalized treatment with rivaroxaban, especially 
      for drug interaction treatment, patients with renal dysfunction, elderly 
      patients, patients with cardiovascular problems, and so on. In addition, an 
      accurate analytical method is necessary for therapeutic drug monitoring. This 
      study developed a ultra-HPLC-tandem Orbitrap high-resolution MS (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap 
      HRMS) method to accurately identify and quantify rivaroxaban in rat plasma. The 
      isotope internal standard method was applied for accurate quantification. 
      Rivaroxaban-d(4) was selected as the isotope internal standard substance. The m/z 
      436.07263 ([M + H](+) ) was selected as the precursor ion and m/z 144.95085 and 
      m/z 231.11259 were selected as the main product ions for rivaroxaban. The lower 
      limit of quantification of rivaroxaban in plasma was 0.01 mg/L. The intra- and 
      inter-day precisions were ≤3.65% and ≤8.16%, while the recoveries ranged from 
      87.4% to 95.2%. This analysis method was simple, low cost, and easy to operate. 
      The developed and validated method was subsequently applied to successfully 
      investigate the pharmacokinetic parameters of rivaroxaban in rats after its oral 
      administration. These results could be helpful to promote further research 
      regarding the mechanisms of rivaroxaban and drug interaction, which can avoid 
      false positives due to high-precision identification of the proposed method.

      Rivaroxaban in Thai Patients with Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation.

AB  - Low-dose rivaroxaban has been used in Asian patients with direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) eligible for atrial fibrillation (AF). However, there are 
      few pharmacokinetic (PK) data in Thai patients to support precise dosing. This 
      study aimed to develop a population PK model and determine the optimal 
      rivaroxaban doses in Thai patients. A total of 240 Anti-Xa levels of rivaroxaban 
      from 60 Thai patients were analyzed. A population PK model was established using 
      the nonlinear mixed-effect modeling approach. Monte Carlo simulations were used 
      to predict drug exposures at a steady state for various dosages. Proportions of 
      patients having rivaroxaban exposure within typical exposure ranges were 
      determined. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption best described 
      the data. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) and body weight significantly affected CL/F 
      and V/F, respectively. Regardless of body weight, a higher proportion of patients 
      with CrCl < 50 mL/min receiving the 10-mg once-daily dose had rivaroxaban 
      exposures within the typical exposure ranges. In contrast, a higher proportion of 
      patients with CrCl ≥ 50 mL/min receiving the 15-mg once-daily dose had 
      rivaroxaban exposures within the typical exposure ranges. The study’s findings 
      suggested that low-dose rivaroxaban would be better suited for Thai patients and 
      suggested adjusting the medication’s dose in accordance with renal function.

AB  - Cancer patients generally has a high risk of thrombotic diseases. However, 
      anticoagulant therapy always aggravates bleeding risks. Rivaroxaban is one of the 
      most widely used direct oral anticoagulants, which is used as anticoagulant 
      treatment or prophylaxis in clinical practice. The present study aimed to 
      systemically estimate the combination safety of rivaroxaban with tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors (TKIs) based on human cytochrome P450 (CYPs) and efflux transporters 
      and to explore the drug-drug interaction (DDI) mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. 
      In vivo pharmacokinetic experiments and in vitro enzyme incubation assays and 
      bidirectional transport studies were conducted. Imatinib significantly increased 
      the rivaroxaban C(max) value by 90.43% (p < 0.05) and the area under the curve 
      value by 119.96% (p < 0.01) by inhibiting CYP2J2- and CYP3A4-mediated metabolism 
      and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)- and P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated 
      efflux transportation in the absorption phase. In contrast, the combination of 
      sunitinib with rivaroxaban reduced the exposure in vivo by 62.32% (p < 0.05) and 
      the C(max) value by 72.56% (p < 0.05). In addition, gefitinib potently inhibited 
      CYP2J2- and CYP3A4-mediated rivaroxaban metabolism with K(i) values of 2.99 μΜ 
      and 4.91 μΜ, respectively; however, it almost did not affect the pharmacokinetics 
      of rivaroxaban in vivo. Taken together, clinically significant DDIs were observed 
      in the combinations of rivaroxaban with imatinib and sunitinib. Imatinib 
      increased the bleeding risks of rivaroxaban, while sunitinib had a risk of 
      reducing therapy efficiency. Therefore, more attention should be paid to aviod 
      harmful DDIs in the combinations of rivaroxaban with TKIs.

TI  - Rivaroxaban Pharmacokinetics in Obese Subjects: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 1677-1695
LID - 10.1007/s40262-022-01160-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of morbidity and 
      mortality globally. The direct oral anticoagulants, including rivaroxaban, are 
      relatively novel therapeutic options in the treatment and prevention of VTE. 
      There is a conflicting and inconclusive evidence surrounding the pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) of rivaroxaban in patients with VTE who are obese. OBJECTIVES: We conducted 
      a systematic review to provide an overview, and to synthesize the available 
      evidence in the current literature pertaining to rivaroxaban PK in obese subjects 
      who are healthy or diseased. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, Rayyan, 
      and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched from 1 May 2021 
      through 28 February 2022. Studies investigating rivaroxaban PK in adult obese 
      subjects were included in the review. Pertinent data, including anthropometric 
      parameters, rivaroxaban dosage regimen, PK parameters, PK model, and outcome 
      measures were extracted. Reference values of rivaroxaban PK parameters in the 
      general population were used for comparison purposes. The review protocol was 
      registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020177770). RESULTS: In the 11 studies 
      included in this systematic review, over 7140 healthy or diseased subjects 
      received rivaroxaban therapy, with varying clinical indications in the diseased 
      population. The reported PK parameters of rivaroxaban in obese subjects compared 
      with reference values in the general population were variable. The reported 
      values of the volume of distribution (V(d)) among obese subjects (73.4-82.8 L) 
      fell within the range of values reported/calculated for the general population 
      (59.4-104 L), assuming complete bioavailability. However, some of the reported 
      values of clearance (CL) in obese subjects (7.86-16.8 L.h(-1)) do not fall within 
      the range of values reported/calculated for the general population 
      (5.57-11.3 L.h(-1)). The reported maximum plasma concentrations in obese subjects 
      versus the general population following a 10 mg dose were 149 vs. 143-180 
      µg.L(-1), and following a 20 mg dose were 214-305 vs. 299-360 µg.L(-1), 
      respectively. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curves (AUC) 
      over different intervals in obese subjects versus the general population 
      following a 10 mg dose were 1155 (AUC from time zero to infinity [AUC(∞)]) vs. 
      1029 (AUC(∞)) µg.h.L(-1); and 1204-2800 (AUC from time zero to 24 h [AUC(24)]) 
      vs. 3200 (AUC(24)) µg.h.L(-1), respectively, following a 20 mg dose. The reported 
      values of half-life and time to reach the maximum plasma concentration in obese 
      subjects versus the general population were not consistent across studies. 
      CONCLUSION: Variable changes and inconsistencies in different rivaroxaban PK 
      parameters were reported in obese subjects. Further well-designed studies are 
      warranted to better characterize the PK and clinical outcomes of rivaroxaban in 
      subjects with obesity.

TI  - Eight pharmacokinetic genetic variants are not associated with the risk of 
      bleeding from direct oral anticoagulants in non-valvular atrial fibrillation 
      patients.

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the leading cause of ischemic stroke and 
      treatment has focused on reducing this risk through anticoagulation. Direct Oral 
      Anticoagulants (DOACs) are the first-line guideline-recommended therapy since 
      they are as effective and overall safer than warfarin in preventing AF-related 
      stroke. Although patients bleed less from DOACs compared to warfarin, bleeding 
      remains the primary safety concern with this therapy. Hypothesis: Genetic 
      variants known to modify the function of metabolic enzymes or transporters 
      involved in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of DOACs could increase the risk of 
      bleeding. Aim: To assess the association of eight, functional PK-related single 
      nucleotide variants (SNVs) in five genes (ABCB1, ABCG2, CYP2J2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5) 
      with the risk of bleeding from DOACs in non-valvular AF patients. Methods: A 
      retrospective cohort study was carried out with 2,364 self-identified white 
      non-valvular AF patients treated with either rivaroxaban or apixaban. Genotyping 
      was performed with Illumina Infinium CoreExome v12.1 bead arrays by the Michigan 
      Genomics Initiative biobank. The primary endpoint was a composite of major and 
      clinically relevant non-major bleeding. Cox proportional hazards regression with 
      time-varying analysis assessed the association of the eight PK-related SNVs with 
      the risk of bleeding from DOACs in unadjusted and covariate-adjusted models. The 
      pre-specified primary analysis was the covariate-adjusted, additive genetic 
      models. Six tests were performed in the primary analysis as three SNVs are in the 
      same haplotype, and thus p-values below the Bonferroni-corrected level of 8.33e-3 
      were considered statistically significant. Results: In the primary analysis, none 
      of the SNVs met the Bonferroni-corrected level of statistical significance (all p 
      > 0.1). In exploratory analyses with other genetic models, the ABCB1 (rs4148732) 
      GG genotype tended to be associated with the risk of bleeding from rivaroxaban 
      [HR: 1.391 (95%CI: 1.019-1.900); p = 0.038] but not from apixaban (p = 0.487). 
      Conclusion: Eight functional PK-related genetic variants were not significantly 
      associated with bleeding from either rivaroxaban or apixaban in more than 2,000 
      AF self-identified white outpatients.

TI  - Development and verification of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of 
      dronedarone and its active metabolite N-desbutyldronedarone: Application to 
      prospective simulation of complex drug-drug interaction with rivaroxaban.
PG  - 1873-1890
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15670 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Despite potential enzyme- and transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions 
      (DDIs) between dronedarone and rivaroxaban in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data remain limited to guide clinical practice. 
      We aimed to develop, verify and validate a physiologically based pharmacokinetic 
      (PBPK) model of dronedarone and its major metabolite, N-desbutyldronedarone 
      (NDBD), to prospectively interrogate this clinically relevant DDI in healthy and 
      mild renal impairment populations. METHODS: The middle-out development of our 
      PBPK model combined literature-derived or in-house in vitro data, predicted in 
      silico data and in vivo clinical data. Model verification was performed for 
      intravenous and oral (single and multiple) dosing regimens. Model validation for 
      the accurate prediction of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4- and P-glycoprotein-mediated 
      DDI utilized simvastatin and digoxin as respective victim drugs. 
      Rivaroxaban-specific inhibitory parameters of dronedarone and/or NDBD against 
      CYP3A4, CYP2J2, OAT3 and P-glycoprotein were incorporated into the PBPK-DDI model 
      for prospective dronedarone-rivaroxaban DDI simulation. RESULTS: Dronedarone and 
      NDBD PK following clinically relevant doses of 400 mg dronedarone across single 
      and multiple oral dosing were accurately simulated by incorporating effect of 
      auto-inactivation on dose nonlinearities. Following successful model validation, 
      nondose-adjusted rivaroxaban-dronedarone DDI in healthy and mild renal impairment 
      populations revealed simulated rivaroxaban area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve up to 24 h fold change greater than dose exposure 
      equivalence (0.70-1.43) at 1.65 and 1.84, respectively. Correspondingly, 
      respective major bleeding risk was 4.24 and 4.70% compared with threshold of 4.5% 
      representing contraindicated rivaroxaban-ketoconazole DDI. CONCLUSION: Our 
      PBPK-DDI model predicted clinically significant dronedarone-rivaroxaban DDI in 
      both healthy and mild renal impairment subjects. Greater benefit vs. risk could 
      be achieved with rivaroxaban dose reductions to at least 15 mg in mild renal 
      impairment subjects on concomitant dronedarone and rivaroxaban.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of a microdosed cocktail of three direct oral anticoagulants in 
      children with congenital heart defects: study protocol for a single-centre 
      clinical trial (DOAC-Child).
LID - 10.1136/bmjpo-2022-001662 [doi]
LID - e001662
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are direct inhibitors of 
      coagulation factor Xa and are frequently used in adults for different indications 
      such as deep vein thrombosis or non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Paediatric 
      patients might benefit as well from DOACs because the simplicity and convenience 
      of their use is likely to decrease physical and psychological stress related to 
      invasive procedures associated with phenprocoumon and heparin therapy. Thus, it 
      is expected that the future use of DOACs will ultimately improve compliance and 
      overall safety of anticoagulant therapies in paediatric populations. To assure 
      safe and effective use the clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      these drugs need to be evaluated in children. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is 
      a single-centre, open-label, clinical trial in a paediatric population with 
      non-cyanotic congenital heart defects. After having obtained informed consent 
      from the parents, each participant will receive a single oral administration of a 
      drinkable solution of a microdose cocktail of three FXa inhibitors consisting of 
      apixaban (12.5 µg), rivaroxaban (12.5 µg), edoxaban (50 µg), plus a microdose of 
      the two probe drugs midazolam (10 µg) and yohimbine (25 µg). Serial blood samples 
      (n=up to 20) will be collected at specified time points before and up to 25 hours 
      after cocktail administration. The primary PK endpoint will be the area under the 
      plasma concentration time curve of apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban. Secondary 
      PK outcomes will be C(max), t(max), t(1/2), Cl/F and V(ss)/F. Safety and 
      tolerability of the microdose cocktail will be evaluated as well by a collection 
      of adverse events. ETHICS: This study has been approved by the responsible Ethics 
      Committee of the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University. DISSEMINATION: Study 
      results will be presented at international scientific meetings and published in 
      peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: EudraCT 2019-001759-38 16, 
      DRKS00021455.

TI  - Insights into the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Direct Oral 
      Anticoagulants in Older Adults with Atrial Fibrillation: A Structured Narrative 
      Review.
PG  - 351-373
LID - 10.1007/s40262-023-01222-w [doi]
AB  - Older adults, the fastest growing population, represent almost 50% of all users 
      of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Unfortunately, we have very little 
      relevant pharmacological and clinical data on DOACs, especially in older adults 
      with geriatric profiles. This is highly relevant as pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) often differ substantially in this population. Hence, we 
      need to obtain a better understanding of the PK/PD of DOACs in older adults, to 
      ensure appropriate treatment. This review summarises the current insights into 
      PK/PD of DOACs in older adults. A search was undertaken up to October 2022 to 
      identify PK/PD studies of apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, that 
      included older adults aged ≥ 75 years. This review identified 44 articles. Older 
      age alone did not influence exposure of edoxaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran, 
      while apixaban peak concentrations were 40% higher in older adults than in young 
      volunteers. Nevertheless, high interindividual variability in DOAC exposure in 
      older adults was noted, which can be explained by distinctive older patient 
      characteristics, such as kidney function, changes in body composition (especially 
      reduced muscle mass), and co-medication with P-gp inhibitors, which is in line 
      with the current dosing reduction criteria of apixaban, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban. Dabigatran had the largest interindividual variability among all 
      DOACs since its dose adjustment criterion is only age, and thus it is not a 
      preferable option. Additionally, DOAC exposure, which fell outside of on-therapy 
      ranges, was significantly related to stroke and bleeding events. No definite 
      thresholds linked to these outcomes in older adults have been established.

      compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of two rivaroxaban formulations after a 
      single dose of rivaroxaban (2.5-mg tablet) in healthy Korean subjects. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: This study was a randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-period, 
      crossover study that included 34 healthy adult subjects under fasting conditions. 
      The test drug (Yuhan rivaroxaban tablet) or reference drug (Xarelto tablet) was 
      administered in each period. Serial blood samples were collected up to 36 hours 
      post-dose. Plasma concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS. Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters, including maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the 
      plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable 
      concentration (AUC(t)), were determined by non-compartmental analysis. The 90% 
      confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio of the geometric means of C(max) and 
      AUC(t) for the test drug/reference drug were calculated to evaluate 
      pharmacokinetic equivalence. RESULTS: A total of 28 subjects were included in the 
      pharmacokinetic analysis. The geometric mean ratios (90% CI) of the test 
      drug/reference drug for rivaroxaban were 1.0140 (0.9794 - 1.0499) for AUC(t) and 
      0.9350 (0.8797 - 0.9939) for C(max). All adverse events (AEs) were mild, and 
      there was no significant difference in the incidence of AEs between the 
      formulations. CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetic parameters of rivaroxaban were 
      compared between the test and reference drug, and both formulations were 
      bioequivalent. The newly developed rivaroxaban tablet is safe and well tolerated 
      as the reference drug (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT05418803).

TI  - Dabigatran Dosing Proposal for Adults With Atrial Fibrillation: Stress-Testing 
      Renal Function Range in Real World Patients.
PG  - 362-370
LID - 10.1002/cpt.2902 [doi]
AB  - Dabigatran is the first of four direct-acting oral anticoagulants approved to 
      prevent stroke in adult patients with atrial fibrillation using a fixed two-dose 
      scheme compared with warfarin dosing adjusted to a prothrombin time range 
      associated with optimal risk reduction in stroke and serious bleeding. The 
      pivotal phase III trial found dabigatran, depending on dose, is superior to 
      warfarin in stroke reduction and similar in bleeding risk while also showing 
      dabigatran efficacy and safety correlate with steady-state plasma concentrations. 
      Because the relationship between dabigatran dose and plasma concentration is 
      highly variable, a previously developed population pharmacokinetic model of over 
      9,000 clinical trial patients was used as a basis for simulations comparing the 
      performance of dosing via the drug label to other proposed doses and regimens. 
      Assessment of dosing regimen performance was based on simulations of trough 
      plasma levels within the therapeutic concentration range of 75-150 ng/mL over a 
      renal function range of 15-250 mL/min creatinine clearance, representing extremes 
      for real-world patients. An improved regimen that best achieves this therapeutic 
      range was identified, requiring five different dosing schedules, corresponding to 
      specified renal function ranges, compared with the two approved in the label. The 
      discussion focuses on how this information could better inform patient outcomes 
      and future dabigatran development.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetics of Rivaroxaban in Real-World Patients.
PG  - 943-949

AB  - The pharmacokinetics (PK) of rivaroxaban have been studied in different 
      populations, and there were differences in the PK parameters. However, most of 
      these studies were conducted on healthy subjects from different ethnic groups. 
      Thus, this study aimed to investigate the PK of rivaroxaban in real-world 
      patients to determine the covariates that may cause differences in the 
      pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. This was a prospective observational study. Five 
      blood samples were collected at different time points after starting the 
      rivaroxaban dose. Plasma concentrations were analyzed, and population PK models 
      were developed using Monolix version 4.4 software. In total, 100 blood samples 
      from 20 patients (50% men/50% women) were analyzed. The patients' mean (±standard 
      deviation) age was 53.1 (±15.5) years and their mean body weight was 81.7 
      (±27.2) kg. The PK of rivaroxaban were described by a 1-compartment model. The 
      initial estimates for the absorption rate constant, apparent clearance (CL/F), 
      and apparent volume of distribution were 1.8/h, 4.46 L/h, and 21.7 L, 
      respectively. The interindividual variability for absorption rate constant, CL/F, 
      and volume of distribution was 14%, 24%, and 29.3%, respectively. Covariates were 
      tested for their influence on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics. The aspartate 
      aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, body mass index, and albumin 
      concentrations had an effect on the CL/F of rivaroxaban. In this analysis, the 
      population PK model of rivaroxaban found significant interindividual variability. 
      Several covariates influenced the clearance of rivaroxaban and contributed to 
      this variability. The results may provide a guide that can aid the clinician 
      during the initiation and adjustment of therapeutic regimens.

AB  - This study compared the safety, bioequivalence, and pharmacokinetic properties of 
      2 formulations of 10-mg rivaroxaban tablets in healthy Chinese participants in 
      fasting and fed arms. The trial was an open, randomized, 4-period, replicated 
      crossover scheme, and 36 volunteers were recruited separately for the fasting and 
      fed arms. Volunteers were randomly administered a single dose of the test or 
      reference formulation (10 mg) orally, followed by a 5-day washout period. 
      Rivaroxaban concentrations in the plasma were determined using liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      obtained from the concentration-time profiles. The mean values of the test and 
      the reference product for the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 
      time 0 to the last measurable concentration, area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity, and maximum plasma 
      concentration were 996 and 1014 ng • h/mL, 1024 and 1055 ng • h/mL, and 150 and 
      152 ng/mL in the fasting arm, respectively; the values were 1155 and 1167 ng • 
      h/mL, 1160 and 1172 ng • h/mL, and 202 and 193 ng/mL in the fed arm, 
      respectively. All the parameters were within acceptable limits in terms of 
      bioequivalence. No serious adverse events were observed. This study demonstrated 
      that the 2 rivaroxaban tablets were bioequivalent in healthy Chinese participants 
      under fasting and fed conditions.

TI  - Application of the Population Pharmacokinetics Model-Based Approach to the 
      Prediction of Drug-Drug Interaction between Rivaroxaban and Carbamazepine in 
      Humans.
LID - 10.3390/ph16050684 [doi]
LID - 684
AB  - Rivaroxaban (RIV) is one of the direct oral anticoagulants used to prevent and 
      treat venous and arterial thromboembolic events. Considering the therapeutic 
      indications, RIV is likely to be concomitantly administered with various other 
      drugs. Among these is carbamazepine (CBZ), one of the recommended first-line 
      options to control seizures and epilepsy. RIV is a strong substrate of cytochrome 
      P450 (CYP) enzymes and Pgp/BCRP efflux transporters. Meanwhile, CBZ is well known 
      as a strong inducer of these enzymes and transporters. Therefore, drug-drug 
      interaction (DDI) between CBZ and RIV is expected. This study aimed to predict 
      the DDI profile of CBZ and RIV in humans by using a population pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) model-based approach. We previously investigated the population PK 
      parameters of RIV administered alone or with CBZ in rats. In this study, those 
      parameters were extrapolated from rats to humans by using simple allometry and 
      liver blood flow scaling, and then applied to back-simulate the PK profiles of 
      RIV in humans (20 mg RIV per day) used alone or with CBZ (900 mg CBZ per day). 
      Results showed that CBZ significantly reduced RIV exposure. The AUC(inf) and 
      C(max) of RIV decreased by 52.3% and 41.0%, respectively, following the first RIV 
      dose, and by 68.5% and 49.8% at the steady state. Therefore, the 
      co-administration of CBZ and RIV warrants caution. Further studies investigating 
      the extent of DDIs between these drugs should be conducted in humans to fully 
      understand their safety and effects.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is a direct inhibitor of factor Xa, a member of direct oral 
      anticoagulant group of drugs (DOACs). Despite being a widely extended alternative 
      to vitamin K antagonists (i.e., acenocoumarol, warfarin) the interindividual 
      variability of DOACs is significant, and may be related to adverse drug reaction 
      occurrence or drug inefficacy, namely hemorrhagic or thromboembolic events. Since 
      there is not a consistent analytic practice to monitor the anticoagulant activity 
      of DOACs, previously reported polymorphisms in genes coding for proteins 
      responsible for the activation, transport, or metabolism of DOACs were studied. 
      The study population comprised 60 healthy volunteers, who completed two 
      randomized, crossover bioequivalence clinical trials between two different 
      rivaroxaban formulations. The effect of food, sex, biogeographical origin and 55 
      variants (8 phenotypes and 47 single nucleotide polymorphisms) in drug 
      metabolizing enzyme genes (such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, NAT2) and transporters 
      (namely, ABCB1, ABCG2) on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics was tested. Individuals 
      dosed under fasting conditions presented lower t(max) (2.21 h vs 2.88 h, 
      β = 1.19, R(2) =0.342, p = 0.012) compared to fed volunteers. NAT2 slow 
      acetylators presented higher AUC(∞) corrected by dose/weight (AUC(∞)/DW; 8243.90 
      vs 7698.20 and 7161.25 h*ng*mg /ml*kg, β = 0.154, R(2) =0.250, p = 0.044), higher 
      C(max)/DW (1070.99 vs 834.81 and 803.36 ng*mg /ml*kg, β = 0.245, R(2) =0.320, 
      p = 0.002), and lower t(max) (2.63 vs 3.19 and 4.15 h, β = -0.346, R(2) =0.282, 
      p = 0.047) than NAT2 rapid and intermediate acetylators. No other association was 
      statistically significant. Thus, slow NAT2 appear to have altered rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics, increasing AUC(∞) and C(max). Nonetheless, further research 
      should be conducted to verify NAT2 involvement on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics 
      and to determine its clinical significance.

TI  - Mutant CYP3A4/5 Correlated with Clinical Outcomes by Affecting Rivaroxaban 
      Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 1315-1325
LID - 10.1007/s10557-023-07495-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to investigate the impact of single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism-encoded cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4/5) on clinical outcomes of 
      rivaroxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) based on 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) aspects. METHOD: A prospective 
      study enrolling 165 rivaroxaban-treated patients with NVAF was conducted. 
      Genotyping of CYP3A4 (rs2242480, rs2246709, rs3735451, and rs4646440) and CYP3A5 
      (rs776746) was performed to explore their impact on the trough plasma 
      concentrations (C(trough)) of rivaroxaban, coagulation indicators at the 
      C(trough) including activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin 
      time (PT), and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Patients with mutant genotype CYP3A4 
      (rs2242480, rs2246709, and rs3735451) and CYP3A5 (rs776746) had higher levels of 
      rivaroxaban C(trough), PT values than that of wild-type. Furthermore, a positive 
      relationship was revealed between C(trough) and PT (r = 0.212, p = 0.007), while 
      no significant correlation was found between C(trough) and APTT. Regarding the 
      clinical outcomes, the minor allele carriers on rs3735451 and the minor allele 
      (A) carriers on rs2246709 were associated with higher incidence of minor bleeding 
      (p = 0.028 and p = 0.038, respectively) and were identified as the independent 
      risk factors of minor bleeding treated with rivaroxaban (p = 0.024 and p = 0.036, 
      respectively), with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve validated 
      (AUC = 0.8956, 95% CI: 0.829-0.962). CONCLUSION: The CYP3A4 polymorphisms 
      (rs2242480, rs2246709, and rs3735451) and CYP3A5 rs776746 were associated with 
      variations in rivaroxaban PK/PD. The minor allele (C) carriers on rs3735451 and 
      the minor allele (A) carriers on rs2246709 were correlated with clinical 
      outcomes.

TI  - Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with 
      Extremely Low and High Body Weight-Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12154969 [doi]
LID - 4969
AB  - Phase III clinical trials for individual direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      contained a limited representation of subjects with abnormal body weight, which 
      were mostly limited to a BMI > 40 kg/m(2), or body weight > 120 kg for obese 
      subjects, and <50 kg for underweight subjects. Although low or high body weight 
      is not a contraindication to DOACs therapy, it can significantly affect the 
      safety and effectiveness of treatment. Due to the limited amount of clinical data 
      on the use of DOACs in extremely abnormal weight ranges, optimal pharmacotherapy 
      in this group of patients is a matter of controversy. The objective of this study 
      was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of DOAC properties in patients with abnormal 
      body weight beyond the established cut-off points in the phase III studies for 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran. In total, 38 patients took DOACs for at 
      least 12 months for non-valvular atrial fibrillation in 2019-2021. Blood samples 
      were collected before the planned intake of the drug and 4 h after its 
      administration. The determined concentrations of DOACs were statistically 
      analyzed in relation to body weight, age, and eGFR (estimated Glomerular 
      Filtration Rate). Among subjects taking apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran, 
      the smallest representation of patients who achieved therapeutic concentrations 
      were those treated with dabigatran. The population of people with abnormal body 
      weight is a potential risk group of patients, in which some of them do not reach 
      the therapeutic range of DOACs.

TI  - Effects of rivaroxaban on myocardial mitophagy in the rat heart.
PG  - 301-308
LID - 10.5606/tgkdc.dergisi.2023.24385 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban's 
      pharmacokinetic effects on myocardial mitophagy in rats by inducing apoptosis. 
      METHODS: In this double-blind experiment, Wistar albino male rats were randomly 
      divided into three groups for an experimental ischemia model: the sham group 
      (Group 1; n=7), the control group (Group 2; n=7), and the drug group (Group 3; 
      n=7). Rivaroxaban was perorally administered with gavage at 2 mg/ kg/day for 28 
      days in Group 3. The heart was surgically exposed, and ischemia was achieved by 
      compressing the vessel around the proximal part of the left anterior descending 
      coronary artery for 10 min. The heart tissue was then transected, removed, and 
      morphologically and immunohistochemically examined under a light microscope. 
      RESULTS: Heart sections were immunohistochemically marked with caspase 3, caspase 
      9, APAF1, and Bcl-2 antibodies. Group 1 was compared to the rivaroxaban-treated 
      group, and the pathways inducing apoptosis was increased (caspase 3, caspase 9, 
      APAF1; p<0.015, p<0.004, and p<0.01, respectively) and Bcl-2, the molecule that 
      inhibits apoptosis, was decreased (p<0.01) in Group 3. CONCLUSION: The present 
      study provides an evidence that the mitophagy response is less in 
      rivaroxaban-treated rats, showing the protective effect of rivaroxaban against 
      acute ischemia. Rivaroxaban-treated rats may have reduced cell death in 
      cardiomyocytes during myocardial infarction and thus have reduced damage to the 
      heart tissue caused by myocardial infarction.

AB  - The effects of food on the pharmacokinetics (PKs) and safety of 10-mg rivaroxaban 
      tablets in healthy Chinese subjects were investigated from 1 bioequivalence 
      trial. The bioequivalence trial was designed as randomized, open-label, 
      2-sequence, 4-period crossover under both fasted and fed conditions. A total of 
      56 healthy subjects were enrolled, 62.5% were male. These subjects received a 
      single oral 10-mg dose of rivaroxaban with a 7-day washout between 4 periods. 
      Serial PK samples were collected and plasma concentrations were analyzed using 
      validated high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
      Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental methods. The BE 
      module of WinNonLin was used for statistical analysis of the maximum 
      concentration (C(max) ), the area under the concentration-time curve from zero to 
      the final measurable concentration (AUC(0-t) ), and the area under the 
      concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(0-∞) ) of rivaroxaban in 
      plasma. Compared with the fasted state, the C(max) , AUC(0-t) , and AUC(0-∞) of 
      rivaroxaban significantly increased by 47%, 28%, and 26%, respectively, with oral 
      administration of rivaroxaban 10 mg in the fed state. The incidence of adverse 
      events (AEs) was similar between the fasted and fed states, and no serious AEs 
      were observed. Food significantly increased the exposure to rivaroxaban 10 mg in 
      Chinese subjects.

AB  - Objective: This study's objective was to evaluate the effects of pharmacokinetic 
      and pharmacogenetic factors on major bleeding in patients with ACS and 
      non-valvular AF receiving combined antithrombotic therapy consisting of 
      rivaroxaban, clopidogrel, and aspirin as part of dual or triple therapy. Methods: 
      A prospective observational study was conducted in two PCI centers in Moscow, the 
      Russian Federation, from 2017 to 2018. One hundred patients with ACS and AF were 
      enrolled. Prospective follow-ups continued for 12 months. Results: A total of 36 
      patients experienced bleeding events, with 10 experiencing major bleeding based 
      on the BARC scale and 17 experiencing major bleeding based on the ISTH scale. The 
      following predictors associated with an increased number of major bleeding events 
      were identified: for the ISTH scale, a Css min. of rivaroxaban of >137 pg/mL 
      (5.94 OR, (95% CI, 3.13-12.99; p < 0.004)) and carriage of the T allelic variant 
      polymorphism ABCB1 rs4148738 (8.97 OR (95% CI, 1.48-14.49; p < 0.017)), as well 
      as for the BARC scale (5.76 OR (95% CI, 2.36-9.87; p < 0.018)). Conclusions: 
      Measuring residual steady-state rivaroxaban concentrations and determining the 
      carriage of the T allelic variant polymorphism ABCB1 rs4148738 may be applicable 
      to high-risk patients for subsequent antithrombotic therapy modification.

TI  - In vivo evaluation of the pharmacokinetic interactions between almonertinib and 
      rivaroxaban, almonertinib and apixaban.
PG  - 1263975
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2023.1263975 [doi]
LID - 1263975
AB  - Background: Almonertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), is commonly used as a first-line treatment 
      for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR T790M mutations. 
      Rivaroxaban and apixaban are a selective, direct factor Xa inhibitor used to 
      treat venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is a frequent complication of NSCLC. 
      Rivaroxaban and apixaban are substrates of CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP, whereas 
      almonertinib is an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. Rivaroxaban or apixaban are often 
      prescribed together with almonertinib in NSCLC patients, but clear information on 
      pharmacokinetic drug interaction is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to 
      unravel the extent of interactions between almonertinib-rivaroxaban and 
      almonertinib apixaban in rats, and whether the pharmacokinetic interaction can be 
      mitigated by rivaroxaban and apixaban dose adjustment. Methods: Rats were divided 
      into ten groups (n = 6) that received rivaroxaban (2 mg/kg) (group 1), apixaban 
      (0.5 mg/kg) (group 2), almonertinib (15 mg/kg) (group 3, group 4), almonertinib 
      with rivaroxaban (2 mg/kg) (group 5), almonertinib with rivaroxaban (1 mg/kg) 
      (group 6), almonertinib with apixaban (0.5 mg/kg) (group 7), almonertinib with 
      apixaban (0.25 mg/kg) (group 8), rivaroxaban (2 mg/kg) with almonertinib (group 
      9), apixaban (0.5 mg/kg) with almonertinib (group 10). The concentrations of 
      drugs were determined by an ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
      spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The levels of messenger RNA were determined using 
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results and 
      Discussion: The results indicate that almonertinib increased the C(max) and 
      AUC(0-t) of 2 mg/kg rivaroxaban by 3.30 and 3.60-fold, 1 mg/kg rivaroxaban by 
      1.28 and 1.90-fold. Almonertinib increased the C(max) and AUC(0-t) of 0.5 mg/kg 
      apixaban by 2.69 and 2.87-fold, 0.25 mg/kg apixaban by 2.19 and 2.06-fold. In 
      addition, rivaroxaban also increased systemic exposure to almonertinib. The 
      results of qRT-PCR showed that almonertinib reduced the expression of Cyp3a1 in 
      liver and intestine, and Abcb1a, Abcg2 in intestine and kidney. The 
      pharmacokinetic results suggest that it is important to take special care of the 
      interactions of these drugs in clinical applications.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in Chinese deep vein thrombosis 
      patients and the exposure simulation for dosing recommendation.
PG  - 3351-3362
LID - 10.1007/s00210-023-02798-7 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model for 
      rivaroxaban and establish a model-based dosing guideline tailored to Chinese 
      patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A nonlinear mixed-effects modeling 
      approach was employed using Phoenix NLME 7.0 software to construct the PPK model 
      for rivaroxaban. The PK of rivaroxaban was adequately characterized through a 
      one-compartment model. Monte Carlo simulations were employed to formulate dosing 
      guidelines applicable to different patient subgroups. Data from 60 Chinese DVT 
      patients yielded 217 rivaroxaban plasma concentrations for analysis. The apparent 
      clearance (CL/F) of rivaroxaban was found to be significantly influenced by the 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), identified as a major covariate. 
      Based on Monte Carlo simulations, for the acute DVT treatment, a regimen of 
      15 mg, 10 mg, or 5 mg twice daily was associated with the highest total 
      probability target attainment (PTA(total)) in patients with normal, mildly 
      impaired, or moderately impaired renal function, respectively. For the continued 
      DVT treatment, a regimen of 20 mg, 15 mg, or 5 mg once daily exhibited the 
      maximum PTA(total) in patients with normal, mildly impaired, or moderately 
      impaired renal function, respectively. The recommendation label dose achieved the 
      PK target in those with normal renal function. However, for patients with mild or 
      moderate renal impairment, dose adjustments below the label recommendation might 
      be necessary. The PPK model associated CL/F with the covariate eGFR. Utilizing 
      the PPK model, a dosage regimen table was constructed to offer tailored dosing 
      recommendations for Chinese DVT patients.

AB  - A direct oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban fails to prevent stroke and systemic 
      embolism in one-to-several percent of patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF), but the reasons are unknown. The study used semi-mechanistic 
      in vitro-in vivo prediction (IVIVP) modeling to explore the reasons for 
      ineffective thrombosis prevention in NVAF patients. Steady-state drug 
      concentrations in plasma were measured at 0 h (C(trough)), 3 h (C(3h)), and 12 h 
      post-dosing in thirty-four patients treated with 20 mg rivaroxaban daily. The 
      clinical data were compared against "virtual twins" generated with a novel IVIVP 
      model that combined drug dissolution modeling, mechanistic description of gastric 
      drug transit, and population pharmacokinetics defining the variability of drug 
      disposition. The nonresponders had significantly lower C(3h) and C(trough) than 
      the responders (p < 0.001) and the covariates included in the population 
      pharmacokinetic submodel did not fully explain this difference. Simulations 
      involving varied gastrointestinal parameters in the "virtual twins" revealed that 
      lower small intestinal effective permeability (P(eff)), rather than a slower 
      stomach emptying rate, could explain low rivaroxaban exposure in the 
      nonresponders. IVIVP modeling was effectively used for exploring pharmacotherapy 
      failure. Low P(eff), found as a major determinant of ineffective rivaroxaban 
      treatment, encourages further research to find (pato)physiological factors 
      influencing suboptimal absorption.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Geriatric patients who sustain hip fractures and are taking factor Xa 
      inhibitors (Xa-I) experience surgical delay. Our institution developed a 
      pharmacokinetic protocol to formally guide and expedite surgical timing for these 
      patients. The protocol is based on the patient's renal function and timing of 
      last Xa-I dose. For patients with impaired renal function, longer wait times are 
      recommended. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of this 
      protocol for patients with geriatric hip fracture taking Xa-I. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Level 1 trauma center. 
      PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 164 patients aged 65 and older who were taking 
      Xa-I before admission and underwent hip fracture surgery; 68 patients in the 
      Standard group (2014-2018) and 96 patients in the Expedited group (2020-2022, 
      after protocol implementation). INTERVENTION: Hip fracture surgery. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASUREMENTS: Time to surgery (TTS), transfusion rate, blood loss, 90-day 
      complication rates. RESULTS: The median TTS was significantly shorter in the 
      Expedited group (28.6 hours, interquartile range 21.3 hours) than in the Standard 
      group (44.8 hours, interquartile range 21.1 hours) (P < .001). There were no 
      differences in overall transfusion rates. Multivariable regression analysis 
      demonstrated that time to surgery was not predictive of transfusion rate in all 
      patients (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.02, P = .652). There were no differences in 
      blood loss or rates of 90-day complications. CONCLUSION: Geriatric patients with 
      hip fractures and taking factor Xa inhibitors may warrant earlier surgery without 
      an increased risk of transfusion or bleeding. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic 
      Level III.

TI  - Time Course of the Interaction Between Oral Short-Term Ritonavir Therapy with 
      Three Factor Xa Inhibitors and the Activity of CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 in 
      Healthy Volunteers.
PG  - 469-481
LID - 10.1007/s40262-024-01350-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the effect of a 5-day low-dose ritonavir therapy, as 
      it is used in the treatment of COVID-19 with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, on the 
      pharmacokinetics of three factor Xa inhibitors (FXaI). Concurrently, the time 
      course of the activities of the cytochromes P450 (CYP) 3A4, 2C19, and 2D6 was 
      assessed. METHODS: In an open-label, fixed sequence clinical trial, the effect 
      and duration of a 5-day oral ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) treatment on the 
      pharmacokinetics of three oral microdosed FXaI (rivaroxaban 25 µg, apixaban 
      25 µg, and edoxaban 50 µg) and microdosed probe drugs (midazolam 25 µg, yohimbine 
      50 µg, and omeprazole 100 µg) was evaluated in eight healthy volunteers. The 
      plasma concentrations of all drugs were quantified using validated liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods and pharmacokinetics 
      were analysed using non-compartmental analyses. RESULTS: Ritonavir increased the 
      exposure of apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, but to a different extent the 
      observed area under the plasma concentration-time curve (geometric mean ratio 
      1.29, 1.46, and 1.87, respectively). A strong CYP3A4 inhibition (geometric mean 
      ratio > 10), a moderate CYP2C19 induction 2 days after ritonavir (0.64), and no 
      alteration of CYP2D6 were observed. A CYP3A4 recovery half-life of 2.3 days was 
      determined. CONCLUSION: This trial with three microdosed FXaI suggests that at 
      most the rivaroxaban dose should be reduced during short-term ritonavir, and only 
      in patients receiving high maintenance doses. Thorough time series analyses 
      demonstrated differential effects on three different drug-metabolising enzymes 
      over time with immediate profound inhibition of CYP3A4 and only slow recovery 
      after discontinuation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT number: 
      2021-006643-39.

TI  - Novel Thiourea and Oxime Ether Isosteviol-Based Anticoagulants: MD Simulation and 
      ADMET Prediction.
LID - 10.3390/ph17020163 [doi]
LID - 163
AB  - Activated blood coagulation factor X (FXa) plays a critical initiation step of 
      the blood-coagulation pathway and is considered a desirable target for 
      anticoagulant drug development. It is reversibly inhibited by nonvitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, 
      and rivaroxaban. Thrombosis is extremely common and is one of the leading causes 
      of death in developed countries. In previous studies, novel thiourea and oxime 
      ether isosteviol derivatives as FXa inhibitors were designed through a 
      combination of QSAR studies and molecular docking. In the present contribution, 
      molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for 100 ns to assess binding 
      structures previously predicted by docking and furnish additional information. 
      Moreover, three thiourea- and six oxime ether-designed isosteviol analogs were 
      then examined for their drug-like and ADMET properties. MD simulations 
      demonstrated that four out of the nine investigated isosteviol derivatives, i.e., 
      one thiourea and three oxime ether ISV analogs, form stable complexes with FXa. 
      These derivatives interact with FXa in a manner similar to Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA)-approved drugs like edoxaban and betrixaban, indicating 
      their potential to inhibit factor Xa activity. One of these derivatives, E24, 
      displays favorable pharmacokinetic properties, positioning it as the most 
      promising drug candidate. This, along with the other three derivatives, can 
      undergo further chemical synthesis and bioassessment.

TI  - The Pharmacogenetic Variability Associated with the Pharmacokinetics and 
      Pharmacodynamics of Rivaroxaban in Healthy Chinese Subjects: A National 
      Multicenter Exploratory Study.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the pharmacogenetic variability associated 
      with the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of rivaroxaban in 
      healthy Chinese subjects. METHODS: This was a multicenter study that included 304 
      healthy adults aged 18 to 45 years with unknown genotypes. All participants were 
      administered a single dose of rivaroxaban at 10 mg, 15 mg, or 20 mg. PK and PD 
      parameters were measured, and exome-wide association analysis was conducted. 
      FINDINGS: Sixteen SNPs located on 11 genes influenced the AUC(0-t). Among these, 
      the 3 most influential genes were MiR516A2, PARP14, and MIR618. Thirty-six SNPs 
      from 28 genes were associated with the PD of rivaroxaban. The 3 most influential 
      genes were PKNOX2, BRD3, and APOL4 for anti-Xa activity, and GRIP2, PLCE1, and 
      MLX for diluted prothrombin time (dPT). Among them, BRD3 played an important role 
      in both the PK and PD of rivaroxaban. Anti-Xa activity (ng/mL) differed 
      significantly among subjects with BRD3 rs467387: 145.1 ± 55.5 versus 139.9 ± 65.1 
      versus 164.0 ± 68.6 for GG, GA, and AA carriers, respectively (P = 0.0002). 
      IMPLICATIONS: This study found that that the regulation of the BRD3 gene might 
      affect the PK and PD of rivaroxaban, suggesting that it should be studied as a 
      new pharmacologic target. The correlation between this gene locus and clinical 
      outcomes has yet to be verified in patients undergoing clinical treatment.

AB  - Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) typically exhibit a predictable 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic response at a fixed dose, not necessitating 
      monitoring under standard conditions. Yet, in specific clinical scenarios that 
      can impair it, like Congenital Nephrotic Syndrome (CNS) or Short Bowel Syndrome 
      (SBS) due to absorption issues, anti-thrombin III (AT-III) deficiency and 
      non-selective proteinuria, adjusting the dosage to achieve appropriate plasma 
      concentrations could prove beneficial. We report a 3-month-old female with 
      catheter-related jugular thrombosis affected by CNS concomitant to SBS and 
      failure of both treatments with heparin and warfarin, that was switched to 
      dose-adjusted pediatric rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban was adjusted to reach peak 
      levels between 189 and 419 ng/ml and the lower trough levels between 6 and 
      87 ng/ml. Increasing doses were needed due to SBS related malabsorption but a 
      complete permeabilization of the vein was achieved without bleeding 
      complications. The use of anti-Xa adjusted rivaroxaban could be an alternative to 
      improve anticoagulation and secondary thromboprophylaxis in pediatric patients 
      SBS and an option to children with CNS.

AB  - The evidence of rivaroxaban's pharmacokinetics in obese compared with non-obese 
      populations remains inconclusive. We aimed to compare the pharmacokinetic profile 
      of rivaroxaban between obese and non-obese populations under fed state. 
      Participants who met the study's eligibility criteria were assigned into one of 
      two groups: obese (body mass index ≥35 kg/m(2)) or non-obese (body mass index 
      18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)). A single dose of rivaroxaban 20 mg was orally administered to 
      each participant. Nine blood samples over 48 h, and multiple urine samples over 
      18 h were collected and analyzed for rivaroxaban concentration using 
      ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass detector. 
      Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using WinNonlin software. Thirty-six 
      participants were recruited into the study. No significant changes were observed 
      between obese and non-obese participants in peak plasma concentration, time to 
      reach peak plasma concentration, area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      over 48 h or to infinity, elimination rate constant, half-life, apparent volume 
      of distribution, apparent clearance, and fraction of drug excreted unchanged in 
      urine over 18 h. Rivaroxaban's exposure was similar between the obese and 
      non-obese subjects, and there were no significant differences in other 
      pharmacokinetic parameters between the two groups. These results suggest that 
      dose adjustment for rivaroxaban is probably unwarranted in the obese population.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor. Its interindividual variability is 
      large and may be connected to the occurrence of adverse drug reactions or drug 
      inefficacy. Pharmacogenetics studies concentrating on the reasons underlying 
      rivaroxaban's inadequate response could help explain the differences in treatment 
      results and medication safety profiles. Against this background, this study 
      evaluated whether polymorphisms in the gene encoding the ABCG2 transporter modify 
      the pharmacokinetic characteristics of rivaroxaban. A total of 117 healthy 
      volunteers participated in two bioequivalence experiments with a single oral dose 
      of 20 mg rivaroxaban, with one group fasting and the other being fed. 
      Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was 
      employed to determine the plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban, and the WinNonlin 
      program was used to calculate the pharmacokinetics parameters. In the fasting 
      group, the rivaroxaban pharmacokinetic parameters of Vd (508.27 vs 334.45 vs 
      275.59 L) and t1/2 (41.04 vs 16.43 vs 15.47 h) were significantly higher in ABCG2 
      421 A/A genotype carriers than in ABCG2 421 C/C and 421 C/A genotype carriers 
      (P<0.05). The mean values of Cmax (145.81 vs 176.27 vs 190.19 ng/mL), AUC0-t 
      (1193.81 vs 1374.69 vs 1570.77 ng/mL·h), and Cl (11.82 vs 14.50 vs 13.01 mL/h) 
      for these groups were lower, but this difference was not statistically 
      significant (P>0.05). These findings suggested that the ABCG2 421 A/A genotype 
      may impact rivaroxaban parameters after a single dose in healthy subjects. This 
      finding must be validated before it is applied in clinical practice.

TI  - Exposure Matching-Based Pediatric Dose Selection for Drugs with Renal Excretion - 
      Lessons Learned from Pediatric Development of Direct Oral Anticoagulants.
PG  - 1174-1187
LID - 10.1002/cpt.3396 [doi]
AB  - The pediatric clinical development programs of the direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran have recently been completed, with 
      apixaban close to the finish line. One common pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristic 
      of these four DOACs is that renal excretion contributes 27% or more in their 
      elimination, resulting in age-dependent drug clearance in both pediatric and 
      adult subjects. Several lessons have been learned from adult exposure matching 
      and pediatric dose selection for DOACs. The main goal of this tutorial is to 
      provide an informed perspective on pediatric dose selection for renally excreted 
      drugs, using these four DOACs as case examples. This tutorial is organized into 
      seven steps: (1) consideration of age-related differences in disease and response 
      to treatment; (2) consideration of age-related differences in drug absorption, 
      distribution, metabolism, and excretion; (3) selection of the reference adult 
      population and exposure for pediatric exposure matching; (4) prediction of 
      pediatric clearance and pediatric dose selection based on data from young adults; 
      (5) conduct and design of efficient pediatric PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies 
      that inform dose selection; (6) assessment of exposure matching and dose 
      adjustment using population PK simulation; (7) evaluation of the need for dose 
      adjustment in pediatric sub-populations.

TI  - Rivaroxaban for stroke patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (RISAPS): protocol 
      for a randomized controlled, phase IIb proof-of-principle trial.
PG  - 102468
LID - 10.1016/j.rpth.2024.102468 [doi]
LID - 102468
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal secondary prevention antithrombotic therapy for patients with 
      antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)-associated ischemic stroke, transient ischemic 
      attack, or other ischemic brain injury is undefined. The standard of care, 
      warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists at standard or high intensity 
      (international normalized ratio (INR) target range 2.0-3.0/3.0-4.0, 
      respectively), has well-recognized limitations. Direct oral anticoagulants have 
      several advantages over warfarin, and the potential role of high-dose direct oral 
      anticoagulants vs high-intensity warfarin in this setting merits investigation. 
      OBJECTIVES: The Rivaroxaban for Stroke patients with APS trial (RISAPS) seeks to 
      determine whether high-dose rivaroxaban could represent a safe and effective 
      alternative to high-intensity warfarin in adult patients with APS and previous 
      ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or other ischemic brain 
      manifestations. METHODS: This phase IIb prospective, randomized, controlled, 
      noninferiority, open-label, proof-of-principle trial compares rivaroxaban 15 mg 
      twice daily vs warfarin, target INR range 3.0-4.0. The sample size target is 40 
      participants. Triple antiphospholipid antibody-positive patients are excluded. 
      The primary efficacy outcome is the rate of change in brain white matter 
      hyperintensity volume on magnetic resonance imaging, a surrogate marker of 
      presumed ischemic damage, between baseline and 24 months follow-up. Secondary 
      outcomes include additional neuroradiological and clinical measures of efficacy 
      and safety. Exploratory outcomes include high-dose rivaroxaban pharmacokinetic 
      modeling. CONCLUSION: Should RISAPS demonstrate noninferior efficacy and safety 
      of high-dose rivaroxaban in this APS subgroup, it could justify larger 
      prospective randomized controlled trials.

TI  - Co-Administration of Amiodarone Increases Bleeding by Affecting Rivaroxaban 
      Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics16081006 [doi]
LID - 1006
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the impact of the drug-drug interaction between 
      rivaroxaban and amiodarone on the clinical outcomes in patients with non-valvular 
      atrial fibrillation (NVAF), focusing on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      (PK/PD) aspects. A prospective study enrolling 174 patients with NVAF who were 
      treated with rivaroxaban was conducted. The patients were divided into two groups 
      based on postoperative antiarrhythmic and anticoagulation strategies: the 
      rivaroxaban group (Control group) and the rivaroxaban plus amiodarone group 
      (Riv/Amio group). The trough plasma concentrations (C(trough)) of rivaroxaban, 
      activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), and the 
      clinical outcomes between the two groups were compared. Patients receiving 20 mg 
      of rivaroxaban in the Riv/Amio group had a higher concentration of rivaroxaban 
      C(trough) than those in the Control group (p = 0.009). Furthermore, in patients 
      with moderate to severe renal impairment, rivaroxaban C(trough) was significantly 
      increased in the Riv/Amio group. There was no significant difference in PT and 
      APTT between the two groups. Regarding the clinical outcomes, the combination of 
      rivaroxaban and amiodarone medication was associated with a higher incidence of 
      bleeding events (p = 0.041; HR = 2.83, 95% CI 1.05-7.66) and clinically relevant 
      non-major bleeding (p = 0.021; HR = 3.65, 95% CI 1.21-10.94). Finally, 
      independent risk factors for bleeding in NAVF patients treated with rivaroxaban 
      were identified as its combination with amiodarone (p = 0.044; OR = 2.871, 95% CI 
      1.028-8.023). The combination of rivaroxaban and amiodarone led to changes in 
      rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and an elevated risk of bleeding events. Therefore, 
      physicians prescribing rivaroxaban medications should assess the potential 
      bleeding risk associated with the concurrent use of amiodarone, particularly in 
      patients with renal impairment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated 
      drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of kinase inhibitors with warfarin and 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). METHODS: An in vitro CYP probe substrate 
      cocktail assay was used to study the inhibitory effects of fifteen kinase 
      inhibitors on CYP2C9, 3A, and 1A2. Then, DDI predictions were performed using 
      both mechanistic static and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. 
      RESULTS: Linsitinib, masitinib, regorafenib, tozasertib, trametinib, and 
      vatalanib were identified as competitive CYP2C9 inhibitors (K(i) = 1.4, 1.0, 1.1, 
      3.8, 0.5, and 0.1 μM, respectively). Masitinib and vatalanib were competitive 
      CYP3A inhibitors (K(i) = 1.3 and 0.2 μM), and vatalanib noncompetitively 
      inhibited CYP1A2 (K(i) = 2.0 μM). Moreover, linsitinib and tozasertib were CYP3A 
      time-dependent inhibitors (K(I) = 26.5 and 400.3 μM, k(inact) = 0.060 and 0.026 
      min(-1), respectively). Only linsitinib showed time-dependent inhibition of 
      CYP1A2 (K(I) = 13.9 μM, k(inact) = 0.018 min(-1)). Mechanistic static models 
      identified possible DDI risks for linsitinib and vatalanib with 
      (S)-/(R)-warfarin, and for masitinib with (S)-warfarin. PBPK simulations further 
      confirmed that vatalanib may increase (S)- and (R)-warfarin exposure by 4.37- and 
      1.80-fold, respectively, and that linsitinib may increase (R)-warfarin exposure 
      by 3.10-fold. Mechanistic static models predicted a smaller risk of DDIs between 
      kinase inhibitors and apixaban or rivaroxaban. The greatest AUC increases 
      (1.50-1.74) were predicted for erlotinib in combination with apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban. Linsitinib, masitinib, and vatalanib were predicted to have a 
      smaller effect on apixaban and rivaroxaban AUCs (AUCR 1.22-1.53). No kinase 
      inhibitor was predicted to increase edoxaban exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      suggest that several kinase inhibitors, including vatalanib and linsitinib, can 
      cause CYP-mediated drug-drug interactions with warfarin and, to a lesser extent, 
      with apixaban and rivaroxaban. The work provides mechanistic insights into the 
      risk of DDIs between kinase inhibitors and anticoagulants, which can be used to 
      avoid preventable DDIs in the clinic.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Rivaroxaban is often used in combination with DHI to 
      treat thromboembolic disease. Whether the combination causing HDIs is still 
      unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects of DHI on 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in rats and effects on 
      CYP3A2. METHODS: Plasma concentration of rivaroxaban with or without DHI was 
      determined by HPLC. Pharmacokinetics parameters were calculated. Effect of DHI on 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban was investigated by APTT, PT, TT, FIB, INR, 
      length of tail thrombosis, vWF, t-PA, PAI-1, IL-1β, TNF-α and histopathological 
      sections. Effect of DHI on CYP3A2 in rats was investigated by probe drug method. 
      RESULTS: C(max) and AUC of rivaroxaban increased significantly in combination 
      group (P < 0.05). APTT, PT, INR and TT increased (P < 0.05), length of tail 
      thrombosis, FIB, vWF, PAI-1, IL-1β and TNF-α of combination group decreased 
      significantly (P < 0.05) compared with rivaroxaban or DHI alone. Histopathologic 
      section of tail thrombus had significant improvement. C(max) and AUC of dapsone 
      increased (P < 0.05) in DHI group. CONCLUSION: In summary, DHI is an inhibitor of 
      CYP3A2 and could significantly affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic of 
      rivaroxaban, enhance anticoagulant and antithrombotic efficacy in rats. However, 
      the combination of rivaroxaban and DHI might lead to potential HDIs. The dosage 
      of rivaroxaban should be adjusted in clinical.
