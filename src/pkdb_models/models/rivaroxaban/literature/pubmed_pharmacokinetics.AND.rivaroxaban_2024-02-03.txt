AB  - OBJECTIVE: Doses of 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg of rivaroxaban are approved for the 
      treatment and prevention of thromboembolic disorders in adult patients. In six 
      Phase I studies, the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 
      10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg rivaroxaban were investigated in healthy male subjects, 
      and the influence of food on these parameters was investigated for the 10 mg, 15 
      mg, and 20 mg tablet doses. In addition, an oral suspension containing 1 mg/ml 
      rivaroxaban, which is under investigation for future use in the pediatric 
      population, was investigated at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. MATERIALS: Rivaroxaban 
      was obtained from Bayer Pharma AG, Wuppertal, Germany. METHODS: Six independent, 
      single-dose, cross-over studies were performed in healthy male subjects (between 
      13 and 24 subjects were enrolled in each study) to determine the 
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of rivaroxaban under fasting and fed 
      conditions. Study 1 was an absolute bioavailability study that compared 5 mg and 
      20 mg tablet doses with a 1 mg intravenous solution. Studies 2 and 3 were 
      confirmatory food-effect studies that assessed 10 mg and 20 mg tablet doses, 
      respectively, under fed and fasting conditions. Study 4 was a formulation study 
      that evaluated oral suspensions of 10 mg (fasting) and 20 mg (fasting and fed) 
      rivaroxaban vs. a 10 mg tablet (fasted). Study 5 was a dose-proportionality study 
      that assessed 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg tablets under fasting conditions. Study 6 
      was a dose-proportionality study that assessed tablet doses of 10 mg, 15 mg, and 
      20 mg under fed conditions. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including the area under 
      the plasma concentration-time curve after a single dose, the maximum drug 
      concentration in plasma after a single dose, dose-adjusted values of area under 
      the plasma concentration-time curve and maximum drug concentration in plasma 
      after a single dose, half-life associated with the terminal slope, and time to 
      maximum concentration in plasma after a single dose were evaluated. Adverse 
      events were classified according to their degree of severity and were summarized 
      using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms. RESULTS: At 
      all doses, rivaroxaban showed an acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated 
      in healthy individuals. Independent of food and formulation, pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of doses up to 10 mg rivaroxaban were dose proportional and had high 
      oral bioavailability (≥ 80%). Under fasting conditions, pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of 15 mg and 20 mg rivaroxaban increased with dose but were less than 
      dose proportional. However, when taken with food, high bioavailability (≥ 80%) of 
      these doses was achieved independent of formulation. CONCLUSION: Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of doses up to 10 mg rivaroxaban were dose proportional and had high 
      oral bioavailability independent of food or whether administered as tablet or 
      solution. High bioavailability (≥ 80%) of 15 mg and 20 mg rivaroxaban was 
      achieved when taken with food; therefore, these doses need to be taken with food.

PG  - 911-923
LID - 10.1080/17425255.2023.2287472 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have overtaken vitamin K 
      antagonists to become the most widely used method of anticoagulation for most 
      indications. Their stable and predictable pharmacokinetics combined with 
      relatively simple dosing, and the absence of routine monitoring has made them an 
      attractive proposition for healthcare providers. Despite the benefits of DOACs as 
      a class, important differences exist between individual DOAC drugs in respect of 
      their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles with implications for dosing 
      and reversal in cases of major bleeding. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes 
      the state of knowledge relating to the pharmacokinetics of dabigatran (factor 
      IIa/thrombin inhibitor) and apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban (factor Xa) 
      inhibitors. We focus on pharmacokinetic differences between the drugs which may 
      have clinically significant implications. EXPERT OPINION: Patient-centered care 
      necessitates a careful consideration of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      differences between DOACs, and how these relate to individual patient 
      circumstances. Prescribers should be aware of the potential for pharmacokinetic 
      drug interactions with DOACs which may influence prescribing decisions in 
      patients with multiple comorbidities. In order to give an appropriate dose of 
      DOAC drugs, accurate estimation of renal function using the Cockcroft-Gault 
      formula using actual body weight is necessary. An increasing body of evidence 
      supports the use of DOACs in patients who are obese, and this is becoming more 
      routine in clinical practice.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban--an oral, direct factor Xa 
      inhibitor.
PG  - 75-83
AB  - Anticoagulants have a key role in the management of venous and arterial 
      thromboembolic disorders. Traditional anticoagulants, such as unfractionated 
      heparin, low-molecular-weight heparins, fondaparinux, and vitamin K antagonists 
      are effective but have limitations that make the management of thromboembolic 
      disorders difficult. There is a clear need for new anticoagulants that are at 
      least as effective as traditional agents but without their drawbacks. This review 
      discusses the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of one 
      of these newer agents - the direct Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban - and provides 
      an overview of the results of phase III clinical studies. Based on these results, 
      rivaroxaban has gained approval for the prevention and treatment of several 
      thromboembolic disorders in adult patients. Rivaroxaban, which has a rapid onset 
      of action, targets free and clot-bound Factor Xa and Factor Xa in the 
      prothrombinase complex. It reaches maximal plasma concentration 2-4 hours after 
      administration and has a high bioavailability (80-100%). Rivaroxaban has several 
      advantages over traditional anticoagulants. It does not require dose adjustment 
      for age, sex, body weight, or ethnicity, and there is no requirement for routine 
      coagulation monitoring because it has been shown to have predictable 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Furthermore, rivaroxaban has minimal food 
      and drug interactions. The introduction of newer oral anticoagulants, such as 
      rivaroxaban, that are convenient to administer and have predictable 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, could ultimately simplify patient 
      management in clinical practice and may improve clinical outcomes across a broad 
      range of thromboembolic disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban represents a selective direct inhibitor of activated 
      coagulation factor X (FXa) having peroral bioavailability and prompt onset of 
      action. OBJECTIVE: The absorbtion of rivaroxaban is quick, reaching maximum 
      plasma concentration 2-4 hours following its administration. Peroral 
      bioavailability is high (80-100 %) and pharmacokinetic variability is considered 
      to be moderate (coefficient of variation 30-40 %). This review discusses the 
      properties, drug interactions, pharmacokinetics and clinical indications of 
      rivaroxaban. METHOD: Dosing regimen of rivaroxaban was derived from pharmacologic 
      data of the development program aimed to gain strong antithrombotic drug and 
      balance between efficacy and risk of bleeding in patients. Results of doseranging 
      trials, pharmacokinetic models and randomised studies of phase III advocate the 
      use of such schemes in everyday practice. RESULTS: The drug has been manufactured 
      to fulfill clinical requirements in a variety of indications in adults: 
      prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) following elective knee or hip 
      replacement surgical intervention, therapy and secondary prophylaxis of VTE, 
      prophylaxis of ischemic stroke and embolism in individuals diagnosed with 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with risky characteristics, and in Europe 
      the prophylaxis of atherothrombotic episodes following an acute coronary syndrome 
      in subjects with increased levels of cardiac biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban 
      may offer benefit in many clinical situations. In comparison with low molecular 
      weight heparin and fondaparinux requiring subcutaneous way of administration, and 
      with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), which require regular monitoring of 
      international normalized ratio, rivaroxaban is relatively easy to use. However, 
      adjustments of dose are needed in individuals with impaired renal functions.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor that targets free and 
      clot-bound Factor Xa and Factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex. It is absorbed 
      rapidly, with maximum plasma concentrations being reached 2-4 h after tablet 
      intake. Oral bioavailability is high (80-100 %) for the 10 mg tablet irrespective 
      of food intake and for the 15 mg and 20 mg tablets when taken with food. 
      Variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters is moderate (coefficient of 
      variation 30-40 %). The pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban is consistent in 
      healthy subjects and across a broad range of different patient populations 
      studied. Elimination of rivaroxaban from plasma occurs with a terminal half-life 
      of 5-9 h in healthy young subjects and 11-13 h in elderly subjects. Rivaroxaban 
      produces a pharmacodynamic effect that is closely correlated with its plasma 
      concentration. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship for 
      inhibition of Factor Xa activity can be described by an E max model, and 
      prothrombin time prolongation by a linear model. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit 
      cytochrome P450 enzymes or known drug transporter systems and, because 
      rivaroxaban has multiple elimination pathways, it has no clinically relevant 
      interactions with most commonly prescribed medications. Rivaroxaban has been 
      approved for clinical use in several thromboembolic disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation, peripheral and coronary artery disease, and 
      venous thromboembolism are major risk factors for stroke, disability, and death 
      in the rapidly growing older (≥ 65 years.) population. In the absence of clear 
      guidelines on the appropriate use of the newer non-vitamin K antagonist oral 
      anticoagulants in this population, this study specifically reviews the available 
      literature for rivaroxaban and the impact of age that may affect the 
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety of this anticoagulant. 
      METHODS: This review includes a summary of data obtained from the available 
      literature concerning both older healthy subjects and older patients with various 
      aspects of cardiovascular disease enrolled in rivaroxaban clinical trials and 
      data from real world evidence studies. RESULTS: Evaluation of the clinical 
      pharmacology in healthy, older adults reveal no clinically relevant effect of age 
      on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Population pharmacokinetic 
      studies in older patients with thromboembolic diseases suggest a moderate effect 
      of increasing age on rivaroxaban clearance, albeit not clinically significant. 
      Additionally, sub-group analyses from large, phase 3 clinical trials demonstrate 
      consistent efficacy and safety in the older patient population vs the overall 
      population. These findings are further supported by real-world evidence studies. 
      CONCLUSION: A favorable clinical profile with rivaroxaban was observed across age 
      sub-groups, supporting the premise that dosing in older adults does not 
      necessitate adjustment. However, it is prudent that a cautious and individualized 
      approach is taken for treatment with any anticoagulant in older adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are highly 
      prevalent among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Until recently, 
      warfarin was the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant. Direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) have important advantages and have been shown to be 
      noninferior to warfarin with respect to stroke prevention or recurrent VTE in the 
      general population, with lower bleeding rates. This review article will provide 
      available evidence on the use of DOACs in patients with CKD. SUMMARY: In post hoc 
      analyses of major randomized studies with DOACs for stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation, in the subgroup of participants with moderate CKD, defined as a 
      creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30-50 mL/min, dabigatran 150 mg and apixaban were 
      associated with lower rates of stroke and systemic embolism, whereas apixaban and 
      edoxaban were associated with lower bleeding and mortality rates, compared with 
      warfarin. In retrospective observational studies in patients with advanced CKD 
      (defined as a CrCl &lt;30 mL/min) and atrial fibrillation, DOACs had similar 
      efficacy with warfarin with numerically lower bleeding rates. All agents warrant 
      dose adjustment in moderate-to-severe CKD. In patients on maintenance dialysis, 
      the VALKYRIE trial, which was designed initially to study the effect of vitamin K 
      on vascular calcification progression, established superiority for rivaroxaban 
      compared with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in the extension phase. Two other 
      clinical trials using apixaban (AXADIA and RENAL-AF) in this population were 
      inconclusive due to recruitment challenges and low event rates. In post hoc 
      analyses of randomized studies with DOACs in patients with VTE, in the subgroup 
      of participants with moderate CKD at baseline, edoxaban was associated with lower 
      rates of recurrent VTE, whereas rivaroxaban and dabigatran were associated with 
      lower and higher bleeding rates, respectively, as compared to warfarin. KEY 
      MESSAGES: DOACs have revolutionized the management of atrial fibrillation and 
      VTE, and they should be preferred over warfarin in patients with 
      moderate-to-severe CKD with appropriate dose adjustment. Therapeutic drug 
      monitoring with a valid technique may be considered to guide clinical management 
      in individualized cases. Current evidence questions the need for oral 
      anticoagulation in patients on maintenance dialysis with atrial fibrillation as 
      both DOACs and VKAs are associated with high rates of major bleeding.

LID - 10.1111/jvim.17216 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparative pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of apixaban 
      and rivaroxaban have not been studied in dogs and the propensity of these drugs 
      to cause hypercoagulability after discontinuation is unknown. HYPOTHESIS: Compare 
      the PK/PD of clinical dosing regimens of PO apixaban and rivaroxaban administered 
      repeatedly to healthy dogs and assess the effect of abrupt drug discontinuation 
      on coagulation. ANIMALS: Six University-owned, purpose-bred, middle-aged, 
      mixed-breed dogs (4 male, 2 female). METHODS: Dogs were given apixaban or 
      rivaroxaban PO at 0.5 mg/kg q12h for 7 days with a 14-day washout period between 
      drugs. Plasma drug concentrations were quantitated, and anticoagulant effects 
      were measured using clotting times, calibrated anti-Xa bioactivity assays, and 
      measurements of thrombin generation. The potential for rebound hypercoagulability 
      was assessed by measuring D-dimers, thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes, and 
      antithrombin activity after drug discontinuation. RESULTS: Plasma drug 
      concentrations and anti-Xa bioactivities were closely correlated for both drugs, 
      but drug concentrations varied considerably among dogs, despite consistent dose 
      regimens. Thrombin generation variables were significantly correlated with the 
      anti-Xa bioactivity of both drugs and no significant differences in the effects 
      of apixaban and rivaroxaban on thrombin generation were observed. Drug 
      discontinuation had no effect on D-dimer concentrations. The concentration of TAT 
      complexes decreased after apixaban discontinuation and did not change after 
      rivaroxaban discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Repeated PO 
      administration of apixaban or rivaroxaban to healthy dogs produced comparable 
      anticoagulant effects measured by inhibition of thrombin formation. Rebound 
      hypercoagulability after drug discontinuation was not observed and weaning of 
      these drugs in clinical patients might not be necessary.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor. Its interindividual variability is 
      large and may be connected to the occurrence of adverse drug reactions or drug 
      inefficacy. Pharmacogenetics studies concentrating on the reasons underlying 
      rivaroxaban's inadequate response could help explain the differences in treatment 
      results and medication safety profiles. Against this background, this study 
      evaluated whether polymorphisms in the gene encoding the ABCG2 transporter modify 
      the pharmacokinetic characteristics of rivaroxaban. A total of 117 healthy 
      volunteers participated in two bioequivalence experiments with a single oral dose 
      of 20 mg rivaroxaban, with one group fasting and the other being fed. 
      Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was 
      employed to determine the plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban, and the WinNonlin 
      program was used to calculate the pharmacokinetics parameters. In the fasting 
      group, the rivaroxaban pharmacokinetic parameters of Vd (508.27 vs 334.45 vs 
      275.59 L) and t1/2 (41.04 vs 16.43 vs 15.47 h) were significantly higher in ABCG2 
      421 A/A genotype carriers than in ABCG2 421 C/C and 421 C/A genotype carriers 
      (P<0.05). The mean values of Cmax (145.81 vs 176.27 vs 190.19 ng/mL), AUC0-t 
      (1193.81 vs 1374.69 vs 1570.77 ng/mL·h), and Cl (11.82 vs 14.50 vs 13.01 mL/h) 
      for these groups were lower, but this difference was not statistically 
      significant (P>0.05). These findings suggested that the ABCG2 421 A/A genotype 
      may impact rivaroxaban parameters after a single dose in healthy subjects. This 
      finding must be validated before it is applied in clinical practice.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetics and Hemorrhagic Risk Analysis of Rivaroxaban in 
      Elderly Chinese Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is a popular direct factor Xa inhibitor used for anticoagulation 
      therapy in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The aim of this 
      study was to establish a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model for rivaroxaban 
      in elderly Chinese patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, evaluate 
      precision dosing regimens, and analyze hemorrhagic risk after rivaroxaban 
      treatment. A 1-compartment population PK model with estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR), total bilirubin (TBIL), and ABCB1 rs1045642 as major 
      covariates for apparent clearance was developed using the nonlinear mixed-effects 
      model (NONMEM). A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to evaluate various dosing 
      schemes and different levels of covariates for the target range of therapeutic 
      drug-monitoring concentrations (C(max,ss) and C(min,ss) ). The exposure to 
      rivaroxaban was simulated and assessed through hemorrhagic risk evaluation. The 
      results showed that the average probability of target attainment (PTA) for 
      optimal dosing regimens with different covariate levels for the targeted 
      C(max,ss) and C(min,ss) were 29.35% to 31.3% and 64.91% to 65.8%, respectively. A 
      dosage of 10 mg of rivaroxaban in elderly Chinese patients with normal renal and 
      liver function was appropriate. The area under the concentration-time curve 
      estimated over 24 hours with precision dosing at steady state (AUC(24,ss) ) was 
      statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of bleeding events 
      (OR 1.0006, 95%CI 1.0003 to 1.001, P < .0001), and the bleeding risk increased by 
      1.82-fold for every 1000 μg*h/L increase in AUC(24,ss) . A lower dose is 
      recommended for elderly patients with renal impairment to avoid overexposure and 
      bleeding events. The PPK model could inform individualized dosing for elderly 
      Chinese patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation receiving rivaroxaban 
      anticoagulation therapy.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To present the randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence and 
      highlight the areas of uncertainty regarding direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) 
      for cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (CAT). RECENT FINDINGS: In the last 
      years, four RCTs have shown that rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban are at least 
      as effective as low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for the treatment of both 
      incidental and symptomatic CAT. On the other hand, these drugs increase the risk 
      of major gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cancer at this site. Another 
      two RCTs have demonstrated that apixaban and rivaroxaban also prevent CAT in 
      subjects at intermediate-to-high risk commencing chemotherapy, albeit at the 
      price of higher likelihood of bleeding. By contrast, data are limited about the 
      use DOAC in individuals with intracranial tumors or concomitant thrombocytopenia. 
      It is also possible that some anticancer agents heighten the effects of DOAC via 
      pharmacokinetic interactions, up to making their effectiveness-safety profile 
      unfavorable. Leveraging the results of the aforementioned RCTS, current 
      guidelines recommend DOAC as the anticoagulants of choice for CAT treatment and, 
      in selected cases, prevention. However, the benefit of DOAC is less defined in 
      specific patient subgroups, in which the choice of DOAC over LMWH should be 
      carefully pondered.

AB  - Special aspects of anticoagulation in children include the different epidemiology 
      of thrombosis, developmental changes in the coagulation system, age-dependent 
      pharmacokinetics of anticoagulants, risk of bleeding, and practical hurdles to 
      anticoagulation. The classical anticoagulants so far used in children have 
      several limitations, resulting in the need for regular monitoring. The 
      pharmacological properties of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and the special 
      challenges of anticoagulation in children make the DOACs particularly attractive 
      for children. All DOACs have pediatric development programs, targeting various 
      indications for prevention and treatment of thrombosis. Child-appropriate 
      formulations have been developed, age-specific dosing information generated, and 
      safety and efficacy evaluated in ongoing phase 3 trials. Rivaroxaban and 
      dabigatran have already been authorized for children for treatment of acute 
      venous thrombosis and for extended secondary prevention. Their safety and 
      efficacy have been demonstrated comparable to that of standard-of-care 
      anticoagulants, without need for monitoring. Further studies are ongoing, which 
      are expected to lead to pediatric authorizations of DOACs for primary venous 
      thromboembolic event prevention in some high-risk settings. More real-life data 
      will be necessary from postmarketing studies and registries to complement the 
      evidence base for DOAC use in children, particularly in the youngest age groups 
      and special disease populations.

AB  - Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) vary in bioavailability and sites of 
      absorption in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Data on DOAC use after major GIT 
      surgery are limited. The aim of this case series was to report the impact of 
      surgical resection or bypass of the GIT on rivaroxaban and apixaban peak plasma 
      concentrations. This was a case series of patients who received rivaroxaban or 
      apixaban after GIT surgery, during the period of July 1, 2019, to December 31, 
      2020. Peak plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban and apixaban were assessed for 
      the expected concentrations. Of the 27 assessed patients, 18 (66.7%) received 
      rivaroxaban, and 9 (33.3%) received apixaban. After rivaroxaban therapy, 4 of 5 
      patients (80%) who underwent gastrectomy, and 3 of 3 patients (100%) who 
      underwent duodenum and proximal jejunum exclusion had peak plasma concentrations 
      of rivaroxaban lower than the effective range, whereas 11 of 11 patients (100%) 
      who underwent distal bowel or ileostomy had peak rivaroxaban plasma within the 
      effective range. After apixaban therapy, 5 of 6 patients (83.3%) who underwent 
      total or partial gastrectomy achieved effective peak concentrations. All the 
      patients who underwent proximal and distal bowel resection or bypass had peak 
      concentrations of apixaban within the effective range. In conclusion, surgical 
      resection or bypass of the upper GIT could affect DOAC absorption and 
      subsequently peak plasma concentrations. This effect was more observed among 
      rivaroxaban recipients. An injectable anticoagulant or vitamin K antagonist may 
      be preferred if DOAC concentrations cannot be measured after GIT surgery.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rivaroxaban is one of the most commonly used non-vitamin K 
      antagonists for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF). Different individual exposures exist for Asian and non-Asian 
      populations, and dose selection is different for Japanese and non-Japanese 
      subjects. Few studies have investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of rivaroxaban in Chinese patients and provided a solid 
      reference for dose selection and individualised therapy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 
      This is a single-centre prospective study. Rivaroxaban-treated Chinese NVAF 
      patients will be recruited according to predetermined inclusion criteria. Blood 
      samples will be collected from both outpatients and inpatients with different 
      sampling strategies at steady state. Rivaroxaban plasma concentration, factor Xa 
      activity, prothrombin time and single-nucleotide polymorphisms of candidate genes 
      will be evaluated. Follow-up will be conducted following 3 and 6 months after 
      enrolment to collect information about the safety and efficacy outcomes. A 
      nonlinear mixed-effects modelling strategy will be used to develop a population 
      PK-PD model of rivaroxaban. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved 
      by the Ethics Committee of Huashan Hospital, Fudan University (KY2020-016). The 
      study findings will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals and shared with public 
      health authorities. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2100046685.

TI  - Rivaroxaban for treatment of pediatric venous thromboembolism. An Einstein-Jr 
      phase 3 dose-exposure-response evaluation.
PG  - 1672-1685
LID - 10.1111/jth.14813 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, the randomized EINSTEIN-Jr study showed similar efficacy 
      and safety for rivaroxaban and standard anticoagulation for treatment of 
      pediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE). The rivaroxaban dosing strategy was 
      established based on phase 1 and 2 data in children and through pharmacokinetic 
      (PK) modeling. METHODS: Rivaroxaban treatment with tablets or the newly developed 
      granules-for-oral suspension formulation was bodyweight-adjusted and administered 
      once-daily, twice-daily, or thrice-daily for children with bodyweights of ≥30, 
      ≥12 to <30, and <12 kg, respectively. Previously, these regimens were confirmed 
      for children weighing ≥20 kg but only predicted in those <20 kg. Based on sparse 
      blood sampling, the daily area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      [AUC((0-24)ss) ] and trough [C(trough,ss) ] and maximum [C(max,ss) ] steady-state 
      plasma concentrations were derived using population PK modeling. 
      Exposure-response graphs were generated to evaluate the potential relationship of 
      individual PK parameters with recurrent VTE, repeat imaging outcomes, and 
      bleeding or adverse events. A taste-and-texture questionnaire was collected for 
      suspension-recipients. RESULTS: Of the 335 children (aged 0-17 years) allocated 
      to rivaroxaban, 316 (94.3%) were evaluable for PK analyses. Rivaroxaban exposures 
      were within the adult exposure range. No clustering was observed for any of the 
      PK parameters with efficacy, bleeding, or adverse event outcomes. Results were 
      similar for the tablet and suspension formulation. Acceptability and palatability 
      of the suspension were favorable. DISCUSSION: Based on this analysis and the 
      recently documented similar efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban compared with 
      standard anticoagulation, we conclude that bodyweight-adjusted pediatric 
      rivaroxaban regimens with either tablets or suspension are validated and provide 
      for appropriate treatment of children with VTE.

AB  - Background Patients with single-ventricle physiology who undergo the Fontan 
      procedure are at risk for thrombotic events associated with significant morbidity 
      and mortality. The UNIVERSE Study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a novel 
      liquid rivaroxaban formulation, using a body weight-adjusted dosing regimen, 
      versus acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in children post-Fontan. Methods and Results 
      The UNIVERSE Study was a randomized, multicenter, 2-part, open-label study of 
      rivaroxaban, in children who had undergone a Fontan procedure, to evaluate its 
      dosing regimen, safety, and efficacy. Part A was the single-arm part of the study 
      that determined the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and safety of rivaroxaban 
      in 12 participants before proceeding to part B, whereby 100 participants were 
      randomized 2:1 to open-label rivaroxaban versus ASA. The study period was 
      12 months. A total of 112 participants were enrolled across 35 sites in 10 
      countries. In part B, for safety outcomes, major bleeding occurred in one 
      participant on rivaroxaban (epistaxis that required transfusion). Clinically 
      relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 6% of participants on rivaroxaban versus 
      9% on ASA. Trivial bleeding occurred in 33% of participants on rivaroxaban versus 
      35% on ASA. For efficacy outcomes, 1 participant on rivaroxaban in part B had a 
      pulmonary embolism (2% overall event rate); and for ASA, 1 participant had 
      ischemic stroke and 2 had venous thrombosis (9% overall event rate). Conclusions 
      In this study, participants who received rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis had a 
      similar safety profile and fewer thrombotic events, albeit not statistically 
      significant, compared with those in the ASA group. Registration URL:

TI  - Rivaroxaban Pharmacokinetics in Obese Subjects: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 1677-1695
LID - 10.1007/s40262-022-01160-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of morbidity and 
      mortality globally. The direct oral anticoagulants, including rivaroxaban, are 
      relatively novel therapeutic options in the treatment and prevention of VTE. 
      There is a conflicting and inconclusive evidence surrounding the pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) of rivaroxaban in patients with VTE who are obese. OBJECTIVES: We conducted 
      a systematic review to provide an overview, and to synthesize the available 
      evidence in the current literature pertaining to rivaroxaban PK in obese subjects 
      who are healthy or diseased. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, Rayyan, 
      and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched from 1 May 2021 
      through 28 February 2022. Studies investigating rivaroxaban PK in adult obese 
      subjects were included in the review. Pertinent data, including anthropometric 
      parameters, rivaroxaban dosage regimen, PK parameters, PK model, and outcome 
      measures were extracted. Reference values of rivaroxaban PK parameters in the 
      general population were used for comparison purposes. The review protocol was 
      registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020177770). RESULTS: In the 11 studies 
      included in this systematic review, over 7140 healthy or diseased subjects 
      received rivaroxaban therapy, with varying clinical indications in the diseased 
      population. The reported PK parameters of rivaroxaban in obese subjects compared 
      with reference values in the general population were variable. The reported 
      values of the volume of distribution (V(d)) among obese subjects (73.4-82.8 L) 
      fell within the range of values reported/calculated for the general population 
      (59.4-104 L), assuming complete bioavailability. However, some of the reported 
      values of clearance (CL) in obese subjects (7.86-16.8 L.h(-1)) do not fall within 
      the range of values reported/calculated for the general population 
      (5.57-11.3 L.h(-1)). The reported maximum plasma concentrations in obese subjects 
      versus the general population following a 10 mg dose were 149 vs. 143-180 
      µg.L(-1), and following a 20 mg dose were 214-305 vs. 299-360 µg.L(-1), 
      respectively. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curves (AUC) 
      over different intervals in obese subjects versus the general population 
      following a 10 mg dose were 1155 (AUC from time zero to infinity [AUC(∞)]) vs. 
      1029 (AUC(∞)) µg.h.L(-1); and 1204-2800 (AUC from time zero to 24 h [AUC(24)]) 
      vs. 3200 (AUC(24)) µg.h.L(-1), respectively, following a 20 mg dose. The reported 
      values of half-life and time to reach the maximum plasma concentration in obese 
      subjects versus the general population were not consistent across studies. 
      CONCLUSION: Variable changes and inconsistencies in different rivaroxaban PK 
      parameters were reported in obese subjects. Further well-designed studies are 
      warranted to better characterize the PK and clinical outcomes of rivaroxaban in 
      subjects with obesity.

TI  - Effect of major gastrointestinal tract surgery on the absorption and efficacy of 
      direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs).
PG  - 343-351
LID - 10.1007/s11239-016-1465-x [doi]
AB  - Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been introduced as alternatives to 
      warfarin for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for 
      treatment of venous thromboembolism. Many patients undergoing major 
      gastrointestinal resections or bypass receive anticoagulants for various 
      indications, including the treatment of thrombotic complication of surgery and 
      prevention of visceral vessels events recurrence. DOACs have a wide therapeutic 
      range that allows fixed dosing determined based on studies conducted in healthy 
      subjects with normal absorptive capacity. Patients with significantly altered 
      gastrointestinal tracts were not included in the Phase II and III studies that 
      assessed DOAC efficacy and safety. The aim of this article is to review clinical 
      data on DOACs use in patients with major surgical resection or bypass. MEDLINE 
      and EMBASE were searched to identify studies and case reports of DOAC use in this 
      population. Prescribing information for the four approved DOACs was also 
      reviewed. The only types of available literature identified were case series and 
      isolated case reports. Patients who underwent major distal intestinal resection 
      were successfully anticoagulated with rivaroxaban, dabigatran was not effective. 
      There is uncertainty about the efficacy of rivaroxaban and dabigatran in patients 
      requiring anticoagulation after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Avoidance of 
      rivaroxaban therapy in patients undergoing gastrectomy is advised Data are

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A number of direct oral anticoagulants are now available and offer 
      alternative strategies for anticoagulation therapy. Rivaroxaban, a direct oral 
      Factor Xa inhibitor, is approved for use across several thromboembolic 
      indications. This article aims to provide an overview of the key pharmacological 
      characteristics of rivaroxaban and the rationale and evidence for the use of 
      different dose regimens across its licenced indications, and offer practical 
      guidance to healthcare professionals on responsible use. References were sourced 
      via PubMed searches using the search string (rivaroxaban AND (pharmacokinetics OR 
      pharmacodynamics OR (clinical studies) OR (drug interaction)) NOT review NOT 
      (children OR pediatrics OR paediatrics OR adolescent)). KEY FINDINGS: Rivaroxaban 
      exhibits predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and thus does not 
      require routine coagulation monitoring, unlike vitamin K antagonists (e.g. 
      warfarin). Rivaroxaban also has a lower potential for drug-drug and food-drug 
      interactions compared with warfarin; however, co-administration with strong 
      inhibitors of both cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein is not recommended. The 
      data indicate that dose adjustment is not necessary for age, gender or body 
      weight. The dosing regimens of rivaroxaban vary depending on the indication, and 
      phase III studies have demonstrated a favourable benefit-risk profile of 
      rivaroxaban compared with traditional standard of care. SUMMARY: Rivaroxaban may 
      offer an anticoagulant option that could simplify and improve the management of 
      patients with thromboembolic disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) 
      and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of rivaroxaban 15 mg administered before and 
      after dialysis in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and to compare 
      this profile in subjects with ESRD to that in healthy control subjects 
      (creatinine clearance ≥80 ml/min). METHODS: This was an open-label, single-dose, 
      single-center, parallel-group study of rivaroxaban in ESRD subjects who had been 
      clinically stable on maintenance hemodialysis for ≥3 months. In 8 subjects with 
      ESRD, a 15-mg dose of rivaroxaban was administered 2 ± 0.5 h before a 
      hemodialysis session and repeated 7-14 days later at 3 h after a 4-h hemodialysis 
      session. Eight healthy control subjects, matched for age, sex, and body mass 
      index, received one 15-mg rivaroxaban dose. RESULTS: Compared to healthy 
      subjects, area under the rivaroxaban plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) 
      increased by 56% following post-dialysis administration. Assuming similar 
      bioavailability between groups, this reflects an approximate 35% decrease in 
      overall drug clearance in ESRD subjects. Pre-dialysis dosing resulted in only 5% 
      lowering of AUC versus post-dialysis dosing, confirming the minimal impact of 
      dialysis on the PK of rivaroxaban. PD effects, as assessed by change in 
      prothrombin time, percent factor Xa inhibition, and anti-Xa activity, were 
      generally concordant with observed changes in plasma PK. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in 
      PK and PD parameters in chronic dialysis patients were generally comparable to 
      changes observed previously in patients with moderate-to-severe renal impairment 
      who were not undergoing dialysis, and support use of a 15-mg dose in this patient 
      population.

PG  - 1466-1474
LID - 10.1111/bcp.14553 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the influence of a cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and efflux 
      transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inducing Hypericum perforatum extract on the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban. METHODS: Open-label, 
      nonrandomized, sequential treatment interaction study. Following CYP3A4 and P-gp 
      phenotyping using low-dose midazolam and fexofenadine, 12 healthy volunteers 
      received a single oral dose of 20 mg rivaroxaban and rivaroxaban plasma 
      concentrations and inhibition of the activated coagulation factor X (factor Xa) 
      activity were measured prior to and up to 48 h postdosing. The procedures were 
      repeated after 2 weeks' treatment with the H. perforatum extract. RESULTS: The 
      geometric mean ratios for the area under the concentration-time curve and C(max) 
      of rivaroxaban after/before induction with the H. perforatum extract were 0.76 
      (90% confidence interval [CI] 0.70, 0.82) and 0.86 (90% CI 0.76, 0.97), 
      respectively. Inhibition of factor Xa activity was reduced with a geometric mean 
      area under the effect-time curve ratio after/before induction of 0.80 (90% CI 
      0.71, 0.89). No clinically significant differences were found regarding T(max) 
      (median 1.5 vs 1 h, P = .26) and terminal elimination half-life (mean 10.6 vs 
      10.8 h, P = .93) of rivaroxaban. The H. perforatum extract significantly induced 
      CYP3A4 and P-gp activity, as evidenced by phenotyping. CONCLUSION: The 
      CYP3A4/P-gp inducing H. perforatum extract caused a decrease of rivaroxaban 
      exposure with a proportional decrease of the pharmacodynamic effect. Although the 
      data do not justify a contraindication for the combination or a systematic 
      adjustment of rivaroxaban dosage, avoidance of the combination or laboratory 
      monitoring should be considered in patients taking hyperforin-containing H. 
      perforatum extracts with rivaroxaban.

TI  - The Influence of ABCB1 (rs1045642 and rs4148738) Gene Polymorphisms on 
      Rivaroxaban Pharmacokinetics in Patients Aged 80 Years and Older with Nonvalvular 
      Atrial Fibrillation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: ABCB1 gene polymorphisms are associated with rivaroxaban 
      distribution changes and adverse reactions but the data are controversial. AIM: 
      To evaluate the influence of ABCB1 (rs1045642 and rs4148738) gene polymorphisms 
      on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics in patients aged 80 years and older with 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NAF). METHODS: 128 patients aged 80 years and 
      older (median [Me] age 87.5 [83.0-90.0] years) with NAF were included. We 
      performed ABCB1 (rs1045642 and rs4148738) genotyping, measured the trough 
      steady-state plasma concentration (C(min,ss)) of rivaroxaban and prothrombin time 
      (PT) and analyzed prior medical records for clinically relevant non-major 
      bleeding (CRNMB). RESULTS: CC genotype carriers had no differences in C(min,ss) 
      (p > 0.05) compared with the CT and TT rs1045642 and rs4148738 genotypes 
      carriers. CC genotype carriers had no differences in PT (p > 0.05) compared with 
      the CT rs1045642 and rs4148738 and TT rs4148738 genotypes carriers. In the TT 
      genotype PT levels were higher than in the CC rs1045642 genotype: Me 14.2 
      [13.0-16.1] sec vs 13.3 [12.4-14.5] sec (p = 0.049). Incidence of CRNMB was 
      higher in patients with the TT genotype compared with the CC rs1045642 (29.3% vs 
      4.5%, p = 0.021) and rs4148738 (39.3% vs 8.1%, p = 0.008) and the CT genotype 
      rs4148738 (39.3% vs 14.3%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: ABCB1 (rs1045642 and 
      rs4148738) polymorphisms didn't influence rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics in 
      patients aged 80 years and older with NAF. TT carriers developed CRNMB more 
      frequently compared with the CC rs1045642 and the CC and CT rs4148738 genotypes. 
      The haplotype TT-TT haplotype was associated with a higher frequency of CRNMB.

TI  - Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics during the transition from warfarin to 
      rivaroxaban: a randomized study in healthy subjects.
PG  - 353-63
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12349 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study investigated relevant pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic 
      parameters during the transition from warfarin to rivaroxaban in healthy male 
      subjects. METHODS: Ninety-six healthy men were randomized into the following 
      three groups: warfarin [international normalized ratio (INR) 2.0-3.0] 
      transitioned to rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (od; group A); warfarin (INR 
      2.0-3.0) followed by placebo od (group B); and rivaroxaban alone 20 mg od (group 
      C) for 4 days. Anti-factor Xa activity, inhibition of factor Xa activity, 
      prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time, HepTest, 
      prothrombinase-induced clotting time, factor VIIa activity, factor IIa activity, 
      endogenous thrombin potential and pharmacokinetics were measured. RESULTS: An 
      additive effect was observed on the PT and PT/INR during the initial transition 
      period. The mean maximal prolongation of PT was 4.39-fold [coefficient of 
      variation (CV) 18.03%; range 3.39-6.50] of the baseline value in group A, 
      compared with 1.88-fold (CV 10.35%; range 1.53-2.21) in group B and 1.57-fold (CV 
      9.98%; range 1.37-2.09) in group C. Rivaroxaban had minimal influence on the 
      PT/INR at trough levels. Inhibition of factor Xa activity, activated partial 
      thromboplastin time and endogenous thrombin potential were also enhanced, but to 
      a lesser extent. In contrast, the effects of rivaroxaban on anti-factor Xa 
      activity, HepTest and prothrombinase-induced clotting time were not affected by 
      pretreatment with warfarin. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in pharmacodynamics during the 
      transition from warfarin to rivaroxaban vary depending on the test used. A 
      supra-additive effect on PT/INR is expected during the initial period of 
      transition, but pretreatment with warfarin does not influence the effect of 
      rivaroxaban on anti-factor Xa activity.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single doses of rivaroxaban in obese 
      patients prior to and after bariatric surgery.
PG  - 1466-1475
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13243 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Venous thromboembolism is an important cause of postoperative morbidity and 
      mortality in bariatric surgery. Studies of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are 
      not available in this surgical field. The objective of this phase 1 clinical 
      trial was to investigate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters 
      of rivaroxaban in bariatric patients. METHODS: In this single-centre study, obese 
      patients received single oral doses of rivaroxaban (10 mg) 1 day prior to and 
      3 days after bariatric surgery. PK and PD parameters were assessed at baseline 
      and during 24 h after drug ingestion. RESULTS: Six Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
      patients and six sleeve gastrectomy patients completed the study. Mean 
      rivaroxaban area under plasma concentration-time curve, peak plasma 
      concentration, time to peak plasma concentration and terminal half-life were 
      971.9 μg·h l(-1) (coefficient of variation: 10.6), 135.3 μg l(-1) (26.7), 1.5 h 
      and 13.1 h (34.1) prior to and 1165.8 (21.9), 170.0 (15.9), 1.5 and 8.9 (44.6) 
      postsurgery for SG patients and 933.7 μg·h l(-1) (22.3), 136.5 μg l(-1) (10.7), 
      1.5 h und 13.8 h (46.6) prior to and 1029.4 (7.4), 110.8 (31.8), 2.5 and 15 
      (60.0) postsurgery for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients, respectively. 
      Prothrombin fragments (F1 + 2) decreased during the first 12 hours and increased 
      thereafter in the pre- and the postbariatric setting. Thrombin-antithrombin 
      complexes dropped within 1-3 h in the prebariatric setting and remained low after 
      surgery until they increased at 24 h postdose. Rivaroxaban was well tolerated and 
      no relevant safety issues were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery does not 
      appear to alter PK of rivaroxaban in a clinically relevant way. Effective 
      prophylactic postbariatric anticoagulation is supported by changes in PD.

PG  - 86-97
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04181.x [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: • Population pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban have been characterized in healthy subjects and 
      in patients with total venous thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis or atrial 
      fibrillation. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: • This article is the first description of 
      the population pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of rivaroxaban in 
      patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It is the largest population 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study on rivaroxaban conducted to date (n= 
      2290). The PK and PK-PD relationship of rivaroxaban in patients with ACS were 
      similar to those in other patient populations. In addition, model-based 
      simulations showed that the influence of renal function and age on the exposure 
      to rivaroxaban in the ACS population were similar to the findings from Phase 1 
      special population studies. These findings suggest that rivaroxaban has highly 
      predictable PK-PD and may provide a consistent anticoagulant effect across the 
      studied patient populations, which allows an accurate prediction of the dose to 
      control anticoagulation optimally. AIMS: The aim of this analysis was to use a 
      population approach to facilitate the understanding of the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) 
      and to evaluate the influence of patient covariates on the exposure of 
      rivaroxaban in patients with ACS. METHODS A population pharmacokinetic model was 
      developed using pharmacokinetic samples from 2290 patients in Anti-Xa Therapy to 
      Lower Cardiovascular Events in Addition to Standard Therapy in Subjects with 
      Acute Coronary Syndrome Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 46. The 
      relationship between pharmacokinetics and the primary pharmacodynamic end point, 
      prothrombin time, was evaluated. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in 
      patients with ACS was adequately described by an oral one-compartment model. The 
      estimated absorption rate, apparent clearance and volume of distribution were 
      1.24 h(-1) (interindividual variability, 139%), 6.48 l h(-1) (31%) and 57.9 l 
      (10%), respectively. Simulations indicate that the influences of renal function, 
      age and bodyweight on exposure in ACS patients are consistent with the findings 
      in previous Phase 1 studies. Rivaroxaban plasma concentrations exhibit a 
      close-to-linear relationship with prothrombin time in the ACS population, with 
      little interindividual variability. The estimated pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic parameters for the ACS patients were comparable to those for 
      venous thromboembolism prevention, deep vein thrombosis and atrial fibrillation 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: The similarity in pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of 
      rivaroxaban among different patient populations and the low interindividual 
      variability in the exposure-prothrombin time relationship indicate that the 
      anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is highly predictable and consistent across 
      all the patient populations studied.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is a direct inhibitor of factor Xa, a member of direct oral 
      anticoagulant group of drugs (DOACs). Despite being a widely extended alternative 
      to vitamin K antagonists (i.e., acenocoumarol, warfarin) the interindividual 
      variability of DOACs is significant, and may be related to adverse drug reaction 
      occurrence or drug inefficacy, namely hemorrhagic or thromboembolic events. Since 
      there is not a consistent analytic practice to monitor the anticoagulant activity 
      of DOACs, previously reported polymorphisms in genes coding for proteins 
      responsible for the activation, transport, or metabolism of DOACs were studied. 
      The study population comprised 60 healthy volunteers, who completed two 
      randomized, crossover bioequivalence clinical trials between two different 
      rivaroxaban formulations. The effect of food, sex, biogeographical origin and 55 
      variants (8 phenotypes and 47 single nucleotide polymorphisms) in drug 
      metabolizing enzyme genes (such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, NAT2) and transporters 
      (namely, ABCB1, ABCG2) on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics was tested. Individuals 
      dosed under fasting conditions presented lower t(max) (2.21 h vs 2.88 h, 
      β = 1.19, R(2) =0.342, p = 0.012) compared to fed volunteers. NAT2 slow 
      acetylators presented higher AUC(∞) corrected by dose/weight (AUC(∞)/DW; 8243.90 
      vs 7698.20 and 7161.25 h*ng*mg /ml*kg, β = 0.154, R(2) =0.250, p = 0.044), higher 
      C(max)/DW (1070.99 vs 834.81 and 803.36 ng*mg /ml*kg, β = 0.245, R(2) =0.320, 
      p = 0.002), and lower t(max) (2.63 vs 3.19 and 4.15 h, β = -0.346, R(2) =0.282, 
      p = 0.047) than NAT2 rapid and intermediate acetylators. No other association was 
      statistically significant. Thus, slow NAT2 appear to have altered rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics, increasing AUC(∞) and C(max). Nonetheless, further research

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetics of Rivaroxaban in Real-World Patients.
PG  - 943-949

AB  - The pharmacokinetics (PK) of rivaroxaban have been studied in different 
      populations, and there were differences in the PK parameters. However, most of 
      these studies were conducted on healthy subjects from different ethnic groups. 
      Thus, this study aimed to investigate the PK of rivaroxaban in real-world 
      patients to determine the covariates that may cause differences in the 
      pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. This was a prospective observational study. Five 
      blood samples were collected at different time points after starting the 
      rivaroxaban dose. Plasma concentrations were analyzed, and population PK models 
      were developed using Monolix version 4.4 software. In total, 100 blood samples 
      from 20 patients (50% men/50% women) were analyzed. The patients' mean (±standard 
      deviation) age was 53.1 (±15.5) years and their mean body weight was 81.7 
      (±27.2) kg. The PK of rivaroxaban were described by a 1-compartment model. The 
      initial estimates for the absorption rate constant, apparent clearance (CL/F), 
      and apparent volume of distribution were 1.8/h, 4.46 L/h, and 21.7 L, 
      respectively. The interindividual variability for absorption rate constant, CL/F, 
      and volume of distribution was 14%, 24%, and 29.3%, respectively. Covariates were 
      tested for their influence on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics. The aspartate 
      aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, body mass index, and albumin 
      concentrations had an effect on the CL/F of rivaroxaban. In this analysis, the 
      population PK model of rivaroxaban found significant interindividual variability. 
      Several covariates influenced the clearance of rivaroxaban and contributed to 
      this variability. The results may provide a guide that can aid the clinician 
      during the initiation and adjustment of therapeutic regimens.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a medical condition characterized by 
      forming a blood clot, or thrombus, in one of the deep veins, typically in the 
      legs. It is a type of venous thromboembolism, which refers to the formation of 
      blood clots in the veins. It is caused by Virchow's triad (stasis, 
      hypercoagulation, and endothelial injury). OBJECTIVE: Our main objective is to 
      explore the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban and edoxaban in treating 
      lower extremity DVT. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study involving 406 
      patients subjected to DVT treatment using direct oral anticoagulants (edoxaban 
      and rivaroxaban) at our hospital. We recruited adult patients (aged 18 years and 
      more) diagnosed with lower extremity DVT and received treatment with either 
      rivaroxaban or edoxaban as the primary anticoagulant therapy for DVT. We excluded 
      patients who received treatment with other anticoagulant medications (warfarin 
      and heparin) as the primary therapy for DVT. RESULTS: The groups showed 
      statistically significant differences in red blood cell count and hemoglobin 
      levels, with the edoxaban group having high values. However, the 2 groups 
      observed no statistically significant differences in creatinine clearance, white 
      blood cell count, platelet count, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer levels. The 
      difference in the incidence of pulmonary embolism between the 2 groups was 
      statistically significant (P value < 0.001). The edoxaban group had fewer 
      pulmonary embolism patients than the rivaroxaban group. The reduction in 
      recurrent thrombosis was significantly higher in the rivaroxaban group compared 
      to the edoxaban group. There were no significant differences in the major 
      bleeding at various sites across the 2 treatment groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Rivaroxaban's pharmacokinetic profile includes rapid absorption and a relatively 
      short half-life. It means that once administered, rivaroxaban quickly reaches its 
      peak concentration in the blood and is subsequently eliminated from the body 
      within a relatively short period. Edoxaban's pharmacokinetic profile may include 
      slower absorption and a longer half-life than rivaroxaban. It can result in a 
      slower rate of achieving peak concentration and a more prolonged presence in the 
      bloodstream. These results emphasize the need for careful consideration of 
      anticoagulant therapy in patients with underlying cancer and underscore the 
      importance of managing risks while providing adequate anticoagulation to prevent 
      thrombotic events.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients on parenteral nutrition for short bowel syndrome 
      (SBS) have a high risk of thrombotic complications and are often treated with 
      parenteral anticoagulation. Direct oral anticoagulants are absorbed proximally in 
      the digestive tract and may represent alternative regimens in selected SBS 
      patients. In our pilot study, we provided pharmacokinetics parameters of 
      dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban in this setting and compared peak (Cmax), 
      trough (Ctrough) concentrations, and areas-under-the-concentration-time-curve 
      (AUC(0-t)) to reference values retrieved from phase I-III studies. METHODS: We 
      enrolled 6 adults with a remaining small bowel length≤200cm, normal renal/hepatic 
      function, and intact stomach. In our crossover study, patients were exposed to 
      twice-daily dabigatran etexilate 150mg and once-daily rivaroxaban 20mg. RESULTS: 
      After 5days of dabigatran dosing, Ctrough and Cmax geometric means were 39μg/L 
      (90% CI: 23-66) and 88μg/L (90% CI: 56-137), respectively; AUC(0-12h) was 
      958μg∗h/L (90% CI: 635-1445). After 5days of rivaroxaban dosing, Ctrough and Cmax 
      geometric means were 9μg/L (90% CI: 1-71) and 167μg/L (90% CI: 102-276), 
      respectively; AUC(0-24h) was 1720μg∗h/L (90% CI: 899-3300). Absorption was 
      negligible in one patient with ultra-short (~15cm) bowel. For dabigatran, Cmax 
      ratio was 0.57 (SD 0.33) and Ctrough ratio was 0.35 (SD 0.44). For rivaroxaban, 
      the mean observed-to-reference ratios AUC(0-24h) and Cmax ratios were 0.73 (SD 
      0.32) and 0.76 (SD 0.34), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: While in SBS patients there 
      is some absorption of the oral anticoagulants dabigatran etexilate and 
      rivaroxaban, it appears to be lower than reference values. Plasma drug levels 
      showed significant inter-individual variability.

      guidelines recommend against use in patients with a BMI > 40 kg/m(2) or 
      bodyweight > 120 kg unless drug-specific levels are measured, which may not be 
      feasible across all clinical practices. Accordingly, the objective of this study 
      was to broadly examine literature evaluating the clinical outcomes of rivaroxaban 
      and/or apixaban in patients with increased body mass. METHODS: A systematic 
      literature review (guided by PRISMA) was performed through January 27, 2021 using 
      PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. Key search term clusters included drug and 
      weight-related concepts (overweight/obese, body mass index [BMI], waist 
      circumference). DistillerSR was utilized to review and process search results. 
      Studies met inclusion if they analyzed the risk of bleeding and/or thrombosis in 
      patients with increased body mass (i.e., via BMI or other criteria) receiving 
      rivaroxaban or apixaban. Clinical guidelines, case reports/series, 
      pharmacokinetic/dynamic analyses, and commentaries were excluded. Bias was 
      examined qualitatively across studies. RESULTS: After duplicates were removed, 
      the original search rendered 1822 abstracts and 200 full-texts for screening, 
      ultimately providing a final set of 24 studies for qualitative review. Of these 
      studies, 13 (54.2%) enabled comparisons between patients of increased versus 
      normal body mass, while 11 (45.8%) reported outcomes only for patients of 
      increased body mass. The working definition of 'increased body mass' varied 
      amongst the studies, including 11 (45.8%) studies that utilized BMI, seven 
      (29.2%) with a combination of BMI and body measurement, two (8.3%) that relied on 
      body weight alone, and four (16.7%) that identified obesity-related ICD codes. 
      All 13 comparative studies found similar or reduced rates of safety and efficacy 
      outcomes with rivaroxaban and apixaban. CONCLUSION: The literature reports 
      similar or lower bleeding and thrombotic risk for rivaroxaban and apixaban in 
      patients of increased body mass compared to patients of normal body mass. Future 
      prospective controlled studies are needed to further define guidelines for use in 
      this population.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of anticoagulants apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban

AB  - Steady-state plasma concentrations of anticoagulants and the time since the 
      previous administration in mainly outpatients with atrial fibrillation 
      administered standard or reduced doses were analyzed for 110 elderly Japanese 
      subjects (mean age, 76 years) treated with apixaban (2.5 or 5.0 mg twice daily), 
      dabigatran etexilate (110 or 150 mg twice daily), edoxaban (30 or 60 mg once 
      daily) or rivaroxaban (10 or 15 mg once daily) at one general hospital. The 
      pharmacokinetics in patients treated with standard and reduced doses of the four 
      anticoagulants using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was compared 
      with the concentration ranges estimated using physiologically based 
      pharmacokinetic modeling. Reduced doses of anticoagulants resulted in relatively 
      small pharmacokinetic variations compared with the standard dose. Statistical 
      analyses revealed that renal impairment is likely not the sole determinant factor 
      for high plasma concentrations of apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban. 
      Patients with atrial fibrillation should be treated with the correct doses of 
      oral anticoagulants as specified in the package inserts (e.g. reduced doses for 
      elderly patients, patients with low body weights and in combination with 
      P-glycoprotein inhibitor drugs) to avoid excessive or insufficient doses of 
      direct oral anticoagulants.

TI  - The Pharmacogenetic Variability Associated with the Pharmacokinetics and 
      Pharmacodynamics of Rivaroxaban in Healthy Chinese Subjects: A National 
      Multicenter Exploratory Study.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the pharmacogenetic variability associated 
      with the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of rivaroxaban in 
      healthy Chinese subjects. METHODS: This was a multicenter study that included 304 
      healthy adults aged 18 to 45 years with unknown genotypes. All participants were 
      administered a single dose of rivaroxaban at 10 mg, 15 mg, or 20 mg. PK and PD 
      parameters were measured, and exome-wide association analysis was conducted. 
      FINDINGS: Sixteen SNPs located on 11 genes influenced the AUC(0-t). Among these, 
      the 3 most influential genes were MiR516A2, PARP14, and MIR618. Thirty-six SNPs 
      from 28 genes were associated with the PD of rivaroxaban. The 3 most influential 
      genes were PKNOX2, BRD3, and APOL4 for anti-Xa activity, and GRIP2, PLCE1, and 
      MLX for diluted prothrombin time (dPT). Among them, BRD3 played an important role 
      in both the PK and PD of rivaroxaban. Anti-Xa activity (ng/mL) differed 
      significantly among subjects with BRD3 rs467387: 145.1 ± 55.5 versus 139.9 ± 65.1 
      versus 164.0 ± 68.6 for GG, GA, and AA carriers, respectively (P = 0.0002). 
      IMPLICATIONS: This study found that that the regulation of the BRD3 gene might 
      affect the PK and PD of rivaroxaban, suggesting that it should be studied as a 
      new pharmacologic target. The correlation between this gene locus and clinical 
      outcomes has yet to be verified in patients undergoing clinical treatment.

TI  - Dissociation between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of once-daily 
      rivaroxaban and twice-daily apixaban: a randomized crossover study.
PG  - 2017-2028
LID - 10.1111/jth.13801 [doi]
AB  - Essentials In this crossover study the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban were compared. Healthy volunteers received rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily 
      or apixaban 5 mg twice daily. Rivaroxaban was associated with more prolonged 
      inhibition of thrombin generation than apixaban. Rivaroxaban induced a clear 
      prolongation of prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. 
      SUMMARY: Background The anticoagulant actions of the oral direct activated 
      factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, have not previously been directly 
      compared. Objectives To compare directly the steady-state pharmacokinetics and 
      anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban at doses approved for stroke 
      prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Methods Twenty-four 
      healthy Caucasian male volunteers were included in this open-label, two-period 
      crossover, phase 1 study (EudraCT number: 2015-002612-32). Volunteers were 
      randomized to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily or apixaban 5 mg twice daily 
      for 7 days, followed by a washout period of at least 7 days before they received 
      the other treatment. Plasma concentrations and anticoagulant effects were 
      measured at steady state and after drug discontinuation. Results Overall exposure 
      was similar for both drugs: the geometric mean area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve for the 0-24-h interval was 1830 μg h L(-1) for 
      rivaroxaban and 1860 μg h L(-1) for apixaban. Rivaroxaban was associated with 
      greater inhibition of endogenous thrombin potential (geometric mean area under 
      the curve relative to baseline during the 0-24-h interval: 15.5 h versus 17.5 h) 
      and a more pronounced maximal prolongation relative to baseline of prothrombin 
      time (PT) (1.66-fold versus 1.14-fold) and activated partial thromboplastin time 
      (APTT) (1.43-fold versus 1.16-fold) at steady state than apixaban. Conclusions 
      Despite similar exposure to both drugs, rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily was 
      associated with greater and more sustained inhibition of thrombin generation than 
      apixaban 5 mg twice daily. Sensitive PT and APTT assays can be used to estimate 
      the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban.

TI  - Application of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model approach to predict 
      pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interaction of rivaroxaban: A case study of 
      rivaroxaban and carbamazepine.
PG  - 1430-1442
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12844 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban (RIV; Xarelto; Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Beerse, Belgium) is one of 
      the direct oral anticoagulants. The drug is a strong substrate of cytochrome P450 
      (CYP) enzymes and efflux transporters. This study aimed to develop a 
      physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for RIV. It contained three 
      hepatic metabolizing enzyme reactions (CYP3A4, CYP2J2, and CYP-independent) and 
      two active transporter-mediated transfers (P-gp and BCRP transporters). To 
      illustrate the performance of the developed RIV PBPK model on the prediction of 
      drug-drug interactions (DDIs), carbamazepine (CBZ) was selected as a case study 
      due to the high DDI potential. Our study results showed that CBZ significantly 
      reduces the exposure of RIV. The area under the concentration-time curve from 
      zero to infinity (AUC(inf) ) of RIV was reduced by 35.2% (from 2221.3 to 
      1438.7 ng*h/ml) and by 25.5% (from 2467.3 to 1838.4 ng*h/ml) after the first dose 
      and at the steady-state, respectively, whereas the maximum plasma concentration 
      (C(max) ) of RIV was reduced by 37.7% (from 266.3 to 166.1 ng/ml) and 36.4% (from 
      282.3 to 179.5 ng/ml), respectively. The developed PBPK model of RIV could be 
      paired with PBPK models of other interested perpetrators to predict DDI profiles. 
      Further studies investigating the extent of DDI between CBZ and RIV should be 
      conducted in humans to gain a full understanding of their safety and effects.

AB  - The effects of food on the pharmacokinetics (PKs) and safety of 10-mg rivaroxaban 
      tablets in healthy Chinese subjects were investigated from 1 bioequivalence 
      trial. The bioequivalence trial was designed as randomized, open-label, 
      2-sequence, 4-period crossover under both fasted and fed conditions. A total of 
      56 healthy subjects were enrolled, 62.5% were male. These subjects received a 
      single oral 10-mg dose of rivaroxaban with a 7-day washout between 4 periods. 
      Serial PK samples were collected and plasma concentrations were analyzed using 
      validated high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
      Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental methods. The BE 
      module of WinNonLin was used for statistical analysis of the maximum 
      concentration (C(max) ), the area under the concentration-time curve from zero to 
      the final measurable concentration (AUC(0-t) ), and the area under the 
      concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(0-∞) ) of rivaroxaban in 
      plasma. Compared with the fasted state, the C(max) , AUC(0-t) , and AUC(0-∞) of 
      rivaroxaban significantly increased by 47%, 28%, and 26%, respectively, with oral 
      administration of rivaroxaban 10 mg in the fed state. The incidence of adverse 
      events (AEs) was similar between the fasted and fed states, and no serious AEs 
      were observed. Food significantly increased the exposure to rivaroxaban 10 mg in 
      Chinese subjects.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in Chinese deep vein thrombosis 
      patients and the exposure simulation for dosing recommendation.
PG  - 3351-3362
LID - 10.1007/s00210-023-02798-7 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model for 
      rivaroxaban and establish a model-based dosing guideline tailored to Chinese 
      patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A nonlinear mixed-effects modeling 
      approach was employed using Phoenix NLME 7.0 software to construct the PPK model 
      for rivaroxaban. The PK of rivaroxaban was adequately characterized through a 
      one-compartment model. Monte Carlo simulations were employed to formulate dosing 
      guidelines applicable to different patient subgroups. Data from 60 Chinese DVT 
      patients yielded 217 rivaroxaban plasma concentrations for analysis. The apparent 
      clearance (CL/F) of rivaroxaban was found to be significantly influenced by the 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), identified as a major covariate. 
      Based on Monte Carlo simulations, for the acute DVT treatment, a regimen of 
      15 mg, 10 mg, or 5 mg twice daily was associated with the highest total 
      probability target attainment (PTA(total)) in patients with normal, mildly 
      impaired, or moderately impaired renal function, respectively. For the continued 
      DVT treatment, a regimen of 20 mg, 15 mg, or 5 mg once daily exhibited the 
      maximum PTA(total) in patients with normal, mildly impaired, or moderately 
      impaired renal function, respectively. The recommendation label dose achieved the 
      PK target in those with normal renal function. However, for patients with mild or 
      moderate renal impairment, dose adjustments below the label recommendation might 
      be necessary. The PPK model associated CL/F with the covariate eGFR. Utilizing 
      the PPK model, a dosage regimen table was constructed to offer tailored dosing 
      recommendations for Chinese DVT patients.

LID - 10.1007/s40256-020-00434-w [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the USA. 
      Several risk factors have been identified, and obesity has become one of 
      prominent concern. Excessive weight is considered a risk factor for CVD based on 
      evidence linking it to a hypercoagulable state. Considering the prevalence of CVD 
      and obesity in the USA, along with the increased risk for thrombus-related 
      events, anticoagulation plays a significant role in prevention and treatment. 
      Direct oral anticoagulants have taken the place of many traditional 
      anticoagulants. Considering the recently approved indications and continued 
      postmarketing studies conducted with rivaroxaban, this updated review provides 
      data on the overall impact of obesity on this compound. This includes data 
      obtained from both healthy obese volunteers and obese patients with various CVD 
      conditions enrolled in rivaroxaban clinical trials, along with data obtained from 
      postmarketing real-world evidence studies. Assessment of the clinical 
      pharmacology and population pharmacokinetics in obese individuals revealed no 
      clinically relevant effects of increased weight. Additionally, subgroup analyses 
      from each of the pivotal phase III trials supporting the current approved 
      labeling also demonstrated consistent efficacy and safety results in obese 
      patients. Lastly, these findings are further supported by several recent 
      real-world evidence studies assessing the continued effectiveness and safety of 
      rivaroxaban. In conclusion, rivaroxaban's overall pharmacological and clinical 
      profile remained consistent in obese adults when assessed in both drug 
      development and postmarketing studies, supporting the premise that higher weight 
      does not necessitate adjustment in either dose strength or regimen.

TI  - Effects of ticagrelor on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in rats.
PG  - 630-635
LID - 10.1080/13880209.2020.1785510 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Rivaroxaban and ticagrelor are two common drugs for the treatment of 
      atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome. However, the drug-drug 
      interaction between them is still unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects 
      of ticagrelor on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in rats both in vivo and 
      in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sensitive and reliable UPLC-MS/MS method was 
      developed for the determination of rivaroxaban in rat plasma. Ten Sprague-Dawley 
      rats were randomly divided into ticagrelor pre-treated group (10 mg/kg/day for 
      14 days) and control group. The pharmacokinetics of orally administered 
      rivaroxaban (10 mg/kg, single dose) with or without ticagrelor pre-treatment was 
      investigated with developed UPLC-MS/MS method. Additionally, Sprague-Dawley rat 
      liver microsomes were also used to investigate the drug-drug interaction between 
      these two drugs in vitro. RESULTS: The C (max) (221.34 ± 53.33 vs. 
      691.18 ± 238.31 ng/mL) and the AUC((0-t)) (1060.97 ± 291.21 vs. 
      3483.03 ± 753.83 μg·h/L) of rivaroxaban increased significantly (p < 0.05) with 
      ticagrelor pre-treatment. The MRT((0-∞)) of rivaroxaban increased from 
      4.41 ± 0.79 to 5.97 ± 1.11 h, while the intrinsic clearance decreased from 
      9.93 ± 2.55 to 2.89 ± 0.63 L/h/kg (both p < 0.05) after pre-treated with 
      ticagrelor. Enzyme kinetic study indicated that ticagrelor decreased rivaroxaban 
      metabolic clearance with the IC(50) value of 14.04 μmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      in vivo and in vitro results demonstrated that there is a drug-drug interaction 
      between ticagrelor and rivaroxaban in rats. Further studies need to be carried 
      out to verify whether similar interactions truly apply in humans and whether 
      these interactions have clinical significance.

TI  - Rivaroxaban population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling in Iranian 
      patients.
PG  - 1284-1292
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.13673 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Although predictable pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic of rivaroxaban allow fixed dosing regimens without routine 
      coagulation monitoring, there is still the necessity to monitor and predict the 
      effects of rivaroxaban in specific conditions and different populations. The 
      current study was designed and conducted to analyze the rivaroxaban population 
      pharmacokinetics in Iranian patients and establish a 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model to predict the relationship between 
      rivaroxaban concentration and its anticoagulant activity. METHODS: A sequential 
      nonlinear mixed effect pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling method was used 
      to establish the relation between rivaroxaban concentration and anti-factor Xa 
      activity, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) as 
      pharmacodynamic biomarkers in a population of sixty-nine Iranian patients under 
      treatment with oral rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban plasma concentration was quantified 
      by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 
      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The typical population values (inter-individual 
      variability%) of the oral volume of distribution and clearance for a 
      one-compartment model were 61.2 L (21%) and 3.68 L·h(-1) (61%), respectively. 
      Creatinine clearance and Child-Turcotte-Pugh score were found to affect the 
      clearance. A direct link linear structural model best fitted the data for both 
      prothrombin time and aPTT. The baseline estimates of aPTT and prothrombin time in 
      the population were 35.0 (15%) and 12.6 (2%) seconds, respectively. The slope of 
      the relationship between apTT, prothrombin time, and rivaroxaban concentration 
      was 0.033 (28%) and 0.018 (54%) s·ml·ng(-1) , respectively. The selected model 
      for anti-factor Xa activity consisted of a direct link inhibitory E(max) model 
      with Hill coefficient. The maximum level of inhibition (E(max) ) was 4 IU·ml(-1) 
      . The concentration of rivaroxaban producing 50% of the maximum inhibitory effect 
      (EC(50) ) was 180 (24%) ng·ml(-1) , and Hill coefficient (γ) was 1.44 (108%). No 
      covariates showed a statistically significant effect on PT and activated partial 
      thromboplastin time prolonging properties and anti-factor Xa activity. WHAT IS 
      NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed that pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
      models similar to those of the other studies describe the relationship between 
      the rivaroxaban concentration and its anticoagulant effect in Iranian patients. 
      However, considerable differences were observed in the parameters of the 
      pharmacodynamics-pharmacokinetic models with the results of other reports that 
      can explain the unpredictable effects of rivaroxaban in some patients.

PG  - 236-241
LID - 10.1177/15269248211024601 [doi]
AB  - The solid organ transplant community is slow to adopt the routine practice of 
      using direct oral anticoagulants. Rivaroxaban and apixaban share common metabolic 
      pathways with tacrolimus. This study aimed to clarify the impact of 
      rivaroxaban/apixaban on tacrolimus troughs. Fifty solid organ transplant 
      recipients with concomitant use of tacrolimus and rivaroxaban/apixaban were 
      retrospectively assessed for changes in tacrolimus troughs and dose. Average 
      dose-adjusted tacrolimus troughs and average tacrolimus total daily doses prior 
      to and after rivaroxaban/apixaban initiation were compared. Subgroup analyses 
      evaluating rivaroxaban and apixaban individually were performed. Rivaroxaban was 
      prescribed to 18 recipients, and apixaban was prescribed to 32 recipients. 
      Transplanted organs included kidney (n = 22), lung (n = 18), liver (n = 7), 
      simultaneous pancreas and kidney (n = 1), and simultaneous kidney and liver (n = 
      2). The median doseadjusted tacrolimus trough and tacrolimus total daily dose 
      prior to rivaroxaban/apixaban initiation was 2.15 ng/mL/mg (IQR 1.17, 3.37) and 4 
      mg (IQR 1.88, 6.25), respectively. The median dose-adjusted tacrolimus trough and 
      tacrolimus total daily dose after rivaroxaban/apixaban initiation was 2.16 
      ng/mL/mg (IQR 1.24, 4.10) and 3.55 mg (IQR 1.5, 6.35), respectively. No 
      significant difference was found between average dose-adjusted tacrolimus troughs 
      or tacrolimus total daily doses before and after rivaroxaban/apixaban initiation 
      or in the individual subgroup analyses for rivaroxaban/apixaban. It is unlikely 
      that initiating rivaroxaban/apixaban affects tacrolimus troughs or requires 
      tacrolimus dose adjustment. This study does not elucidate if tacrolimus affects 
      rivaroxaban/apixaban pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is a factor Xa inhibitor oral anticoagulant first approved for use in 
      the United States in 2011. Under the drug class commonly termed direct oral 
      anticoagulants, rivaroxaban is approved for the most indications within its 
      class, 7 indications, which are: (1) reduction of risk of stroke and systemic 
      embolism (SE) in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, (2) treatment of deep vein 
      thrombosis (DVT), (3) treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE), (4) reduction in the 
      risk of recurrence of DVT and/or PE, (5) prophylaxis of DVT following hip or knee 
      replacement surgery, (6) prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill 
      medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications not at high risk of 
      bleeding, and (7) reduction of risk of major cardiovascular events in patients 
      with chronic coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease. Considering 
      the relationship between cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, and the use of 
      oral anticoagulants, the following targeted review was created. This review 
      reports the results of the primary pharmacology, pharmacokinetic modeling, 
      clinical safety and efficacy, and real-world postmarketing effectiveness and 
      safety of rivaroxaban in patients with various degrees of renal impairment. Based 
      on these data, rivaroxaban is a viable option for when anticoagulation is needed 
      in patients who have both cardiovascular disease and renal impairment. However, 
      as with any therapy, the benefits and risks of intervention should be carefully 
      assessed and balanced. Patients treated with rivaroxaban for several of its 
      approved indications should have their kidney function assessed prior to and 
      during continued therapy to ensure consistency with the drug label.

AB  - Rivaroxaban (RIV) is an oral anticoagulant that is the first available orally 
      active direct inhibitor of factor Xa. This study focuses on a critical review of 
      the mechanisms of action, characteristics, operations, physicochemical properties 
      of RIV, and analytical methodologies to quantify the concentration of the agent 
      in bulk, pharmaceutical formulations, dissolution media, and biological samples. 
      The major analytical methodology for the determination of RIV is reverse-phase 
      HPLC coupled with UV detection and LC-MS/MS. This technique is particularly 
      beneficial to detect and analyze RIV in plasma samples. The methodologies 
      published in literature until recently were tabulated and the sample preparation 
      techniques prior to analyzes of the biological matrix were discussed. Based on 
      this critical literature screening, it was concluded that the researchers may 
      easily apply or modify the published methodologies depending on their purpose on 
      further studies since the chemical and physical properties of RIV allows this 
      agent to be extracted and analyzed by employing different analytical strategies.

TI  - Effect of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1 Gene Polymorphisms on Rivaroxaban 
      Pharmacokinetics in Patients Undergoing Total Hip and Knee Replacement Surgery.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Population ageing in developed countries will inevitably increase 
      the need for knee and hip replacement surgery. Over the years, direct oral 
      anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban, have been widely used for thromboprophylaxis 
      in patients undergoing knee and hip replacement surgery. The study of 
      pharmacogenetic characteristics of rivaroxaban is important for enhancing the 
      effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban thromboprophylaxis. AIM: Evaluation of 
      CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and ABCB1 gene polymorphisms influence on rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics and prothrombin time dynamics in patients undergoing total hip 
      and knee replacement surgery. METHODS: The study included 78 patients undergoing 
      total hip and knee replacement surgery. The patients received 10 mg of 
      rivaroxaban once a day. Genotyping of polymorphisms ABCB1 rs1045642, ABCB1 
      rs4148738, CYP3A4 rs35599367 and CYP3A5 rs776746 was performed. Peak steady-state 
      and trough steady-state rivaroxaban concentrations were determined. Prothrombin 
      time was also evaluated. RESULTS: The study revealed the following haplotypes: 
      (1) ABCB1 rs1045642-CYP3A4 rs35599367 and (2) ABCB1 rs4148738-CYP3A4 rs35599367. 
      The analysis of the peak steady-state rivaroxaban concentration between mutant 
      haplotypes and wild haplotypes revealed no significant differences. However, 
      there was a statistically significant average correlation between peak 
      steady-state rivaroxaban concentration and prothrombin time (r = 0.421; 
      r(2) = 0.178; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: No significant difference was identified in 
      peak steady-state rivaroxaban concentration between mutant haplotypes and wild 
      haplotypes. The revealed statistically significant average correlation between 
      the prothrombin time and peak steady-state rivaroxaban concentration is important 
      in clinical practice for assessing the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban.

TI  - Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in 
      Patients with Renal Failure.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1007/s13318-018-0501-y [doi]
AB  - A recent survey on the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) revealed that 
      43% of patients with atrial fibrillation and renal impairment were potentially 
      overdosed and had a hazard ratio for major bleeding of 2.19. In this review, we 
      analyse and discuss the effect of renal failure on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of DOACs and of strategies proposed to adjust doses according to 
      the level of renal dysfunction. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of available 
      DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban) differ 
      substantially as regards oral bioavailability, plasma protein binding and the 
      relative involvement of renal and non-renal elimination. In this respect, 80% of 
      dabigatran is excreted as an unchanged drug in urine, whereas edoxaban, 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban and betrixiban are excreted unchanged by, respectively, 50, 
      33, 27 and 11% of the dose. Therefore, drug exposure (the area under the 
      concentration-time curve, AUC) is expected to increase to differing extents, 
      depending on the residual renal function and the contribution of the kidneys to 
      the excretion of each drug. Our analysis found that the increased AUC in patients 
      with severe renal dysfunction was greater than expected in the case of 
      dabigatran, betrixaban and rivaroxaban, indicating that other pharmacokinetic 
      parameters may be altered besides renal clearance. Although DAOC pharmacodynamics 
      do not seem to be altered by renal diseases (the correlation between plasma 
      levels and anticoagulant effects overlaps that of healthy subjects), renal 
      failure per se is associated with an increased risk of bleeding and 
      thromboembolism. Guidelines on dose adjustments in patients with renal 
      dysfunction have been published by three National Drug Agencies (FDA, EMA, HC), 
      but many of their items do not match one another, reflecting our substantial 
      paucity of knowledge in advanced renal failure. Routine monitoring of DOAC 
      anticoagulant effects or plasma concentrations is not recommended, since no 
      validated therapeutic ranges have been established. However, this approach may be 
      useful in emergency situations such as bleeding or thrombotic events, urgent 
      surgery, pharmacokinetic interactions, etc. We conclude that more experimental 
      work is needed to improve our knowledge of DOAC pharmacology in renal failure and 
      to provide clinicians with valid tools to adjust therapy.

TI  - Insights into the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Direct Oral 
      Anticoagulants in Older Adults with Atrial Fibrillation: A Structured Narrative 
      Review.
PG  - 351-373
LID - 10.1007/s40262-023-01222-w [doi]
AB  - Older adults, the fastest growing population, represent almost 50% of all users 
      of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Unfortunately, we have very little 
      relevant pharmacological and clinical data on DOACs, especially in older adults 
      with geriatric profiles. This is highly relevant as pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) often differ substantially in this population. Hence, we 
      need to obtain a better understanding of the PK/PD of DOACs in older adults, to 
      ensure appropriate treatment. This review summarises the current insights into 
      PK/PD of DOACs in older adults. A search was undertaken up to October 2022 to 
      identify PK/PD studies of apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, that 
      included older adults aged ≥ 75 years. This review identified 44 articles. Older 
      age alone did not influence exposure of edoxaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran, 
      while apixaban peak concentrations were 40% higher in older adults than in young 
      volunteers. Nevertheless, high interindividual variability in DOAC exposure in 
      older adults was noted, which can be explained by distinctive older patient 
      characteristics, such as kidney function, changes in body composition (especially 
      reduced muscle mass), and co-medication with P-gp inhibitors, which is in line 
      with the current dosing reduction criteria of apixaban, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban. Dabigatran had the largest interindividual variability among all 
      DOACs since its dose adjustment criterion is only age, and thus it is not a 
      preferable option. Additionally, DOAC exposure, which fell outside of on-therapy 
      ranges, was significantly related to stroke and bleeding events. No definite 
      thresholds linked to these outcomes in older adults have been established.

TI  - Perpetrator effects of ciclosporin (P-glycoprotein inhibitor) and its combination 
      with fluconazole (CYP3A inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in 
      healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1528-1537
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13934 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Rivaroxaban exposure is considerably increased by drugs that are combined 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitors (e.g. 
      ketoconazole). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the 
      potent P-gp inhibitor ciclosporin and its combination with the moderate CYP3A 
      inhibitor fluconazole on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and on CYP3A activity. 
      METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers received 20 mg rivaroxaban orally alone, in 
      combination with ciclosporin (dose-individualized oral regimen), and in 
      combination with ciclosporin and fluconazole (400 mg day(-1) orally). CYP3A4 
      activity was estimated using a midazolam microdose. Pharmacokinetics was analysed 
      using noncompartmental and compartmental methods. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, 
      ciclosporin increased rivaroxaban average exposure by 47% (90% confidence 
      interval 28-68%), maximum concentration by 104% (70-146%), and decreased CYP3A4 
      activity by 34% (25-42%). Ciclosporin combined with fluconazole increased 
      rivaroxaban average exposure by 86% (58-119%) and maximum concentration by 115% 
      (83-153%), which was considerably stronger than observed in historical controls 
      receiving rivaroxaban with fluconazole alone, and decreased CYP3A4 activity by 
      79% (76-82%). CONCLUSION: Patients treated with rivaroxaban in combination with 
      single modulators of multiple elimination pathways or multiple modulators of 
      single elimination pathways (CYP3A, P-gp) require particular care.

TI  - Safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban--an 
      oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor--are not affected by aspirin.
PG  - 981-90
AB  - Rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) is an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor in advanced 
      clinical development for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic 
      disorders. This was a randomized, 2-way crossover study in healthy male subjects, 
      with an aspirin run-in period, to examine whether aspirin influences the safety, 
      tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. All 
      treatments were well tolerated; drug-related adverse events were mild and 
      transient. Aspirin did not alter the effects of rivaroxaban on Factor Xa activity 
      or clotting tests. Platelet aggregation and bleeding time were not affected by 
      rivaroxaban, and rivaroxaban did not influence the effects of aspirin on these 
      parameters to a clinically relevant extent. Aspirin did not affect the 
      pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban, including the fraction unbound. This study 
      suggests that there is no clinically relevant interaction between rivaroxaban and 
      aspirin and that the 2 drugs could be administered concomitantly at the doses 
      used in this study.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban--an oral, direct 
      factor Xa inhibitor--in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.
PG  - 203-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a clinical need for novel oral anticoagulants with 
      predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Rivaroxaban is an oral direct 
      Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor in clinical development for the prevention and 
      treatment of thromboembolic disorders. This analysis was performed to 
      characterize the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban 
      in patients participating in two phase II, double-blind, randomized, 
      active-comparator-controlled studies of twice-daily rivaroxaban for the 
      prevention of venous thromboembolism after total hip- or knee-replacement 
      surgery. METHODS: Sparse blood samples were taken from all patients participating 
      in the studies (n = 1009). In addition, a subset of patients in the hip study (n 
      = 36) underwent full profiling. Rivaroxaban plasma concentrations, FXa activity 
      and the prothrombin time were determined. Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling was 
      used to model the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      rivaroxaban. RESULTS: An oral one-compartment model described the population 
      pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban well. On the first postoperative day only, 
      categorization of patients as slow or fast absorbers as a tool to address 
      variability in absorption improved the fit of the model. Clearance of rivaroxaban 
      was lower and more variable on the first postoperative day, and so time was 
      factored into the model. Overall, the only major difference between the models 
      for the hip study and the knee study was that clearance was 26% lower in the knee 
      study, resulting in approximately 30% higher exposure. Residual variability in 
      the models was moderate (37% and 34% in the hip and knee studies, respectively). 
      Plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban increased dose dependently. Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters that were estimated using the models agreed closely with results from 
      full-profile patients in the hip study, demonstrating that rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics are predictable. The pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban were 
      affected by expected covariates: age affected clearance in the hip study only, 
      haematocrit (on the first postoperative day only) and gender affected clearance 
      in the knee study only, and renal function affected clearance in both studies. 
      Bodyweight affected the volume of distribution in both studies. However, the 
      effects of covariates on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban were generally 
      small, and predictions of 'extreme' case scenarios suggested that fixed dosing of 
      rivaroxaban was likely to be possible. FXa activity and the prothrombin time were 
      both affected by surgery, probably because of perioperative bleeding and 
      intravenous administration of fluids; therefore, time was included in the 
      pharmacodynamic models. In both studies, FXa activity correlated with rivaroxaban 
      plasma concentrations following a maximum effect model, whereas prothrombin time 
      prolongation correlated following a linear model with intercept. The slope of the 
      prothrombin time prolongation correlation was 3.2 seconds/(100 microg/L) in the 
      hip study and 4.2 seconds/(100 microg/L) in the knee study. Both pharmacodynamic 
      models in both studies demonstrated low residual variability of approximately 
      10%. CONCLUSION: This population analysis in patients undergoing major 
      orthopaedic surgery demonstrated that rivaroxaban has predictable, dose-dependent 
      pharmacokinetics that were well described by an oral one-compartment model and 
      affected by expected covariates. Rivaroxaban exposure could be assessed using the 
      prothrombin time, if necessary, but not the international normalized ratio. The 
      findings suggested that fixed dosing of rivaroxaban may be possible in patients 
      undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.

TI  - Dosing Regimen Prediction and Confirmation With Rivaroxaban for 
      Thromboprophylaxis in Children After the Fontan Procedure: Insights From the 
      Phase III UNIVERSE Study.
PG  - 220-231
LID - 10.1002/jcph.1966 [doi]
AB  - Thrombosis remains an important complication for children with single-ventricle 
      physiology following the Fontan procedure, and effective thromboprophylaxis is an 
      important unmet medical need. To obviate conventional dose-finding studies and 
      expedite clinical development, a rivaroxaban dose regimen for this indication was 
      determined using a model-informed drug development approach. A physiologically 
      based pharmacokinetic rivaroxaban model was used to predict a pediatric dosing 
      regimen that would produce drug exposures similar to that of 10 mg once daily in 
      adults. This regimen was used in an open-label, multicenter phase III study, 
      which investigated the use of rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis in post-Fontan 
      patients 2 to 8 years of age. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of rivaroxaban was 
      assessed in part A (n = 12) and in part B (n = 64) of the UNIVERSE study. The 
      safety and efficacy in the rivaroxaban group were compared to those in the 
      acetylsalicylic acid group for 12 months. Pharmacodynamic end points were 
      assessed in both parts of the study. Rivaroxaban exposures achieved in parts A 
      and B were similar to the adult reference exposures. Prothrombin time also showed 
      similarity to the adult reference. Exposure-response analysis did not identify a 
      quantitative relationship between rivaroxaban exposures and efficacy/safety 
      outcomes within the observed exposure ranges. A body weight-based dose regimen 
      selected by physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling was shown in the 
      UNIVERSE study to be appropriate for thromboprophylaxis in the post-Fontan 
      pediatric population. Model-based dose selection can support pediatric drug 
      development and bridge adult dose data to pediatrics, thereby obviating the need 
      for dose-finding studies in pediatric programs.

TI  - Rivaroxaban and apixaban in orthopaedics: is there a difference in their plasma 
      concentrations and anticoagulant effects?
PG  - 925-33
LID - 10.1097/MBC.0000000000000371 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to improve knowledge of what happens in the coagulation 
      of orthopaedic patients under rivaroxaban and apixaban, in order to finalize and 
      cross-validate effective measurement methods and to provide arguments for helping 
      to reference one or the other drug in our central pharmacy. One hundred and two 
      patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement were included. Half of them 
      received rivaroxaban and the other half received apixaban. Blood samples (n = 244 
      with each drug) were taken at Cmax preoperatively and twice a week, apart from 
      the day of the patient's discharge, when Ctrough concentration was targeted. 
      Routine coagulation parameters, and functional and liquid chromatography tandem 
      mass spectrometry assays for measurement of circulating concentrations were 
      studied. The LC-MS/MS assay and the functional assays carried out in patients 
      under routine conditions were highly correlated, apart from low concentrations 
      (<30 ng/ml), which were affected by the variable individual potential to inhibit 
      the exogenous bovine Xa used in the functional assays. After 1 week of treatment, 
      the drugs differed: Cmax and Ctrough were closer when apixaban was taken twice 
      daily (83 ± 39 and 58 ± 17 ng/ml) than with rivaroxaban taken once a day 
      (113 ± 67 and 13 ± 20 ng/ml). Rivaroxaban had a greater influence on routine 
      coagulation tests and reduced the maximum thrombin concentration more 
      efficiently, as assessed by the thrombin generation test. Although rivaroxaban 
      and apixaban present apparently similar constant rates, they exhibit significant 
      differences in their concentrations and anticoagulant effects when studied ex 
      vivo in orthopedic patients.

TI  - Mutant CYP3A4/5 Correlated with Clinical Outcomes by Affecting Rivaroxaban 
      Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 1315-1325
LID - 10.1007/s10557-023-07495-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to investigate the impact of single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism-encoded cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4/5) on clinical outcomes of 
      rivaroxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) based on 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) aspects. METHOD: A prospective 
      study enrolling 165 rivaroxaban-treated patients with NVAF was conducted. 
      Genotyping of CYP3A4 (rs2242480, rs2246709, rs3735451, and rs4646440) and CYP3A5 
      (rs776746) was performed to explore their impact on the trough plasma 
      concentrations (C(trough)) of rivaroxaban, coagulation indicators at the 
      C(trough) including activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin 
      time (PT), and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Patients with mutant genotype CYP3A4 
      (rs2242480, rs2246709, and rs3735451) and CYP3A5 (rs776746) had higher levels of 
      rivaroxaban C(trough), PT values than that of wild-type. Furthermore, a positive 
      relationship was revealed between C(trough) and PT (r = 0.212, p = 0.007), while 
      no significant correlation was found between C(trough) and APTT. Regarding the 
      clinical outcomes, the minor allele carriers on rs3735451 and the minor allele 
      (A) carriers on rs2246709 were associated with higher incidence of minor bleeding 
      (p = 0.028 and p = 0.038, respectively) and were identified as the independent 
      risk factors of minor bleeding treated with rivaroxaban (p = 0.024 and p = 0.036, 
      respectively), with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve validated 
      (AUC = 0.8956, 95% CI: 0.829-0.962). CONCLUSION: The CYP3A4 polymorphisms 
      (rs2242480, rs2246709, and rs3735451) and CYP3A5 rs776746 were associated with 
      variations in rivaroxaban PK/PD. The minor allele (C) carriers on rs3735451 and 
      the minor allele (A) carriers on rs2246709 were correlated with clinical 
      outcomes.

PG  - 453-61
AB  - Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor in advanced clinical 
      development for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. The aim 
      was to compare the population pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 
      twice-daily (bid) and once-daily (od) rivaroxaban in patients undergoing total 
      hip replacement (THR). Blood samples were collected from patients enrolled in two 
      phase IIb, dose-ranging studies undertaken to investigate rivaroxaban for 
      thromboprophylaxis after THR. A sparse sampling technique was used and the 
      samples were pooled for PK and PD analysis, which used non-linear mixed effect 
      modelling. Rivaroxaban PK (samples from 758 patients) were well described by an 
      oral, one-compartment model; age and renal function influenced clearance, and 
      body surface area affected volume of distribution. When comparing the same total 
      daily doses, maximum plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban were higher and minimum 
      plasma concentrations were lower with od dosing, compared with bid dosing; 
      however, the 90% intervals overlapped. The area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve was 18-30% higher in the od than in the bid study. 
      Prothrombin time in seconds (samples from 1181 patients) correlated with 
      rivaroxaban plasma concentrations in a linear fashion in both studies. In 
      conclusion, the PK and PD of rivaroxaban were predictable when given either bid 
      or od. These findings, along with the suggested efficacy and safety of 
      rivaroxaban in the phase II studies, relative to enoxaparin, supported the 
      selection of a convenient, once-daily 10 mg rivaroxaban dose for investigation in 
      phase III studies.

AB  - There is a real and viable need in the anticoagulant arena for a safe, robust, 
      effective oral anticoagulant drug that measures up to warfarin in providing 
      protection against thrombosis and compares favorably (if not better) with regard 
      to safety profile, without the need for routine and often cumbersome monitoring. 
      Many potential antithrombotic agents are in development, and the oral factor Xa 
      inhibitors are one such class of drug. By inhibiting both free and clot-bound 
      factor Xa complexes, the oral factor Xa inhibitors prolong activated partial 
      thromboplastin time and prothrombin times in a dose-dependent manner without the 
      need for antithrombin, thus differing from drugs such as fondaparinux, heparin, 
      etc. Early human experiments demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic profile with good absorbtion, effective inhibition of factor Xa 
      activity and no significant accumulation of the drug in the body. Other studies 
      on healthy human volunteers showed an efficacious antithrombotic profile, minimal 
      interactions with food, fasting and concomitant antiplatelet-drug (aspirin and 
      naproxen) administration, and effectiveness in extremes of body weight (>120 kg). 
      Rivaroxaban has been tested in trials to prevent and treat venous 
      thromboembolism, and the results were indicative of a safe, effective and 
      therapeutic pharmacological profile. Results so far from phase III studies 
      currently underway that assess the role of rivaroxaban in preventing arterial 
      thromboembolism in both high-risk atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome 
      patients will be the focus of interest and indeed intense speculation as to 
      whether we should modify our current practice in favor of using a more convenient 
      and effective pharmacological agent.

TI  - Population model of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban--an 
      oral, direct factor xa inhibitor--in healthy subjects.
PG  - 335-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) is an oral, direct Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor 
      being developed for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. 
      This analysis aimed to define population models for the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
      pharmacodynamics (PD) ofrivaroxaban in healthy males. METHODS: Non-linear, 
      mixed-effect modeling was used to analyze rivaroxaban plasma concentration and PD 
      data (FXa activity and clotting tests) from subjects in a phase I, 
      multiple-ascending-dose study. Subjects received 5 mg rivaroxaban once, twice or 
      three times daily, or 10, 20 or 30 mg rivaroxaban twice daily. RESULTS: The 
      population PK of rivaroxaban were well described by an oral, two-compartment 
      model with first-order absorption and elimination from the central compartment. 
      Population mean estimates for apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution 
      for the central compartment were 9.2 1/h and 55 1, respectively, with moderate 
      inter-individual variability (17.4% and 30.7%, respectively). Total volume of 
      distribution for rivaroxaban at steady state was approximately 70 1. Residual 
      (unexplained) variability was 25%. FXa activity correlated with rivaroxaban 
      plasma concentrations following an inhibitory Emax model; prothrombin time (PT) 
      and rivaroxaban plasma concentrations correlated with a linear model, with a 
      slope of 4.6 s/(100 microg/1). Inter-individual variability was low for the 
      correlation with PT. The models derived were used to define sampling windows for 
      population PK/PD modeling in Phase II studies. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis 
      confirms that rivaroxaban has predictable, dose-proportional PK and PD. The 
      linear correlation between rivaroxaban plasma concentrations and PT suggests that 
      this test might be useful to assess rivaroxaban exposure in patients, if 
      required.

AB  - Rivaroxaban, an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor, is a small molecule drug 
      capable of inhibiting not only free factor Xa with high selectivity but also 
      prothrombinase-bound and clot-associated factor Xa in a concentration-dependent 
      manner. Clinical studies have demonstrated predictable anticoagulation and 
      confirmed dose-proportional effects for rivaroxaban in humans with a rapid onset 
      (within 2-4 h) and a half-life of 7-11 h and 11-13 h for young and elderly 
      subjects, respectively. For a 10 mg dose, the oral bioavailability of rivaroxaban 
      is high (80-100%) and is not affected by food intake. These favourable 
      pharmacological properties underpin the use of rivaroxaban in fixed dosing 
      regimens, with no need for dose adjustment or routine coagulation monitoring. 
      Rivaroxaban has a dual mode of excretion with the renal route accounting for 
      one-third of the overall elimination of unchanged active drug. Rivaroxaban is a 
      substrate of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein and therefore not recommended for 
      concomitant use with strong inhibitors of both pathways, e.g. most azole 
      antimycotics and protease inhibitors. Rivaroxaban is currently approved for the 
      prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adult patients undergoing elective 
      hip or knee replacement surgery. Studies using 10 mg rivaroxaban once daily in 
      this indication demonstrated its suitability for a wide range of patients 
      regardless of age, gender or body weight. Further studies in the treatment of 
      VTE, prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary 
      syndrome, prevention of stroke in those with atrial fibrillation and prevention 
      of VTE in hospitalized medically ill patients have been reported or are ongoing.

AB  - The health implications of obesity are myriad and multifaceted. Physiologic 
      changes associated with obesity can affect the absorption, distribution, 
      metabolism, and excretion of administered drugs, thereby altering their 
      pharmacologic profiles. In 2016, the Scientific and Standardization Committee of 
      the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis published recommendations 
      about the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in obese patients. This 
      guidance provides uniform recommendations for all DOACs, yet data suggest that 
      individual agents may be affected to different degrees by obesity. Moreover, 
      there are no recommendations currently available to guide DOAC use in bariatric 
      surgery patients, in whom anatomic and physiologic changes to the digestive 
      system can influence drug pharmacokinetics. Our review of the available 
      literature indicates that the clinical profile of the DOAC rivaroxaban is not 
      affected by high weight or bariatric surgery; hence, it does not appear that 
      rivaroxaban dosing needs to be altered in these patient populations.

AB  - A randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was 
      conducted to assess the effect of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban - an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor. Subjects 
      (n = 34) were enrolled into four groups: young males or females (aged 18-45 
      years) and elderly males or females (aged >75 years), and received a single dose 
      of 10 mg rivaroxaban. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were 
      determined. Gender had no significant influence on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban. The area under the concentration-time curve 
      (AUC) of rivaroxaban was 41% higher in elderly compared with young subjects; 
      corresponding AUC values for the inhibition of Factor Xa activity and 
      prolongation of prothrombin time were also higher. These changes were the result 
      of reduced rivaroxaban clearance in elderly subjects, mainly owing to decreased 
      renal function. The influence of age was not considered clinically relevant. The 
      maximum plasma concentration was not increased in elderly subjects, and 
      pharmacodynamic parameters returned close to baseline within 24 hours. The 
      results indicate that age alone and gender did not have a clinically relevant 
      effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in healthy 
      subjects after a 10 mg dose.

TI  - Rivaroxaban and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Bleeding risk resulting 
      from their concomitant use.
PG  - 10-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The combination of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with  
      rivaroxaban may result in a dual interaction (pharmacokinetic 
      and pharmacodynamic) depending on the type of selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitor employed (CYP3A4-inhibiting vs. non-CYP3A4 inhibiting).  
      The purpose of this study was to use real world data to determine if the type of  
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used plays a role in the risk and severity 
      of bleeding in patients receiving rivaroxaban. Method: This was a single-center 
      retrospective longitudinal observational study carried out between January 2016 
      and February 2020 in patients aged 18 years or older treated concurrently with 
      rivaroxaban (prescribed for treatments) and a selective serotonin reuptake  
      nhibitor. Patients were divided into two groups according to the selective  
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor they received, i.e., a CYP3A4 inhibitor (group 1):  
      sertraline, fluoxetine and paroxetine, or a non-CYP3A4 inhibitor (group 
      2): citalopram and escitalopram. We analyzed the bleeding events and  
      everity, the daily dose of rivaroxaban used and the medication 
      administered concomitantly. RESULTS: A total of 146 patients were included (89 in 
      group 1 and 57 in group  2) and 35 bleeding events (24% of patients) were 
      identified, of  which 12 were  major and 23 were minor. The bleeding rate was 
      higher in group 1  (25.8% vs 21.0%) but there were no differences in major 
      bleeding (10.1% vs  5.3%; p = 0.235) or minor bleeding (13.5% vs 15.8%; p = 
      0.496). The  bleeding rate with a daily rivaroxaban dose of 20 mg was 9% (8/89) 
      in group 1  and 14% (8/57) in group 2 (p = 0.2137), as compared with 16.9% 
      (15/89)  in group 1 versus 7% (4/57) in group 2 (p = 0.042) for a daily 15 mg 
      dose. CONCLUSIONS: Although the type of selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitor used  concurrently with rivaroxaban was not found to influence the 
      patients' bleeding  risk, a significant increase in the risk of bleeding was  
      bserved based on the dose of rivaroxaban used.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      rivaroxaban, an oral, direct Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor, in healthy, male Chinese 
      subjects. METHODS: Two randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, 
      dose-escalation studies were conducted in healthy Chinese men aged 18-45 years. 
      In the single-dose study, subjects received single, oral doses of rivaroxaban 
      2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg. In the multiple-dose study, oral rivaroxaban was 
      administered in doses of 5, 10, 20 and 30 mg twice daily for 6 days. RESULTS: 
      Rivaroxaban, in single and multiple doses up to 60 mg, was well tolerated. Rapid 
      absorption was observed in both studies (time to C(max) 1.25-2.5 h). In the 
      multiple-dose study, rivaroxaban exposure increased dose-proportionally after the 
      first dose and at steady state (for the 5-20-mg doses). The half-life of 
      rivaroxaban was up to 7.9 h in the single-dose study. Maximal inhibition of FXa 
      activity was achieved within 1-3 h of dosing in the single-dose study [at 20 mg 
      FXa inhibition as a median percentage change from baseline, 45.92; 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 44.64, 50.70] and 2-3 h after administration at steady state in the 
      multiple-dose study (at 20 mg median FXa inhibition as a median percentage change 
      from baseline, 60.25; 95% CI 56.16, 63.05), in line with maximum rivaroxaban 
      plasma concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Rivaroxaban demonstrated predictable 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy Chinese subjects, in line with 
      findings observed previously in White subjects. This suggests that fixed doses of 
      rivaroxaban may be administered to all patients, regardless of their ethnic 
      origin.

AB  - Furmonertinib, a third generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), is used for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
      Rivaroxaban and apixaban are direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) used for venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE), which is a frequent comorbid with NSCLC. They are 
      substrates of CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP, whereas furmonertinib is an inhibitor of 
      P-gp and BCRP. This study aimed to disclose the extent of effect of furmonertinib 
      on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban or apixaban. Rats were divided into four 
      groups (n = 6) that received rivaroxaban (group 1), furmonertinib and rivaroxaban 
      (group 2), apixaban (group 3), furmonertinib and apixaban (group 4). The 
      concentrations of drugs were measured by an ultra-performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Furmonertinib increased the 
      C(max) and AUC(0-t) of rivaroxaban by 1.66 and 2.07-fold, whereas decreased the 
      CL(z)/F by 1.70-fold and V(z)/F 1.27-fold. Furthermore, furmonertinib caused 
      similar changes in apixaban pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetic results suggest 
      that it is essential to alert the effect of furmonertinib on the pharmacokinetics 
      of rivaroxaban or apixaban in clinical practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban--a novel, oral, direct Factor Xa (FXa) 
      inhibitor--in healthy elderly subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this 
      single-centre, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-escalation 
      study, 48 subjects (aged 60-76 years) were randomized to receive a single oral 
      dose of 30, 40 or 50 mg of rivaroxaban or placebo. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban was 
      absorbed rapidly, reaching peak plasma concentration (C(max)) 4 h after dosing in 
      all groups. Bioavailability, in terms of the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) and C(max), increased slightly (less than dose 
      proportionally) after administration of rivaroxaban 40 mg compared with 30 mg, 
      but was not increased further with rivaroxaban 50 mg. Rivaroxaban pharmacodynamic 
      effects (inhibition of FXa activity and prolongation of prothrombin time, 
      activated partial thromboplastin time and HepTest) all showed a similar pattern, 
      with maximum inhibition of FXa activity increasing from 68% after rivaroxaban 30 
      mg to 75% after 40 mg and no further increase with the 50 mg dose. Most adverse 
      events were mild; observed rates were less than placebo for the 30 and 40 mg dose 
      groups, and similar to placebo for 50 mg. No differences were found between male 
      and female subjects. Effects of rivaroxaban doses above 50 mg were not 
      investigated in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Each single dose of rivaroxaban was well 
      tolerated, with predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics at doses up to 
      40 mg, and provided effective anticoagulation in healthy elderly subjects. 
      Adverse events were somewhat elevated in the 50 mg group, but given the small 
      sample size, no specific conclusions can be drawn about this dosing level.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetics of Rivaroxaban in Chinese Patients with Non-Valvular 
      Atrial Fibrillation: A Prospective Multicenter Study.
PG  - 881-893
LID - 10.1007/s40262-022-01108-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Rivaroxaban is a novel oral anticoagulant widely used 
      for thromboprophylaxis in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). 
      The present study aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model for 
      rivaroxaban in Chinese patients with NVAF. METHODS: We performed a prospective 
      multicenter study. The plasma concentration of rivaroxaban was directly detected 
      by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) 
      and indirectly by rivaroxaban-calibrated chromogenic anti-Xa assay (STA(®)). Gene 
      polymorphisms were detected by MassARRAY single nucleotide polymorphism 
      genotyping technology. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was used to develop the 
      PPK model for rivaroxaban in patients with NVAF, and we simulated the 
      steady-state rivaroxaban exposures under different dosing strategies in different 
      covariate levels. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients from five centers were 
      recruited, including 263 plasma concentrations detected by HPLC-MS/MS, 2626 gene 
      polymorphisms, and 131 plasma concentrations detected by anti-Xa assay. In our 
      study, an oral one-compartment model was used to describe the pharmacokinetics of 
      rivaroxaban in patients with NVAF. In the final model, the estimated apparent 
      clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F) were 5.79 L/h (relative 
      standard error [RSE] 4.4%) and 51.5 L (RSE 5.0%), respectively. Covariates in the 
      final model included creatinine clearance, total bilirubin, rs4728709, and body 
      weight. The simulation results showed that in the 15 mg once-daily dosing 
      regimen, in most instances the maximum plasma concentration at steady state 
      (C(max,ss)) and trough plasma concentration at steady state (C(min,ss)) were in 
      the target range for different covariate levels. When patients were administered 
      rivaroxaban 15 or 20 mg once daily, the C(max,ss) and C(min,ss) in the different 
      bodyweight levels were also in the target range. For patients with the ABCB1 
      rs4728709 mutation, the C(min,ss) in the 10, 15, and 20 mg once-daily dosing 
      regimens were lower than the target range. The anti-Xa assay was highly linearly 
      correlated with the HPLC-MS/MS method [y = 1.014x - 2.4648 (R(2) = 0.97)]. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study was the first multicenter PPK model for rivaroxaban in 
      Chinese patients with NVAF (Alfalfa-RIVAAF-PPK). The study found that 15 mg once 
      daily may be suitable as the principal rivaroxaban dose for Chinese patients with 
      NVAF. For patients with the rs4728709 mutation, it may be necessary to examine 
      insufficient anticoagulation. We found that the rivaroxaban-calibrated 
      chromogenic anti-Xa assay and HPLC-MS/MS method were highly linearly correlated. 
      Prospective studies with larger sample sizes and real-world studies are needed 
      for further verification.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is a novel, oral, direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor for the prevention 
      and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 
      rivaroxaban in healthy, elderly Chinese subjects. In this single-centre, 
      single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-escalation study, 79 
      subjects, aged 59-74years (mean 62.8), were randomised to receive once-daily oral 
      doses of rivaroxaban 5, 10, 20, 30 or 40mg. Rivaroxaban was well tolerated: there 
      was a low incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and all events were of 
      mild intensity. Rivaroxaban was absorbed rapidly, reaching maximum plasma 
      concentrations within 2-4hours. The PK of rivaroxaban were dose dependent over 
      the dose range tested. Maximal inhibition of FXa occurred 2-3hours after dosing 
      and returned to baseline after 24-48hours, reflecting rivaroxaban plasma 
      concentrations. Inhibition of FXa was associated with dose-dependent effects on 
      global clotting tests. There were no clinically relevant differences in 
      rivaroxaban plasma concentrations between male and female subjects. In 
      conclusion, rivaroxaban was well tolerated and was found to have predictable PK 
      and PD in healthy, elderly Chinese subjects.

AB  - When used in real-world conditions, substantial interindividual variations in 
      direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) plasma concentrations are observed for a given 
      dose, leading to a risk of over- or under-exposure and clinically significant 
      adverse events. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models could help 
      physicians to tailor DOAC prescriptions in vulnerable patient populations, such 
      as those in the hospital setting. The present study aims to validate 
      prospectively PBPK models for rivaroxaban and apixaban in a large cohort of 
      elderly, polymorbid, and hospitalized patients. In using a model of geriatric 
      population integrating appropriate physiological parameters into models first 
      optimized with healthy volunteer data, observed plasma concentration collected in 
      hospitalized patients on apixaban (n = 100) and rivaroxaban (n = 100) were 
      adequately predicted (ratio predicted/observed area under the concentration curve 
      for a dosing interval [AUC(tau) ] = 0.97 [0.96-0.99] geometric mean, 90% 
      confidence interval, ratio predicted/observed AUC(tau)  = 1.03 [1.02-1.05]) for 
      apixaban and rivaroxaban, respectively. Validation of the present PBPK models for 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban in in-patients represent an additional step toward the 
      feasibility of bedside use.

TI  - The Effect of Levetiracetam Compared with Enzyme-Inducing Antiseizure Medications 
      on Apixaban and Rivaroxaban Peak Plasma Concentrations.
PG  - 399-408
LID - 10.1007/s40263-024-01077-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Post-stroke epilepsy represents an important clinical 
      challenge as it often requires both treatment with direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) and antiseizure medications (ASMs). Levetiracetam (LEV), an ASM not known 
      to induce metabolizing enzymes, has been suggested as a safer alternative to 
      enzyme-inducing (EI)-ASMs in patients treated with DOACs; however, current 
      clinical guidelines suggest caution when LEV is used with DOACs because of 
      possible P-glycoprotein induction and competition (based on preclinical studies). 
      We investigated whether LEV affects apixaban and rivaroxaban concentrations 
      compared with two control groups: (a) patients treated with EI-ASMs and (b) 
      patients not treated with any ASM. METHODS: In this retrospective observational 
      study, we monitored apixaban and rivaroxaban peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) 
      in 203 patients treated with LEV (n = 28) and with EI-ASM (n = 33), and in 
      patients not treated with any ASM (n = 142). Enzyme-inducing ASMs included 
      carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, and oxcarbazepine. We 
      collected clinical and laboratory data for analysis, and DOAC C(max) of patients 
      taking LEV were compared with the other two groups. RESULTS: In 203 patients, 55% 
      were female and the mean age was 78 ± 0.8 years. One hundred and eighty-six 
      patients received apixaban and 17 patients received rivaroxaban. The proportion 
      of patients with DOAC C(max) below their therapeutic range was 7.1% in the LEV 
      group, 10.6% in the non-ASM group, and 36.4% in the EI-ASM group (p < 0.001). The 
      odds of having DOAC C(max) below the therapeutic range (compared with control 
      groups) was not significantly different in patients taking LEV (adjusted odds 
      ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.19-2.67, p = 0.61), but it was 12.7-fold 
      higher in patients taking EI-ASM (p < 0.001). In an analysis in patients treated 
      with apixaban, there was no difference in apixaban C(max) between patients 
      treated with LEV and non-ASM controls, and LEV clinical use was not associated 
      with variability in apixaban C(max) in a multivariate linear regression. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we show that unlike EI-ASMs, LEV clinical use was not 
      significantly associated with lower apixaban C(max) and was similar to that in 
      patients not treated with any ASM. Our findings suggest that the combination of 
      LEV with apixaban and rivaroxaban may not be associated with decreased apixaban 
      and rivaroxaban C(max). Therefore, prospective controlled studies are required to 
      examine the possible non-pharmacokinetic mechanism of the effect of the 
      LEV-apixaban or LEV-rivaroxaban combination on patients' outcomes.

TI  - Predicting drug-drug interactions with physiologically based 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and optimal dosing of apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban with dronedarone co-administration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The concurrent administration of dronedarone and oral anti-coagulants 
      is common because both are used in managing atrial fibrillation (AF). Dronedarone 
      is a moderate inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme and 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Apixaban and rivaroxaban are P-gp and CYP3A4 substrates. 
      This study aims to investigate the impact of exposure and bleeding risk of 
      apixaban or rivaroxaban when co-administered with dronedarone using 
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis. METHODS: Modeling 
      and simulation were conducted using Simcyp® Simulator. The parameters required 
      for dronedarone modeling were collected from the literature. The developed 
      dronedarone physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was verified using 
      reported drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between dronedarone and CYP3A4 and P-gp 
      substrates. The model was applied to evaluate the DDI potential of dronedarone on 
      the exposure of apixaban 5 mg every 12 h or rivaroxaban 20 mg every 24 h in 
      geriatric and renally impaired populations. DDIs precipitating major bleeding 
      risks were assessed using exposure-response analyses derived from literature. 
      RESULTS: The model accurately described the pharmacokinetics of orally 
      administered dronedarone in healthy subjects and accurately predicted DDIs 
      between dronedarone and four CYP3A4 and P-gp substrates with fold errors &lt;1.5. 
      Dronedarone co-administration led to a 1.29 (90 % confidence interval (CI): 
      1.14-1.50) to 1.31 (90 % CI: 1.12-1.46)-fold increase in the area under 
      concentration-time curve for rivaroxaban and 1.33 (90 % CI: 1.15-1.68) to 1.46 
      (90 % CI: 1.24-1.92)-fold increase for apixaban. The PD model indicated that 
      dronedarone co-administration might potentiate the mean major bleeding risk of 
      apixaban with a 1.45 to 1.95-fold increase. However, the mean major bleeding risk 
      of rivaroxaban was increased by &lt;1.5-fold in patients with normal or impaired 
      renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Dronedarone co-administration increased the exposure 
      of rivaroxaban and apixaban and might potentiate major bleeding risks. Reduced 
      apixaban and rivaroxaban dosing regimens are recommended when dronedarone is 
      co-administered to patients with AF.

LID - 10.1177/1076029613494468 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban (Xarelto, Bayer HealthCare, Leverkusen, Germany) is a new 
      oral anticoagulant drug. Anticoagulants may cause bleeding, thereby requiring 
      reliable monitoring and efficient therapy. We investigated thromboelastometry 
      versus routine coagulation tests to measure prophylactic and therapeutic 
      concentrations of rivaroxaban and their reversal with prothrombin complex 
      concentrate (PCC) and activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa) in vitro. 
      METHODS: Rivaroxaban was solubilized, and PCC and rFVIIa were added in 2 
      concentrations to the rivaroxaban-spiked blood samples, and thromboelastometry 
      and measurements were performed. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban increased tissue 
      factor-activated clotting time (CT(ExTEM)) dose dependently. Activated partial 
      prothrombin time (aPTT), prothrombin time ratio (PTR), and prothrombin time (PT) 
      were changed significantly in both concentrations. Reversal with PCC in both 
      dosages caused no significant change in the measured parameters. For prophylactic 
      rivaroxaban dosage, rFVIIa changed the PT significantly but not CT(ExTEM), aPTT, 
      and PTR. For therapeutic rivaroxaban dosage, the CT(ExTEM) was significantly 
      reduced. The other parameters remained unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Thromboelastometry can detect rivaroxaban effects. In vitro rFVIIa seems highly 
      effective for reversal in contrast to PCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban is widely used for long-term prevention and maintenance 
      therapy of thromboembolic disorders. The existing oral dosage forms of 
      rivaroxaban lead to poor patient adherence because of repeated daily 
      administration. The aim of this study is to design long-acting rivaroxaban- 
      loaded microspheres to reduce dosing frequency and improve patient compliance. 
      METHODS: Rivaroxaban-loaded microspheres were prepared using the emulsion-solvent 
      evaporation method. The microspheres were evaluated in terms of morphology, 
      particle size, drug loading and encapsulation efficiency, the physical state of 
      the drug in the matrix, in vitro release/release mechanism, and in vivo 
      pharmacokinetics in Sprague Dawley rats. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: Rivaroxaban-loaded 
      microspheres presented spherical-shaped particles displaying a mean particle size 
      of 89.3 μm, drug loading of 16.5% and encapsulation efficiency of 97.8%. The 
      X-ray diffraction indicated that rivaroxaban existed in crystal form in the 
      microspheres. in vitro release lasting approximately 50 days was characterized as 
      a tri-phasic pattern: (1) an initial burst release, mainly due to the dissolution 
      of drug particles with direct access to the microparticles' surface, (2) a 
      "plateau" phase with a slow-release rate controlled by the diffusion and (3) a 
      final, rapid drug release phase controlled by polymer erosion. Pharmacokinetic 
      studies showed that rivaroxaban microspheres maintained a sustained release for 
      more than 42 days. CONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban-loaded microspheres have great 
      potential clinical advantages in reducing dosing frequency and improving patient 
      compliance. The data obtained from this study could be used as scientific 
      evidence for decision-making in future formulation development.

      and apixaban.
PG  - 140-5
LID - 10.1007/s00059-014-4188-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, 
      and apixaban show similar efficacy for stroke prevention in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) as the vitamin K antagonist warfarin. Absorption of NOACs is 
      dependent on the intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp) system and P-gp activity is 
      modulated by a variety of drugs and food components. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this 
      review is to give an overview of P-gp-associated drug-drug and drug-food 
      interactions with NOACs in AF patients. METHODS: A literature search was carried 
      out by screening MEDLINE for the terms dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      P-glycoprotein, and atrial fibrillation from 1998 to 2013. Randomized clinical 
      trials, longitudinal studies, case series, and case reports were included. 
      RESULTS: Concomitant medication with proton pump inhibitors, amiodarone, 
      clarithromycin, and verapamil increased bioavailability whereas rifampicin 
      decreased the bioavailability of dabigatran. Coadministration of erythromycin, 
      clarithromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, and ritonavir increased rivaroxaban 
      plasma concentrations. No data were found on apixaban and P-gp-modulating drugs 
      or on NOACs and food components modulating P-gp. The clinical relevance of 
      interactions between NOACs and P-gp-modulating drugs or food components is 
      largely unknown as bleeding complications under NOACs and P-gp-inhibiting drugs 
      are mainly reported from patients with concomitant renal failure. CONCLUSION: 
      There is an urgent need to investigate the role of P-gp-modulating substances as 
      potential sources of drug-drug and drug-food interactions. A thorough analysis of 
      the data accumulated in the three large NOAC trials regarding the role of 
      P-gp-modulating drugs in bleeding and embolic events is desirable. 
      Pharmacological studies should investigate the influence of P-gp-modulating drugs 
      and food on NOAC plasma concentrations and coagulation parameters. When 
      prescribing NOACs, patients should be informed about the potential interactions 
      with drugs and herbal drugs. Patients who develop bleeding or embolic events 
      under treatment with NOACs should be investigated for co-medications as well as 
      for over-the-counter drugs and dietary habits. In post-marketing surveillance of 
      NOACs, the association with drug or food intake with complications, bleeding, and 
      embolic events should be registered.

TI  - Rivaroxaban in the treatment of venous thromboembolism and the prevention of 
      recurrences: a practical approach.

AB  - Anticoagulation therapy is the standard treatment of patients with symptomatic 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary 
      embolism. Until recently, treatment of VTE was based on parenteral or 
      low-molecular-weight heparin for initial therapy (5-10 days) and oral vitamin K 
      antagonists for long-term therapy. Those treatments have some limitations, 
      including parenteral administration (heparins), the need for frequent monitoring 
      and dose adjustments, interactions with several medications, and dietary 
      restrictions (vitamin K antagonists). Rivaroxaban is a new oral direct factor Xa 
      inhibitor with a wide therapeutic window, predictable anticoagulant effect, no 
      food interactions, and few drug interactions. Consequently, no periodic 
      monitoring of anticoagulation is needed, and fixed doses can be prescribed. 
      EINSTEIN program demonstrated that rivaroxaban was as effective as and 
      significantly safer than standard therapy for treatment of VTE. Rivaroxaban was 
      recently authorized so doubts exist about how to use it in daily clinical 
      practice. This document aims to clarify common questions formulated by clinicians 
      regarding the use of this new drug.

      dosing regimens in different indications.
PG  - 1587-603

AB  - Target-specific oral anticoagulants have become increasingly available as 
      alternatives to traditional agents for the management of a number of 
      thromboembolic disorders. To date, the direct Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban is 
      the most widely approved of the new agents. The dosing of rivaroxaban varies and 
      adheres to specific schedules in each of the clinical settings in which it has 
      been investigated. These regimens were devised based on the results of phase II 
      dose-finding studies and/or pharmacokinetic modeling, and were demonstrated to be 
      successful in randomized, phase III studies. In most cases, the pharmacodynamic 
      profile of rivaroxaban permits once-daily dosing. A once-daily dose is indicated 
      for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing hip or 
      knee replacement surgery, the long-term prevention of stroke in patients with 
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation, and the long-term secondary prevention of 
      recurrent VTE. Twice-daily dosing is required in the acute phase of treatment in 
      patients with VTE and in the combination of rivaroxaban with standard single or 
      dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention after acute coronary syndrome 
      events. This article reviews the empirical and clinical rationale supporting the 
      dose regimens of rivaroxaban in each clinical setting.

PG  - 581-8
LID - 10.1097/FJC.0b013e31822f6c2b [doi]
AB  - Many patients with acute coronary syndrome receive chronic dual antiplatelet 
      therapy (acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel) for secondary event prophylaxis, 
      and new oral anticoagulants are being investigated as adjunctive therapy in this 
      indication. Gastrointestinal side effects such as bleeding are commonly 
      associated with antiplatelet use; accordingly, many patients receive proton pump 
      inhibitors (PPIs) to mitigate this. PPIs can reduce the antiplatelet activity of 
      clopidogrel through cytochrome P450 2C19 inhibition, and pantoprazole reduces the 
      bioavailability of dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor that acts via 
      cytochrome P450 2C19-independent mechanisms. These observations support the 
      investigation of potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions 
      between PPIs and anticoagulants. We evaluated the influence of administering 
      once-daily omeprazole 40 mg for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of a single 20-mg dose of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, 
      rivaroxaban, in a randomized, open-label, 2-way, crossover, drug-drug interaction 
      study in healthy subjects. No clinically meaningful interactions were observed; 
      geometric mean ratios were 101%, 101%, and 93.5% for rivaroxaban area under the 
      plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable 
      concentration (AUClast), or until infinity (AUC∞), and maximum plasma 
      concentration (Cmax), respectively. Prothrombin time increased similarly in both 
      treatment groups, with maximal values observed approximately 4 hours post 
      rivaroxaban administration. A single 20-mg rivaroxaban dose appears well 
      tolerated when administered alone or after 5 days of once-daily omeprazole 40 mg 
      administration.

TI  - Evidence-Based Development and Rationale for Once-Daily Rivaroxaban Dosing 
      Regimens Across Multiple Indications.
PG  - 412-22
LID - 10.1177/1076029616631427 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, has been developed to meet 
      clinical needs in a broad range of indications in adults: prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism after elective hip or knee replacement surgery, treatment and 
      secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism, prevention of stroke and systemic 
      embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation having one or more risk 
      factors, and in Europe, prevention of atherothrombotic events after an acute 
      coronary syndrome in patients with elevated cardiac biomarkers. However, the 
      precise dose and regimen vary with the indication, leading to this effort to 
      provide clarity concerning the appropriate use of rivaroxaban. This article 
      reviews the clinical development program for rivaroxaban and summarizes the 
      evidence for each approved, indication-specific dose regimen. RESULTS: Although 
      initially investigated for twice-daily dosing, early observations, including the 
      finding that the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban last longer than the 
      elimination half-life, suggested that once-daily dosing might be attainable and 
      effective. These observations were evaluated within the extensive phase II 
      program, which, together with pharmacology studies, provides the evidence 
      underpinning the selection of once-daily regimens for most, but not all, of the 
      approved clinical indications for rivaroxaban. CONCLUSION: The evidence for each 
      dosing regimen demonstrates that although pharmacology studies are of paramount 
      importance, dose regimens must be subjected to careful empirical validation. 
      Once-daily dosing was shown to be clinically appropriate for most rivaroxaban 
      indications. Furthermore, a "one size fits all" approach to dosing frequency is 
      unlikely to result in a regimen that yields optimal patient outcomes across 
      different indications.

      stroke and venous and arterial thromboembolism.
PG  - 501-514
LID - 10.1080/14779072.2018.1484281 [doi]
AB  - Until recently, vitamin K antagonists (VKA) were the only drugs available for 
      long-term anticoagulation. The use of these drugs is laborious due to their 
      variable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The advent of direct oral 
      anticoagulants has produced a paradigm shift due to their low incidence of drug 
      interactions, their stable plasma levels, and their lack of monitoring. 
      Rivaroxaban, a factor Xa inhibitor, has been tested in different clinical 
      scenarios and has proved to be effective and safe, even increasing the scope of 
      the old VKA. Areas covered: A non-systematic review of the literature was 
      conducted using the PubMed and Cochrane databases, focusing on randomized 
      clinical trials and real-world observational studies that evaluated rivaroxaban 
      in patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, and atherosclerotic 
      coronary and peripheral vascular disease. Expert commentary: The role of 
      rivaroxaban keeps expanding into areas that were unimaginable few years ago, in 
      the light of solid evidence that has eliminated old strict paradigms. 
      Nonetheless, it will be necessary to adjust costs and better understand the 
      perceived barriers to its widespread implementation, to get fully acceptation of 
      rivaroxaban for the different clinical conditions that have been suggested.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Edoxaban is an oral, once-daily direct factor Xa 
      inhibitor. To support the possibility that patients may choose to switch 
      treatment from another nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant to edoxaban, 
      this clinical study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic effects of edoxaban after switching from rivaroxaban or 
      dabigatran etexilate to edoxaban. METHODS: In this open-label, three-period, 
      crossover study, healthy subjects received 3 days of edoxaban 60 mg daily, 
      rivaroxaban 20 mg daily, or dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily, followed by 
      edoxaban 60 mg on day 4. RESULTS: Day 4 edoxaban pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      similar for all treatments. The peak effect of edoxaban on prothrombin time (PT) 
      after 4 days of edoxaban only was 21.8 ± 2.46 s; after switching from rivaroxaban 
      to edoxaban, peak effect on PT was similar at 21.8 ± 2.88 s. After switching from 
      dabigatran etexilate to edoxaban, least squares mean activated partial 
      thromboplastin time (aPTT) at 2 h after administration was 47.6 vs 35.0 s for 
      edoxaban alone. The treatment difference was 12.8 s (95% confidence interval 
      10.5-15.1; p < 0.0001). Post hoc analysis revealed that predose aPTT was elevated 
      on day 3 of dabigatran etexilate administration, and on day 4, indicating a 
      carryover effect from dabigatran. All treatments were well tolerated and there 
      were no safety concerns upon switching, with no increased risk of bleeding. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that switching to edoxaban from either 
      rivaroxaban or dabigatran etexilate at the time of the next dose is well 
      tolerated and maintains coagulation status.

AB  - A direct oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban fails to prevent stroke and systemic 
      embolism in one-to-several percent of patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF), but the reasons are unknown. The study used semi-mechanistic 
      in vitro-in vivo prediction (IVIVP) modeling to explore the reasons for 
      ineffective thrombosis prevention in NVAF patients. Steady-state drug 
      concentrations in plasma were measured at 0 h (C(trough)), 3 h (C(3h)), and 12 h 
      post-dosing in thirty-four patients treated with 20 mg rivaroxaban daily. The 
      clinical data were compared against "virtual twins" generated with a novel IVIVP 
      model that combined drug dissolution modeling, mechanistic description of gastric 
      drug transit, and population pharmacokinetics defining the variability of drug 
      disposition. The nonresponders had significantly lower C(3h) and C(trough) than 
      the responders (p < 0.001) and the covariates included in the population 
      pharmacokinetic submodel did not fully explain this difference. Simulations 
      involving varied gastrointestinal parameters in the "virtual twins" revealed that 
      lower small intestinal effective permeability (P(eff)), rather than a slower 
      stomach emptying rate, could explain low rivaroxaban exposure in the 
      nonresponders. IVIVP modeling was effectively used for exploring pharmacotherapy 
      failure. Low P(eff), found as a major determinant of ineffective rivaroxaban 
      treatment, encourages further research to find (pato)physiological factors 
      influencing suboptimal absorption.

TI  - Effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a 
      single dose of rivaroxaban, an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor.
PG  - 89-98
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12054 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study investigated the effects of hepatic impairment on the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of rivaroxaban (10 mg), an 
      oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor. METHOD: This single centre, non-randomized, 
      non-blinded study included subjects with mild (n = 8) or moderate hepatic 
      impairment (n = 8), according to the Child-Pugh classification, and 
      gender-matched healthy subjects (n = 16). RESULTS: Rivaroxaban was well tolerated 
      irrespective of hepatic function. Mild hepatic impairment did not significantly 
      affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban, compared with 
      healthy subjects. However, in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, total 
      body clearance was decreased, leading to a significant increase in the area under 
      the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). The least-squares (LS)-mean values for 
      AUC were 1.15-fold [90% confidence interval (CI) 0.85, 1.57] and 2.27-fold (90% 
      CI 1.68, 3.07) higher in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, 
      respectively, than in healthy subjects. Consequently, the pharmacodynamic 
      responses were significantly enhanced in subjects with moderate hepatic 
      impairment. For inhibition of Factor Xa, increases in the area under the 
      effect-time curve and the maximum effect were observed, with LS-mean ratios of 
      2.59 and 1.24, respectively, vs. healthy subjects. Prolongation of prothrombin 
      time was similar in healthy subjects and those with mild hepatic impairment, but 
      was significantly enhanced in those with moderate hepatic impairment. CONCLUSION: 
      Moderate (but not mild) hepatic impairment reduced total body clearance of 
      rivaroxaban after a single 10 mg dose, leading to increased rivaroxaban exposure 
      and pharmacodynamic effects.

TI  - Polypharmacy and the Efficacy and Safety of Rivaroxaban Versus Warfarin in the 
      Prevention of Stroke in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 352-60
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.018544 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) often take multiple 
      medications. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined characteristics and compared 
      adjusted outcomes between rivaroxaban and warfarin according to number of 
      concomitant baseline medications and the presence of combined cytochrome P450 3A4 
      and P-glycoprotein inhibitors in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa 
      Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and 
      Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF) study. At baseline, 5101 
      patients (36%) were on 0 to 4 medications, 7298 (51%) were on 5 to 9, and 1865 
      (13%) were on ≥ 10. Although polypharmacy was not associated with higher risk of 
      stroke or non-central nervous system embolism (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.02 for ≥ 
      10 versus 0-4 medications; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.38), it was associated 
      with higher risks of the combined end point of stroke, non-central nervous system 
      embolism, vascular death, or myocardial infarction (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.41 
      for ≥ 10 versus 0-4 medications; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.68) and nonmajor 
      clinically relevant or major bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.47 for ≥ 10 
      versus 0-4 medications; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-1.65). There was no 
      significant difference in primary efficacy (adjusted interaction P=0.99) or 
      safety outcomes (adjusted interaction P=0.87) between treatment groups by number 
      of medications. Patients treated with 0 to 4 medications had lower rates of major 
      bleeding with rivaroxaban (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 
      0.52-0.95; interaction P=0.0074). There was no evidence of differential outcomes 
      in those treated with ≥ 1 combined cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein 
      inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: In a population of patients with atrial fibrillation, 
      two thirds were on ≥ 5 medications. Increasing medication use was associated with 
      higher risk of bleeding but not stroke. Rivaroxaban was tolerated across complex 
      patients on multiple medications. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:

TI  - Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis of rivaroxaban in Chinese

AB  - Rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, is widely used for stroke prevention 
      in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The aim of this study 
      was to conduct a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) analysis of 
      rivaroxaban in Chinese patients with NVAF to assess ethnic differences and 
      provide model-based precision dosing. A total of 256 rivaroxaban plasma 
      concentrations and 244 prothrombin time (PT) measurements were obtained from 195 
      Chinese NVAF patients from a prospective clinical trial. The population PK-PD 
      model was developed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM) software. The 
      PK of rivaroxaban was adequately described using a one-compartment model with 
      first-order adsorption and elimination. Estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      (eGFR) was identified as a major covariate for apparent clearance. No single 
      nucleotide polymorphism was identified as a significant covariate. PT exhibited a 
      linear relationship with rivaroxaban concentration. Total bilirubin (TBIL) and 
      eGFR were identified as significant covariates for baseline PT. According to the 
      Monte Carlo simulation, 15 mg for Chinese patients with eGFR ≥50 mL/min and 
      normal liver function yielded an exposure comparable to 20 mg for Caucasian 
      patients. Patients with moderately impaired renal function may require a lower 
      dose of rivaroxaban to avoid overexposure. Moreover, there was an approximate 26% 
      increase in PT levels in patients with TBIL of 34 μmol/L and eGFR of 30 mL/min, 
      which could increase the risk of major bleeding. The established population PK-PD 
      model could inform individualized dosing for Chinese NVAF patients who are 
      administered rivaroxaban.

TI  - Rivaroxaban and macitentan can be coadministered without dose adjustment but the 
      combination of rivaroxaban and St John's wort should be avoided.
PG  - 2903-2913
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13757 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: We assessed the potential mutual interaction of oral macitentan (cytochrome 
      P450 (CYP) 3A4 substrate) at steady-state with single-dose oral rivaroxaban 
      (CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein substrate) and evaluated the effect of the CYP3A and 
      P-glycoprotein inducer St John's wort (SJW) on the pharmacokinetics of these 
      drugs in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers completed this 
      open-label, monocentre, two-period, one-sequence phase I clinical trial. The 
      pharmacokinetics of macitentan (10 mg) was assessed on study days 3 (single 
      dose), 15 (steady-state), 16 (impact of rivaroxaban) and 29 (after induction by 
      oral SJW), and of rivaroxaban on days 2 (single dose), 16 (impact of macitentan 
      at steady-state) and 29 (after induction by SJW). Concurrently, we quantified 
      changes of CYP3A activity using oral microdoses of midazolam (30 μg). RESULTS: 
      Rivaroxaban and macitentan did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of 
      each other. After induction with SJW, CYP3A activity increased by 272% and 
      geometric mean ratios of macitentan AUC decreased by 48% and of C(max) by 45%. 
      Concurrently, also geometric mean ratios of rivaroxaban AUC and C(max) decreased 
      by 25%. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence for a relevant pharmacokinetic 
      interaction between macitentan and rivaroxaban suggesting that these two drugs 
      can be combined without dose adjustment. SJW strongly increased CYP3A activity 
      and substantially reduced rivaroxaban and macitentan exposure while estimated net 
      endothelin antagonism only decreased by 20%, which is considered clinically 
      irrelevant. The combination of SJW with rivaroxaban should be avoided.

TI  - Real-World Rivaroxaban and Apixaban Levels in Asian Patients With Atrial 
      Fibrillation.
PG  - 278-286
LID - 10.1002/cpt.1601 [doi]
AB  - This study aims to measure the plasma levels of rivaroxaban and apixaban among 
      Asian patients with atrial fibrillation and compare the results with expected 
      drug levels from clinical studies. A total of 73 patients taking rivaroxaban and 
      105 patients taking apixaban were enrolled. Peak and trough levels were measured 
      using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. 
      The percentage of those with drug levels within the expected range reported in 
      clinical studies was significantly higher in the apixaban group than in the 
      rivaroxaban group, both for trough (84.8% vs. 64.4%; P = 0.002) and peak levels 
      (76.9% vs. 33.8%; P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, kidney function, 
      appropriate dose, and adherence, patients taking rivaroxaban were still less 
      likely to have peak and trough levels within the expected drug levels. Our 
      real-world data suggests that Asian patients taking rivaroxaban are more likely 
      to have out-of-expected drug levels than those taking apixaban.

TI  - Applications of Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling of 
      Rivaroxaban-Renal and Hepatic Impairment and Drug-Drug Interaction Potential.
PG  - 656-665
LID - 10.1002/jcph.1784 [doi]
AB  - The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban is used in several 
      thromboembolic disorders. Rivaroxaban is eliminated via both metabolic 
      degradation and renal elimination as unchanged drug. Therefore, renal and hepatic 
      impairment may reduce rivaroxaban clearance, and medications inhibiting these 
      clearance pathways could lead to drug-drug interactions. This physiologically 
      based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) study investigated the pharmacokinetic behavior of 
      rivaroxaban in clinical situations where drug clearance is impaired. A PBPK model 
      was developed using mass balance and bioavailability data from adults and 
      qualified using clinically observed data. Renal and hepatic impairment were 
      simulated by adjusting disease-specific parameters, and concomitant drug use was 
      simulated by varying enzyme activity in virtual populations (n = 1000) and 
      compared with pharmacokinetic predictions in virtual healthy populations and 
      clinical observations. Rivaroxaban doses of 10 mg or 20 mg were used. Mild to 
      moderate renal impairment had a minor effect on area under the concentration-time 
      curve and maximum plasma concentration of rivaroxaban, whereas severe renal 
      impairment caused a more pronounced increase in these parameters vs normal renal 
      function. Area under the concentration-time curve and maximum plasma 
      concentration increased with severity of hepatic impairment. These effects were 
      smaller in the simulations compared with clinical observations. AUC and C(max) 
      increased with the strength of cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors 
      in simulations and clinical observations. This PBPK model can be useful for 
      estimating the effects of impaired drug clearance on rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics. Identifying other factors that affect the pharmacokinetics of 
      rivaroxaban could facilitate the development of models that approximate 
      real-world pharmacokinetics more accurately.

TI  - Preclinical and clinical characteristics of rivaroxaban: a novel, oral, direct 
      factor Xa inhibitor.
PG  - 515-23
AB  - There are several novel anticoagulants in development that target factor 
      Xa(FXa)-the pivotal point of the coagulation cascade. One promising agent is 
      rivaroxaban (a highly selective, oral, direct FXa inhibitor), which is in 
      advanced clinical development for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic 
      disorders. Oral rivaroxaban may be given in fixed once-daily doses, with the 
      potential for no coagulation monitoring. These properties, along with results 
      from preclinical and clinical studies, suggest that rivaroxaban may have 
      advantages over current treatments. Studies in arterial and venous animal models 
      demonstrated that rivaroxaban has potent antithrombotic effects, without 
      prolonging bleeding times. In healthy subjects, rivaroxaban was well tolerated, 
      with a predictable pharmacological profile and a low propensity for clinically 
      relevant drug-drug interactions. Phase II studies of rivaroxaban for the 
      prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after major orthopedic surgery support 
      these findings. The results also suggested that a total daily dose range of 5 to 
      20 mg rivaroxaban had similar efficacy and safety to enoxaparin, and that 10 mg 
      rivaroxaban once daily was the optimal dose. This review assesses the preclinical 
      and clinical characteristics of rivaroxaban, and discusses phase II findings with 
      rivaroxaban for the prevention of VTE after major orthopedic surgery.

TI  - TAVR: nemesis of NOACs?
PG  - 181-184
LID - 10.1007/s11239-022-02721-6 [doi]
AB  - Data on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in transcatheter 
      aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients are controversial. In patients without 
      atrial fibrillation (AF), rivaroxaban showed enhanced ischemia and bleeding as 
      compared to standard of care. ENVISAGE showed enhanced bleeding in AF patients as 
      compared to vitamin K antagonist (VKA). Only apixaban was non-inferior but failed 
      superiority regarding bleeding in AF patients after TAVR. One could hypothesize 
      that this might be due to pharmacokinetics of NOACs. Therefore, we compared 
      outcome in rivaroxaban/edoxaban (once-daily) and apixaban (twice-daily) treated 
      patients. 568 patients with indication for permanent oral anticoagulation due to 
      AF undergoing TAVR were analyzed via inverse probability of treatment weighting. 
      Valve academic research consortium complications during 30-day follow-up were 
      assessed. Bleeding complications were similar in once-daily and twice-daily NOACs 
      (major: 22 (7.5%) vs. 14 (5.3%), p = 0.285; minor: 66 (22.4%) vs. 46 (17.4%), 
      p = 0.133). Complications did not change when splitting the cohort in the 
      different agents apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban. These findings remained 
      robust after multivariate analysis. In summary, twice-daily and once-daily NOACs 
      did not differ regarding bleeding complications in a hypothesis generating 
      real-world cohort of TAVR patients with AF.

TI  - Rivaroxaban: a novel oral anticoagulant for the prevention and treatment of 
      several thrombosis-mediated conditions.
PG  - 42-55
LID - 10.1111/nyas.12136 [doi]
AB  - The development of rivaroxaban (XARELTO®) is an important new medical advance in 
      the field of oral anticoagulation. Thrombosis-mediated conditions constitute a 
      major burden for patients, healthcare systems, and society. For more than 60 
      years, the prevention and treatment of these conditions have been dominated by 
      oral vitamin K antagonists (such as warfarin) and the injectable heparins. 
      Thrombosis can lead to several conditions, including deep vein thrombosis, 
      pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, and/or death. Prevention and 
      treatment of thrombosis with an effective, convenient-to-use oral anticoagulant 
      with a favorable safety profile is critical, especially in an aging society in 
      which the risk of thrombosis, and the potential for bleeding complications, is 
      increasing. Rivaroxaban acts to prevent and treat thrombosis by potently 
      inhibiting coagulation Factor Xa in the blood. Factor Xa converts prothrombin to 
      thrombin, which initiates the formation of blood clots by converting fibrinogen 
      to clot-forming fibrin and leads to platelet activation. After a large and novel 
      clinical development program in over 75,000 patients to date, rivaroxaban has 
      received approval for multiple indications in the United States, European Union, 
      and other countries worldwide to prevent and treat several thrombosis-mediated 
      conditions. This review will highlight some of the unique aspects of the 
      rivaroxaban development program.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Novel biomarkers for personalizing anticoagulation remain 
      undetermined. We aimed to investigate the association of plasma miRNAs with 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) profiles of rivaroxaban. METHODS: This is 
      a multicenter, exploratory study of miRNAs in a Chinese population. Healthy 
      volunteers and patients receiving rivaroxaban were enrolled in the study. The 
      area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0-t h (AUC(0-t)) and 
      anti-Xa activity at 3 h (AXA(3h)) were measured in healthy volunteers, and 
      AXA(3h) was measured in patients. MiRNAs were detected by miRNA microarray in 26 
      healthy volunteers with 20 mg rivaroxaban, and quantitative reverse transcription 
      polymerase chain reaction was used to exclude undetectable ones. MiR-320a-3p and 
      miR-483-5p were then quantified in 65 healthy volunteers and 71 patients. MiRNA 
      levels at 3 h were compared between high and low AXA(3h) or AUC(0-t) subjects and 
      in matched patients with or without bleeding during follow-up. The miRNA targets 
      were predicted by TargetScan, miRTarBase, and miRDB. Validated genes were 
      included in GO enrichment and KEGG analyses. The protein-protein interaction 
      network was established by STRING and visualized by Cytoscape. RESULTS: A total 
      of 136 Chinese subjects completed the study. In healthy volunteers taking 15 mg 
      rivaroxaban, the miR-320a level at 3 h was significantly positively correlated 
      with AXA(3h) and AUC(0-t) (r = 0.359, p = 0.025; r = 0.370, p = 0.02, 
      respectively). A positive correlation was also observed between miR-483 and 
      AXA(3h) or AUC(0-t) (r = 0.372, p = 0.02; r = 0.523, p = 0.001, respectively). 
      MiR-320a and miR-483 levels at 3 h in the higher AUC(0-t) group were 
      significantly higher than those at 0 h. MiR-483 levels at 3 h may distinguish 
      healthy volunteers with high or low AXA(3h) or AUC(0-t). In the 10 mg fed 
      subgroup, higher 3 h mir-483 levels were also observed compared with the control 
      group. No significant differences were found in the comparisons among patients. 
      Bioinformatic analysis showed that these miRNAs may play a regulatory role by 
      targeting ABCG2, ITGB3, PTEN, MAPK1/3, etc. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-320a and miR-483 
      levels were found to be associated with PK and PD profiles of rivaroxaban in 
      healthy Chinese subjects. Further studies are required to verify these findings 
      and explore the mechanisms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate a high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination 
      of rivaroxaban and evaluate the correlation between plasma concentration and 
      anti-Xa activity in patients using oral rivaroxaban. METHODS: In this study, the 
      plasma concentration of rivaroxaban and anti-Xa factor activities was determined 
      in 125 patients, and the relationship between the two variables was analysed by 
      SPSS 21.0 software. RESULTS: The results showed that the plasma concentrations of 
      oral rivaroxaban patients were significantly correlated with the activity of the 
      anti-Xa factor (Spearman's r = 0.990, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The plasma 
      concentrations of rivaroxaban are a potentially useful monitoring indicator to 
      assess the patient's bleeding risk if testing for plasma anti-Xa activity is not 
      available.

TI  - Rivaroxaban in the Prevention of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients with 
      Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation: Clinical Implications of the ROCKET AF Trial 
      and Its Subanalyses.
PG  - 395-401
LID - 10.1007/s40256-015-0127-2 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly common cause of stroke and systemic 
      embolism. While warfarin has been the mainstay of stroke prevention in patients 
      with AF, newer novel oral anticoagulant medications are now available. 
      Rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor with a rapid onset and offset after 
      oral administration, offers potential advantages over warfarin, predominantly due 
      to its predictable pharmacokinetics across wide patient populations. It requires 
      no coagulation monitoring, and only two different doses are needed (20 mg daily 
      for patients with normal renal function and 15 mg daily in those with reduced 
      renal function). A large randomized trial (ROCKET AF) has shown non-inferiority 
      to warfarin for preventing stroke or systemic embolism in the per-protocol 
      population and superiority to warfarin in the on-treatment safety population. 
      Several subanalyses confirm that the treatment effect of rivaroxaban is 
      consistent across different patient subgroups, including those with reduced renal 
      function. The tolerability of rivaroxaban appears similar to that of warfarin, 
      with comparable overall bleeding rates in clinical trials. In ROCKET AF, 
      significantly lower rates of fatal and intracranial bleeding were seen with 
      rivaroxaban, while lower rates of gastrointestinal bleeding were seen with 
      warfarin. Important contraindications to rivaroxaban include valvular AF, the 
      presence of a prosthetic valve (mechanical or bioprosthetic) or valve repair, the 
      need for concurrent dual antiplatelet therapy, and creatinine clearance 
      <30 ml/min. Once-daily dosing and the lack of coagulation monitoring may increase 
      utilization and adherence compared with warfarin, potentially decreasing the 
      large burden of care associated with stroke secondary to AF. Overall, rivaroxaban 
      offers a useful alternative to warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with 
      AF.

TI  - Rivaroxaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients.
PG  - 733-741
LID - 10.1080/14779072.2020.1823218 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anticoagulant therapy is in use for both prevention and treatment 
      of venous and arterial thromboembolic disorders. Delivering safe and effective 
      anticoagulation in the pediatric population is challenging, since the available 
      standard therapy with parenteral UFH and LMWH is troublesome for most pediatric 
      patients, and VKAs require frequent INR monitoring due to the unpredictable 
      pharmacokinetics and numerous food and drug interactions. Rivaroxaban, a direct 
      FXa inhibitor, offers the convenience of oral administration and predictable 
      pharmacokinetics across a wide range of patients. Its safety and efficacy have 
      been previously established in various adult indications. AREAS COVERED: This 
      review outlines pharmacologic and clinical aspects regarding rivaroxaban 
      treatment in adults and children, and provides a broad appraisal of the The 
      EINSTEIN-Jr program which evaluated the safety and efficacy of body-weight 
      adjusted pediatric rivaroxaban regimens for the treatment of VTE in children. A 
      review of the literature using the keywords rivaroxaban and pediatric venous 
      thromboembolism was conducted within the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) 
      and EMBASE databases. EXPERT OPINION: Rivaroxaban represents an appealing 
      therapeutic alternative for VTE in children. Further research should explore 
      additional indications for rivaroxaban in the pediatric population beyond that of 
      VTE.

      acetonitrile and 0.1 % formic acid in water at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The 
      detection was performed on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer by 
      multiple reaction monitoring mode to monitor the precursor-to-product ion 
      transitions of m/z 436.1 → 145.1 for rivaroxaban, m/z 460.0 → 443.1 for apixaban, 
      m/z 548.2 → 366.1 for edoxaban and m/z 285.2 → 193.1 for diazepam (IS) using a 
      positive electrospray ionization interface. The method was validated over a 
      concentration range of 1.0-200 ng/mL for rivaroxaban, 1.0-100 ng/mL for apixaban 
      and 1.0-500 ng/mL for edoxaban. Total time for each chromatograph was 3.5 min. 
      The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy of the quality control samples at 
      low, medium, and high concentration levels exhibited relative standard deviations 
      <10.5 % and the accuracy values ranged from -9.9 to 11.3 %. The method was 
      successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban in rats.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There have been no animal experiments and clinical 
      studies on the pharmacokinetic interaction between rivaroxaban and enalapril. To 
      investigate whether a potential pharmacokinetic interaction is present between 
      rivaroxaban and enalapril, a rapid and sensitive Ultra performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and 
      validated to determine the concentration of rivaroxaban and enalapril in rat 
      plasma and was then applied to a pharmacokinetic interaction study. METHODS: The 
      analytes were separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 chromatography column 
      (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) with acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase 
      with gradient elution. The mass spectrometer was operated in multiple reaction 
      monitoring mode to monitor the precursor-to-product ion transitions of 
      436.1 → 145.1 m/z for rivaroxaban, 377.3 → 234.2 m/z for enalapril and 
      285.2 → 193.1 m/z for diazepam (IS). RESULTS: The method was validated over the 
      concentration range of 1.0-200 ng/mL for rivaroxaban and 0.5-100 ng/mL for 
      enalapril. The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy of the quality control 
      (QC) samples exhibited relative standard deviations (RSD) < 9.4% and the accuracy 
      values ranged from - 8.3 to 9.6%. After co-administration of rivaroxaban and 
      enalapril, the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the systemic 
      drug concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC(0-∞)) of rivaroxaban 
      were significantly increased by 19.6% (p < 0.05) and 21.3% (p < 0.05), 
      respectively. On the contrary, the plasma clearance rate (CL/F) of rivaroxaban 
      and enalapril was significantly decreased by 17.8% (p < 0.05) and 23.8% 
      (p < 0.05), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The UPLC-MS/MS method was successfully 
      applied to simultaneous determination of rivaroxaban and enalapril in rat plasma 
      and applied to study the pharmacokinetic interaction between rivaroxaban and 
      enalapril. The co-administration of rivaroxaban and enalapril resulted in a 
      significant drug interaction in rats.

AB  - Warfarin has been the mainstay oral anticoagulant (OAC) medication prescribed for 
      stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. However, warfarin therapy 
      is challenging because of marked interindividual variability in dose and 
      response, requiring frequent monitoring and dose titration. These limitations 
      have prompted the clinical development of new OACs (NOACs) that directly target 
      the coagulation cascade with rapid onset/offset of action, lower risk for 
      drug-drug interactions, and more predictable response. Recently, NOACs dabigatran 
      (direct thrombin inhibitor), and rivaroxaban and apixaban (factor Xa [FXa] 
      inhibitors) have gained regulatory approval as alternative therapies to warfarin. 
      Though the anticoagulation efficacy of these NOACs has been characterized, 
      differences in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles have become a 
      significant consideration in terms of drug selection and dosing. In this review, 
      we outline key pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features of each compound and 
      provide guidance on selection and dosing of the 3 NOACs relative to warfarin when 
      considering OAC therapy for AF patients. Importantly, we show that by better 
      understanding the effect of clinical variables such as age, renal function, 
      dosing interval, and drug metabolism (CYP3A4) and transport (P-glycoprotein), we 
      might be able to better predict the risk for sub- and supratherapeutic 
      anticoagulation response and individualize OAC selection and dosing.

AB  - For the past five decades, there has been little progress in the development of 
      oral anticoagulants, with the choices being limited to the vitamin K antagonists 
      (VKAs). The situation is changing with the development of orally active small 
      molecules that directly target thrombin or activated factor X (FXa). The two 
      agents in the most advanced stages of development are dabigatran etexilate and 
      rivaroxaban, which inhibit thrombin and FXa, respectively. Both are approved in 
      the EU and Canada for venous thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing elective 
      hip- or knee-replacement surgery. Other agents in the early stages of development 
      include several FXa inhibitors (apixaban, DU 176b, LY 517717, YM 150, betrixaban, 
      eribaxaban [PD 0348292] and TAK 442) and one thrombin inhibitor (AZD 0837). With 
      a predictable anticoagulant response and low potential for drug-drug 
      interactions, these new agents can be given in fixed doses without coagulation 
      monitoring. This renders them more convenient than VKAs. While the anticoagulant 
      effect of the new thrombin and FXa inhibitors is similar, differences in the 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters may influence their use in 
      clinical practice. Here, we compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      features of these new oral agents.

AB  - Therapeutic oral anticoagulation is still commonly achieved by administration of 
      warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists that are associated with an untoward 
      pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile leading to a high incidence of 
      bleeding complications or therapeutic failure. Hence, there is an unmet medical 
      need of novel easy-to-use oral anticoagulants with improved efficacy and safety. 
      Recent developments include the identification of non-peptidic small-molecules 
      that selectively inhibit certain serine proteases within the coagulation cascade. 
      Of these, the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban 
      have recently been licensed for thromboprophylaxis after orthopaedic surgery 
      mainly in Europe. In addition, the factor Xa inhibitor apixaban is in late-stage 
      clinical development. Each drug is prescribed at fixed doses without the need of 
      anticoagulant monitoring. Phase III trials in orthopaedic patients essentially 
      resulted in non-inferior efficacy of dabigatran and superior efficacy of 
      rivaroxaban over enoxaparin without any marked differences of drug safety, while 
      apixaban data is still controversial. However, alterations of rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban pharmacokinetics upon interactions with inhibitors and inducers of 
      CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein may complicate the use of these compounds in daily 
      practice, whereas dabigatran elimination largely depends on renal function. 
      Hence, this review reports PK/PD, efficacy and safety data of dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban throughout preclinical and clinical development.

AB  - Altering doses and regimens of a drug has consequences for the drug's 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. Based on a half-life of 5-13 h, it

      is used as a twice-daily regimen for the initial treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) and secondary prevention after acute coronary syndromes, 
      the approved dosing is once-daily for prevention of VTE after orthopaedic 
      surgery, long-term secondary prevention of VTE and stroke prevention in patients 
      with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Rivaroxaban dosing was based on the 
      evaluation of the efficacy and safety of several rivaroxaban doses and regimens 
      in phase II trials. A clear overall advantage of twice-daily dosing compared with 
      once-daily dosing was not documented for indications for which once-daily dosing 
      was subsequently selected. Once-daily dosing was therefore selected for these 
      indications because it is expected to be associated with better compliance than 
      twice-daily dosing, and potentially, with improved outcomes. These studies and 
      data obtained with another Factor Xa inhibitor, edoxaban, in addition to previous 
      experience with low molecular weight heparins, indicate that the clinical impact 
      of once-daily versus twice-daily doses on outcome in terms of efficacy and safety 
      cannot be reliably predicted from pharmacology data, e.g. elimination half-life, 
      obtained during pre-clinical and early phase I clinical studies but rather should 
      be ascertained empirically in phase II and III clinical trials.

TI  - Development and verification of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of 
      dronedarone and its active metabolite N-desbutyldronedarone: Application to 
      prospective simulation of complex drug-drug interaction with rivaroxaban.
PG  - 1873-1890
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15670 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Despite potential enzyme- and transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions 
      (DDIs) between dronedarone and rivaroxaban in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data remain limited to guide clinical practice. 
      We aimed to develop, verify and validate a physiologically based pharmacokinetic 
      (PBPK) model of dronedarone and its major metabolite, N-desbutyldronedarone 
      (NDBD), to prospectively interrogate this clinically relevant DDI in healthy and 
      mild renal impairment populations. METHODS: The middle-out development of our 
      PBPK model combined literature-derived or in-house in vitro data, predicted in 
      silico data and in vivo clinical data. Model verification was performed for 
      intravenous and oral (single and multiple) dosing regimens. Model validation for 
      the accurate prediction of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4- and P-glycoprotein-mediated 
      DDI utilized simvastatin and digoxin as respective victim drugs. 
      Rivaroxaban-specific inhibitory parameters of dronedarone and/or NDBD against 
      CYP3A4, CYP2J2, OAT3 and P-glycoprotein were incorporated into the PBPK-DDI model 
      for prospective dronedarone-rivaroxaban DDI simulation. RESULTS: Dronedarone and 
      NDBD PK following clinically relevant doses of 400 mg dronedarone across single 
      and multiple oral dosing were accurately simulated by incorporating effect of 
      auto-inactivation on dose nonlinearities. Following successful model validation, 
      nondose-adjusted rivaroxaban-dronedarone DDI in healthy and mild renal impairment 
      populations revealed simulated rivaroxaban area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve up to 24 h fold change greater than dose exposure 
      equivalence (0.70-1.43) at 1.65 and 1.84, respectively. Correspondingly, 
      respective major bleeding risk was 4.24 and 4.70% compared with threshold of 4.5% 
      representing contraindicated rivaroxaban-ketoconazole DDI. CONCLUSION: Our 
      PBPK-DDI model predicted clinically significant dronedarone-rivaroxaban DDI in 
      both healthy and mild renal impairment subjects. Greater benefit vs. risk could 
      be achieved with rivaroxaban dose reductions to at least 15 mg in mild renal 
      impairment subjects on concomitant dronedarone and rivaroxaban.

TI  - [Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the new oral anticoagulants dabigatran 
      and rivaroxaban].
PG  - 125-33
AB  - Dabigatran is the first available oral direct thrombin inhibitor anticoagulant. 
      Absorption of the prodrug, dabigatran etexilate and its conversion to dabigatran 
      is rapid (peak plasma concentrations are reached 4-6 hours following surgery, and 
      a further 2 hours later). Its oral bioavailability is low, but shows reduced 
      interindividual variability. Dabigatran specifically and reversibly inhibits 
      thrombin, the key enzyme in the coagulation cascade. Studies both in healthy 
      volunteers and in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery show a 
      predictable pk/pd profile that allows for fixed-dose regimens. The anticoagulant 
      effect correlates adequately with the plasma concentrations of the drug, 
      demonstrating effective anticoagulation combined with a low risk of bleeding. 
      Dabigatran is mainly eliminated by renal excretion (a fact which affects the 
      dosage in elderly and in moderate-severe renal failure patients), and no hepatic 
      metabolism by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes has been observed, showing a good 
      interaction profile. Rivaroxaban will probably be the first available oral factor 
      Xa (FXa) direct inhibitor anticoagulant drug. It produces a reversible and 
      predictable inhibition of FXa activity with potential to inhibit clot-bound FXa. 
      Its pharmacokinetic characteristics include rapid absorption, high oral 
      availability, high plasma protein binding and a half-life of aprox. 8 hours. 
      Rivaroxaban elimination is mainly renal, but also through faecal matter and by 
      hepatic metabolism. Although the drug has demonstrated moderate potential to 
      interact with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, it does not inhibit or induce any major 
      CYP450 enzyme.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Clinical benefit-risk balance of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) 
      in atherothrombosis prevention differs between anti-Xa and anti-IIa drugs and 
      their specific effect on platelet functions remains controversial. We hence 
      investigated rivaroxaban and dabigatran effect on platelets in identical 
      experimental conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood of fifteen healthy 
      volunteers was spiked with DOAC which plasma concentrations were measured by 
      specific anti-Xa or anti-IIa assays. Light transmission aggregometry measured in 
      platelet-rich plasma used low doses of agonists: 0.5 mM arachidonic acid, 2.5 μM 
      ADP, 0.5 μM epinephrine, 0.8 μg/ml collagen, 7.5 μM TRAP-6 and 0.5 pM tissue 
      factor in the presence of H-Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro-OH to prevent fibrin polymerization. 
      Platelet adhesion on collagen fibres was evaluated in whole blood under flow. 
      Same experiments were reproduced in the presence of aspirin. RESULTS: Median [95% 
      CI] plasma concentrations were of 28 [23-36], 128 [119-144] and 321 [293-361] 
      ng/ml for rivaroxaban and 39 [34-45], 171 [166-193] and 353 [349-382] ng/ml for 
      dabigatran. DOAC did not modify platelet aggregation or adhesion on collagen 
      fibres at any tested concentrations. However, they delayed platelet aggregation 
      secondary to coagulation activation with a more potent effect with dabigatran 
      (p < 0.001). Aspirin did not modify DOAC effect. CONCLUSION: Efficacy of 
      combining DOAC and aspirin in atherothrombosis prevention would not stem from a 
      direct antiplatelet effect of the formers but to their additive inhibitory effect 
      on platelet aggregation secondary to coagulation activation. This effect differs 
      according to DOAC molecules and may also result from the pleiotropic roles of the 
      different coagulation factors targeted by DOAC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The influence of genetic factors on the pharmacokinetics and clinical 
      outcomes of rivaroxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) 
      is poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the effects of CYP3A4/5, ABCB1, 
      and ABCG2 gene polymorphisms on the trough concentrations and the bleeding risk 
      of rivaroxaban in NVAF patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study is a 
      prospective multicenter study. The patient's blood samples were collected to 
      detect the steady-state trough concentrations of rivaroxaban and gene 
      polymorphisms. We visited the patients regularly at month 1, 3, 6, and 12 to 
      record bleeding events and medications. RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were 
      enrolled in this study, and 9 gene loci were detected. For the dose-adjusted 
      trough concentration ratio (C(trough)/D) of rivaroxaban, the homozygous mutant 
      type was significantly lower than wild type at ABCB1 rs4148738 locus (TT vs. CC, 
      P = 0.033), and the mutant type was significantly lower than the wild type at 
      ABCB1 rs4728709 locus (AA + GA vs. GG, P = 0.008). ABCB1 (rs1045642, rs1128503), 
      CYP3A4 (rs2242480, rs4646437), CYP3A5 (rs776746), and ABCG2 (rs2231137, 
      rs2231142) gene polymorphisms had no significant effect on the C(trough)/D of 
      rivaroxaban. For the bleeding events, we found that there were no significant 
      differences among genotypes of all gene loci. CONCLUSION: This study found for 
      the first time that ABCB1 rs4148738 and rs4728709 gene polymorphisms had a 
      significant impact on the C(trough)/D of rivaroxaban in NVAF patients. CYP3A4/5, 
      ABCB1, and ABCG2 gene polymorphisms were not associated with the bleeding risk of 
      rivaroxaban.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetic analysis of rivaroxaban in children and comparison to 
      prospective physiologically-based pharmacokinetic predictions.

AB  - Rivaroxaban has been investigated in the EINSTEIN-Jr program for the treatment of 
      acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children aged 0 to 18 years and in the 
      UNIVERSE program for thromboprophylaxis in children aged 2 to 8 years with 
      congenital heart disease after Fontan-procedure. Physiologically-based 
      pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modeling were used 
      throughout the pediatric development of rivaroxaban according to the 
      learn-and-confirm paradigm. The development strategy was to match pediatric drug 
      exposures to adult exposure proven to be safe and efficacious. In this analysis, 
      a refined pediatric PopPK model for rivaroxaban based on integrated EINSTEIN-Jr 
      data and interim PK data from part A of the UNIVERSE phase III study was 
      developed and the influence of potential covariates and intrinsic factors on 
      rivaroxaban exposure was assessed. The model adequately described the observed 
      pediatric PK data. PK parameters and exposure metrics estimated by the PopPK 
      model were compared to the predictions from a previously published pediatric PBPK 
      model for rivaroxaban. Ninety-one percent of the individual post hoc clearance 
      estimates were found within the 5th to 95th percentile of the PBPK model 
      predictions. In patients below 2 years of age, however, clearance was 
      underpredicted by the PBPK model. The iterative and integrative use of PBPK and 
      PopPK modeling and simulation played a major role in the establishment of the 
      bodyweight-adjusted rivaroxaban dosing regimen that was ultimately confirmed to 
      be a safe and efficacious dosing regimen for children aged 0 to 18 years with 
      acute VTE in the EINSTEIN-Jr phase III study.

TI  - Bioequivalence and Food Effect Assessment of 2 Rivaroxaban Formulations in 
      Healthy Chinese Volunteers: An Open, Randomized, Single-Dose, and 4-Period 
      Crossover Study.
PG  - 358-363
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.1031 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor used for the management of 
      thromboembolic disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, 
      pharmacokinetic profile, and bioequivalence of a generic and a branded 
      rivaroxaban formulation (Xarelto) under fasted and fed conditions in healthy 
      Chinese volunteers. An open-label, randomized, single-dose, 4-period complete, 
      and replicate crossover study in healthy Chinese volunteers was performed. A 
      single oral dose of 20 mg of 2 rivaroxaban formulations was administered to 72 
      healthy volunteers, with 36 in the fasted group and 36 consuming a high-fat diet. 
      The evaluated pharmacokinetic parameters, including maximum rivaroxaban 
      concentration, the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to 
      the last measurable concentration, and AUC from time 0 to infinity, were assessed 
      for BE. The plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban were measured by a validated 
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. The geometric mean ratios 
      with 90% confidence intervals of the maximum rivaroxaban concentration, AUC from 
      time 0 to the last measurable concentration, and AUC from time 0 to infinity were 
      all within the range of 80% to 125% under fasted and fed conditions. The 
      within-subject variability of the test and reference products was compared, and 
      the upper limit of the 90% confidence intervals for the test-to-reference ratio 
      of the within-subject variability was <2.5, which indicated that the rivaroxaban 
      test and the rivaroxaban reference formulation were bioequivalent. No serious 
      adverse events were reported during either fasted or fed conditions of the study.

TI  - Venous Thromboembolism in Children: The Rivaroxaban Experience.
PG  - 866-872
LID - 10.1055/s-0043-1778106 [doi]
AB  - The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the pediatric population has 
      increased more than 10-fold in the last 20 years, as a consequence of the 
      advancement of resuscitation and surgical techniques and the global increase in 
      life expectancy of children suffering from chronic pathologies. Monitoring 
      anticoagulant therapy to achieve outcomes within the target range in childhood 
      VTE, parenteral administration of medications, and frequent blood tests in 
      children are often cumbersome. Availability of safe and effective oral agents 
      with pediatric data to support use would be of clear benefit. A physiologically 
      based pharmacokinetic model was developed to estimate the appropriate dosing 
      schedule for rivaroxaban in children. This incorporated growth/maturation and 
      variability in anthropometrics (e.g., body height, weight, and body mass index), 
      anatomy (e.g., organ weight), physiology (e.g., blood flow rates), metabolism and 
      excretion. Rivaroxaban use in pediatric population underwent a complete 
      investigational program, consisting mainly of one phase I 
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics trial, three phase II trials, one phase III 
      trial. The phase III trial enrolled 500 patients from birth to <18 years and 
      documented the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban regimens at dose equivalent to 
      the adult 20 mg dose for the prevention of fatal or symptomatic nonfatal 
      recurrent VTE and major bleeding versus heparin or vitamin K antagonists. Results 
      were similar to those in rivaroxaban studies in adults. The efficacy and safety 
      of rivaroxaban in children reported in the EINSTEIN JUNIOR trial provide further 
      support to previous trials in adults (EINSTEIN Program), which demonstrate a 
      favorable profile for the use of rivaroxaban for the management of VTE in 
      challenging patient populations. Other clinical evidence contributing to the use 
      of rivaroxaban among different risk groups in pediatric VTE population confirms 
      the consistency with principal trial. Our review aims to describe the rationale 
      for using rivaroxaban oral suspension in clinical practice and to summarize its 
      multiple indications in each vascular bed (e.g., cerebral venous thrombosis, 
      symptomatic or asymptomatic central venous catheter-associated thrombosis), 
      etiology, and patients setting.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rivaroxaban does not require monitoring nor frequent dose 
      adjustment. However, searching for the optimal dose in the individual patient may 
      be useful in some situations. AIM: To determine which coagulation assay could be 
      used to assess the impact of rivaroxaban on haemostasis and provide guidelines 
      for the interpretation of routine lab tests. MATERIALS: Rivaroxaban was spiked at 
      concentrations ranging from 11 to 1,090 ng/mL in plateletpoor plasma. A large 
      panel of coagulation assays was tested. RESULTS: A concentration dependent 
      prolongation of aPTT, PT, dPT, PiCT was observed. PT and dPT were the most 
      sensitive chronometric assays but results varied depending on the reagent 
      (Triniclot PT Excel S>Recombiplastin 2G>Neoplastin R>Neoplastin CI+>Triniclot PT 
      Excel>Triniclot PT HTF>Innovin). FXa chromogenic assays showed the highest 
      sensitivity. In TGA, Cmax was the most sensitive parameter with the tissue factor 
      induced pathway. Rivaroxaban interferes on haemostasis diagnostic tests such the 
      measurement of clotting factors, fibrinogen, antithrombin, proteins C and S, 
      activated protein-C resistance and Xa-based chomogenic assays. CONCLUSIONS: PT 
      may be used as screening test to assess the risk of bleedings. A more specific 
      and sensitive assay such as Biophen DiXaI using calibrators should be used to 
      confirm the concentration of rivaroxaban. We also propose cut-off associated with 
      a bleeding or thrombosis risk based on pharmacokinetic studies. Standardization 
      of the time between the last intake of rivaroxaban and the sampling is mandatory.

TI  - Interindividual variability in dabigatran and rivaroxaban exposure: contribution 
      of ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms and interaction with clarithromycin.
PG  - 273-283
LID - 10.1111/jth.13577 [doi]
AB  - Essentials Rivaroxaban and dabigatran are substrates of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
      encoded by the ABCB1 gene. We tested the effect of ABCB1 polymorphisms and of a 
      P-gp inhibitor on both drugs' pharmacokinetics. The ABCB1 genotype was not a 
      clinically relevant determinant of both drugs' pharmacokinetics. Administration 
      of P-gp inhibitors with dabigatran or rivaroxaban should be exercised with 
      caution. SUMMARY: Background The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) dabigatran 
      and rivaroxaban are both substrates of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter, 
      encoded by the ABCB1 gene. Rivaroxaban is metabolized by cytochrome P450 A4 
      (CYP3A4). Interindividual variability in DOAC exposure and frequent 
      P-gp-associated drug-drug interactions have been described in patients. Objective 
      To assess the influence of ABCB1 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of 
      dabigatran and rivaroxaban, associated or not with clarithromycin, a P-gp and 
      CYP3A4 inhibitor. Methods Sixty healthy male volunteers, selected according to 
      ABCB1 genotype (20 homozygous mutated, 20 heterozygous mutated, and 20 wild-type 
      for haplotype 2677-3435), were included in this randomized, two-center, crossover 
      study. All received sequentially a single dose of dabigatran etexilate (300 mg) 
      and rivaroxaban (40 mg) associated or not with clarithromycin. Peak plasma 
      concentration and area under the curve (AUC) were compared across the three ABCB1 
      genotypes. The effect of clarithromycin on dabigatran or rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics was assessed. Results Interindividual coefficients of variation 
      for AUC were 77% for dabigatran and 51% for rivaroxaban. ABCB1 genotype did not 
      significantly affect drug pharmacokinetics: AUC ratios between mutant-allele 
      carriers and wild-type volunteers were 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
      0.84-1.92) and 1.20 (95% CI 0.96-1.51) for dabigatran and rivaroxaban, 
      respectively. Clarithromycin coadministration led to a two-fold increase in both 
      drugs' AUC, irrespective of ABCB1 genotype: ratios of geometric means were 2.0 
      (95% CI 1.15-3.60) and 1.94 (95% CI 1.42-2.63) for dabigatran and rivaroxaban, 
      respectively. Conclusions ABCB1 genotype is not a significant determinant of 
      interindividual variability in dabigatran and rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics. The 
      levels of one drug did not predict the levels of the other. Coadministration of a 
      P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitor with dabigatran or rivaroxaban may warrant caution in 
      patients at risk of overexposure.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban 
      (RVX), in healthy cats and to evaluate the clinicopathologic effects of various 
      plasma RVX concentrations within target therapeutic ranges established for 
      people. DESIGN: Prospective randomized cross-over study performed between July 
      2013 and November 2014. SETTING: Veterinary university teaching hospital. 
      ANIMALS: Six healthy adult domestic shorthair cats (3 males, 3 females). 
      INTERVENTIONS: Cats were treated with oral RVX at single, fixed doses (1.25, 2.5, 
      5 mg PO), q 12 h for 3 days (1.25 mg); q 24 h for 7 days (2.5 mg); and q 24 h for 
      28 days (1.25 mg). Blood samples were collected for complete blood count, blood 
      chemistry, and RVX anticoagulant activity based on prolongation of dilute 
      prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), activated Factor 
      X (FXa) inhibition (anti-Xa activity [aXa]) and high-pressure liquid 
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometry determination of drug concentration. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Treated cats had no signs of hemorrhage or 
      clinicopathologic off-target adverse effects. There were dose-dependent 
      prolongations of coagulation times and increase in aXa, with peak effect at 3 
      hours postadministration. There was a direct correlation between plasma RVX 
      concentration and dilute prothrombin time and aXa. Coagulation parameters 
      returned to baseline by 24 hours after the last dose. CONCLUSIONS: Oral RVX was 
      well tolerated by healthy cats with predictable pharmacokinetics and 
      anticoagulant effects. Clinical studies of RVX are warranted in cats with heart 
      disease.

TI  - CYP3A Activity and Rivaroxaban Serum Concentrations in Russian Patients with Deep 
      Vein Thrombosis.
PG  - 51-54
LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2017.0152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban is metabolized in the liver via CYP3A4, the cytochrome 
      involved in the metabolism of nearly 50% of all medications. Thus, its effective 
      concentration depends on multiple pharmacologic parameters. METHODS: The primary 
      goal of our research was to study the correlation between the CYP3A family 
      activity and the safety and efficacy of anticoagulant therapy with rivaroxaban in 
      patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Thirty one patients with DVT aged 21-83 
      years, 18 men and 13 women, received rivaroxaban (Xarelto) 30 mg/day for 21 days 
      after diagnosis and 20 mg/day for the follow-up period of 6 months. During the 
      study period, Doppler ultrasound was performed weekly to assess the clot dynamics 
      and recanalization time. RESULTS: We found a direct statistically reliable 
      correlation between CYP3A4 activity and both peak and trough rivaroxaban levels. 
      A correlation was also found between the initial clot length and the time to full 
      recanalization r = 0.764 (0.554-0.883), p < 0.0001. No significant link was found 
      between either the glomerular filtration rate and peak rivaroxaban concentrations 
      or between CYP3A4 activity and the treatment effectiveness parameters. No 
      connection between renal function and rivaroxaban concentration was established 
      in our study, which agrees with the clinical trials data that allow unlimited 
      rivaroxaban use in patients with glomerular filtration rate >30 mL/min. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The direct link between the initial clot length and time to full 
      recanalization that has been found means that patients with more advanced stages 
      of thrombosis need more time to reach recanalization than their counterparts with 
      a less severe condition.

TI  - Rivaroxaban: practical considerations for ensuring safety and efficacy.
PG  - 1223-45
LID - 10.1002/phar.1289 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is the first agent available within a new class of anticoagulants 
      called direct factor Xa inhibitors. Rivaroxaban is approved for use in the United 
      States for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in 
      patients undergoing total hip replacement and total knee replacement, for the 
      treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and for the reduction 
      in risk of recurrence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (with 
      additional indications under review). Rivaroxaban dose and frequency of 
      administration vary depending on the indication. As of result of predictable 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, a fixed dose of rivaroxaban is 
      administered without routine coagulation testing. Rivaroxaban has a short 
      half-life, undergoes a dual mode of elimination (hepatic and renal), and is a 
      substrate for P-glycoprotein. Rivaroxaban has a lower potential for drug 
      interactions compared with warfarin. Despite the advantages of a once/day 
      fixed-dose oral agent, in many clinical situations limited evidence is available 
      to guide optimal management of rivaroxaban therapy. In this article, we review 
      the available evidence and provide recommendations where possible for such 
      situations including the desire to monitor the anticoagulation intensity, use in 
      special patient populations, managing drug interactions, and transitioning across 
      anticoagulant agents. Potential strategies for reversing rivaroxaban's 
      anticoagulant effect are reviewed. Health systems will need to perform a 
      systematic safety evaluation and ensure that numerous hospital policies related 
      to anticoagulation are updated to include rivaroxaban. A comprehensive approach 
      to education is needed for clinicians, patients, and technical support personnel 
      involved in patient interactions to ensure safe use.

      based on measured creatinine clearance: healthy controls (≥80ml min(-1) ), mild 
      (50-79mlmin(-1) ), moderate (30-49mlmin(-1) ) and severe impairment (<30mlmin(-1) 
      ). RESULTS: Renal clearance of rivaroxaban decreased with increasing renal 
      impairment. Thus, plasma concentrations increased and area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) LS-mean values were 1.44-fold (90% confidence 
      interval [CI] 1.1, 1.9; mild), 1.52-fold (90% CI 1.2, 2.0; moderate) and 
      1.64-fold (90% CI 1.2, 2.2; severe impairment) higher than in healthy controls. 
      Corresponding values for the LS-mean of the AUC for prolongation of prothrombin 
      time were 1.33-fold (90% CI 0.92, 1.92; mild), 2.16-fold (90% CI 1.51, 3.10 
      moderate) and 2.44-fold (90% CI 1.70, 3.49 severe) higher than in healthy 
      subjects, respectively. Likewise, the LS-mean of the AUC for Factor Xa inhibition 
      in subjects with mild renal impairment was 1.50-fold (90% CI 1.07, 2.10) higher 
      than in healthy subjects. In subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment, 
      the increase was 1.86-fold (90% CI 1.34, 2.59) and 2.0-fold (90% CI 1.44, 2.78) 
      higher than in healthy subjects, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Rivaroxaban clearance 
      is decreased with increasing renal impairment, leading to increased plasma 
      exposure and pharmacodynamic effects, as expected for a partially renally 
      excreted drug. However, the influence of renal function on rivaroxaban clearance 
      was moderate, even in subjects with severe renal impairment.

TI  - Effect of Clarithromycin, a Strong CYP3A and P-glycoprotein Inhibitor, on the 
      Pharmacokinetics of Edoxaban in Healthy Volunteers and the Evaluation of the Drug 
      Interaction with Other Oral Factor Xa Inhibitors by a Microdose Cocktail 
      Approach.
PG  - 747-756
LID - 10.1007/s10557-023-07443-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We assessed the differential effect of clarithromycin, a strong 
      inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein, on the 
      pharmacokinetics of a regular dose of edoxaban and on a microdose cocktail of 
      factor Xa inhibitors (FXaI). Concurrently, CYP3A activity was determined with a 
      midazolam microdose. METHODS: In an open-label fixed-sequence trial in 12 healthy 
      volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of a microdosed FXaI cocktail (μ-FXaI; 25 μg 
      apixaban, 50 μg edoxaban, and 25 μg rivaroxaban) and of 60 mg edoxaban before and 
      during clarithromycin (2 x 500 mg/d) dosed to steady-state was evaluated. Plasma 
      concentrations of study drugs were quantified using validated ultra-performance 
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods. RESULTS: Therapeutic 
      clarithromycin doses increased the exposure of a therapeutic 60 mg dose of 
      edoxaban with a geometric mean ratio (GMR) of the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) of 1.53 (90 % CI: 1.37-1.70; p < 0.0001). 
      Clarithromycin also increased the GMR (90% CI) of the exposure of microdosed FXaI 
      apixaban to 1.38 (1.26-1.51), edoxaban to 2.03 (1.84-2.24), and rivaroxaban to 
      1.44 (1.27-1.63). AUC changes observed for the therapeutic edoxaban dose were 
      significantly smaller than those observed with the microdose (p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: Clarithromycin increases FXaI exposure. However, the magnitude of 
      this drug interaction is not expected to be clinically relevant. The edoxaban 
      microdose overestimates the extent of the drug interaction with the therapeutic 
      dose, whereas AUC ratios for apixaban and rivaroxaban were comparable to the 
      interaction with therapeutic doses as reported in the literature. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: EudraCT Number: 2018-002490-22.

TI  - Case series of massive direct oral anticoagulant ingestion-Treatment and 
      pharmacokinetics data.
PG  - e13746
LID - 10.1111/eci.13746 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are widely used due to favourable 
      benefit/risk ratio. However, consequences of massive ingestion have been poorly 
      investigated. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to report outcome and pharmacokinetic 
      parameters in patients who massively ingested DOACs. METHODS: We conducted a 
      5-year cohort study including consecutive massive DOAC ingestion patients 
      admitted to two critical care departments. Patients were managed in accordance 
      with standards of care. We collected the main history, clinical, laboratory, 
      management and outcome data. The time-course of plasma DOAC concentrations 
      measured using specific assays was modelled. RESULTS: Twelve patients (3F/9M; 
      age, 55 years [41-63], median [25th-75th percentiles]) were included. Ingestions 
      involved rivaroxaban (n = 7), apixaban (n = 3) and dabigatran (n = 2), with 
      presumed doses of 9.4-fold [5.0-22.0] the full daily dose. Six patients received 
      activated charcoal but no antidote nor blood-derived product. No bleeding was 
      observed. One patient died due to refractory cardiogenic shock related to 
      bisoprolol co-intoxication. Highest observed peak plasma concentrations were 
      1720 ng/ml (rivaroxaban), 750 ng/ml (apixaban) and 644 ng/ml (dabigatran). Times 
      to reach DOAC concentration below 50 ng/ml were ~20-45 h (rivaroxaban), ~125 h 
      (apixaban) and ~30-50 h (dabigatran). Elimination half-lives were 2.5-25.5 h 
      (rivaroxaban), 22.0 and 36.5 h (apixaban), and 5.8 and 15.5 h (dabigatran), with 
      substantial interindividual variability and prolongation in case of 
      cardiovascular failure related to co-intoxicants. Charcoal administration, even 
      if delayed, may have contributed to limit toxicity, possibly by reducing 
      absorption and/or enteroenteric recycling. CONCLUSION: No bleeding was observed 
      in this series of massive DOAC ingestions despite elevated plasma concentrations. 
      No patient required specific haemostatic agents. Charcoal administration should 
      be considered to limit toxicity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vitamin K antagonists were the only oral anticoagulants available 
      for several decades, but they require frequent coagulation monitoring and dose 
      adjustment. The direct oral anticoagulants rivaroxaban , dabigatran, apixaban, 
      and, most recently, edoxaban have been approved for the management of specific 
      thromboembolic indications. AREAS COVERED: This review will provide a brief 
      overview of the cell-based coagulation model, the main determinants of arterial 
      and venous thrombosis, and the pharmacological rationale and clinical evidence 
      for the different dosing regimens of rivaroxaban. Published articles indexed on 
      PubMed and Medline covering arterial and venous thrombi pathophysiology, 
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban, and Phase II and Phase III 
      clinical studies with rivaroxaban as well as real-world evidence were analyzed. 
      EXPERT OPINION: Education on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics, as 
      well as how to manage adverse events, is needed to increase physician knowledge 
      and confidence in using direct oral anticoagulants, as specifically discussed for 
      rivaroxaban in this article. The continued uptake of direct oral anticoagulants 
      in clinical practice depends on understanding of the clinical evidence and 
      reassurance provided by emerging real-world data.

TI  - Prevalence and factors associated with inappropriate dosing of apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban in hospitalized older adults with atrial fibrillation: a 
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 55-64
LID - 10.1007/s40266-023-01081-x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common condition among older adults, 
      requiring anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events. Direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) are now recommended as first-line therapy for this 
      purpose. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are two direct-factor Xa inhibitors whose 
      dosing is based on various factors (age, weight, creatinine, and creatinine 
      clearance) that can affect the pharmacokinetics of the medication. This study 
      aimed to evaluate factors associated with inappropriate dosing of apixaban or 
      rivaroxaban based on the summary of product characteristics. METHODS: A 
      retrospective, single-center study included 777 hospitalizations of patients 
      treated with apixaban or rivaroxaban for AF between 1 January 2018 and 31 
      December 2022. Primary endpoint assessed whether the dose of apixaban or 
      rivaroxaban was within the summary of product characteristics used by European 
      Medicine Agency (EMA). RESULTS: Inappropriate dosing of apixaban or rivaroxaban 
      is noted for approximately 30% of hospitalizations mostly underdosing. Factors 
      associated with the risk of inappropriate dosing were the presence of cognitive 
      impairment [adjusted odds ratio (OR*) 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      1.19-2.29, p value (p) = 0.002], weight per kilogram increase (OR* 1.03, 95% CI 
      1.01-1.04, p < 0.0001), and history of bleeding under apixaban or rivaroxaban 
      (OR* 1.94, 95% CI 1.24-3.03, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the 
      high prevalence of inappropriate apixaban or rivaroxaban doses in older adults, 
      particularly underdosing, which increases the risk of thromboembolism.

      Concentrations.
PG  - 28-36
LID - 10.1177/10600280231158929 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban has predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 
      However, monitoring rivaroxaban concentrations should be provided for special 
      patients with hepatic insufficiency, high bleeding risk, and high thrombotic 
      risk. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to correlate chromogenic anti-Xa assay, 
      prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 
      thromboelastogram reaction time (TEG R-time), and rivaroxaban concentration 
      measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (HPLC-MS/MS) (MS-Riva). METHODS: Peripheral venous blood was collected from 
      recruited patients 30 minutes before and 2 to 4 hours after drug administration. 
      High-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and chromogenic 
      anti-Xa assay measured rivaroxaban concentration. Different assays were compared 
      by Pearson correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: A total of 
      104 patients with 191 plasma were included in the study. Overall analysis shows 
      that chromogenic anti-Xa assay, PT, APTT, and TEG R-time strongly correlated with 
      MS-Riva (r = 0.986; r = 0.884; r = 0.741; r = 0.739; P < 0.001). Rivaroxaban peak 
      concentration detected by HPLC-MS/MS (MS-peak) showed a very strong correlation 
      with the chromogenic anti-Xa assay (r = 0.977, P < 0.001) and moderate 
      correlation with PT, APTT, and TEG R-time (r = 0.670; r = 0.571; r = 0.481, P < 
      0.001). Rivaroxaban trough concentration detected by HPLC-MS/MS (MS-trough) 
      correlated strongly with the chromogenic anti-Xa assay (r = 0.884, P < 0.001), 
      weakly with APTT (r = 0.313; P = 0.043), and not significantly with PT and TEG 
      R-time (P = 0.140; P = 0.341). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: High-performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry/MS is the preferred choice for monitoring 
      peak and tough concentrations, followed by anti-Xa, while PT is only suitable for 
      peak concentrations. This study can help the clinicians to better adjust the 
      medication regimen and reduce the risk of recurrence of thrombosis as well as the 
      risk of bleeding.

TI  - Real-world effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban versus warfarin among 
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients with obesity in a US population.
PG  - 881-890
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2021.1901223 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Current evidence indicates that the pharmacokinetic profile of 
      rivaroxaban is not significantly impacted by body weight. However, real-world 
      data are needed to better assess the potential clinical benefits and risks 
      associated with rivaroxaban in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients 
      with obesity. Thus, our objectives were to assess the real-world effectiveness 
      and safety of rivaroxaban versus warfarin among NVAF patients with obesity in the 
      US nationally representative commercially-insured population. METHODS: Health 
      insurance claims data from the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus database (January 
      2010-September 2019) were used to identify NVAF patients with obesity (based on 
      diagnosis codes) initiated on rivaroxaban or warfarin. Inverse probability of 
      treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to adjust for imbalances between groups. 
      Study outcomes of interest were evaluated up to 36 months post-treatment 
      initiation and included the composite of stroke or systemic embolism (stroke/SE) 
      and major bleeding. Outcomes were compared using Cox proportional hazards 
      regression models with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
      RESULTS: A total of 10,555 patients were initiated on rivaroxaban and 5080 
      patients on warfarin. Following IPTW, the risk of stroke/SE was 26% lower among 
      patients prescribed rivaroxaban relative to warfarin (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.60, 
      0.91, p = .004) at 36 months. Rivaroxaban-initiated patients had a risk of major 
      bleeding similar to that of warfarin-initiated patients (HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.71, 
      1.02, p = .085). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that rivaroxaban is an 
      effective and safe treatment option among NVAF patients with obesity in a 
      commercially-insured US population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are widely prescribed for 
      stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). An important 
      advantage of DOACs is that routine monitoring of an anticoagulation response is 
      not necessary. Nevertheless, because of their mechanism of action, a DOAC 
      anticoagulation effect can be inferred based on the observed plasma 
      concentration. However, there is a paucity of data relating to observed 
      interpatient variation in DOAC plasma concentrations in the postmarket clinical 
      setting. METHODS: We determined rivaroxaban and apixaban plasma concentrations in 
      patients with AF during routine clinic visits. RESULTS: Among 243 patients 
      (rivaroxaban, n = 94; apixaban, n = 149) enrolled in this study, a 60- and 
      50-fold interpatient variation in plasma concentration was observed for 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban, respectively. Approximately 12% of patients receiving 
      rivaroxaban and 13% of patients receiving apixaban exceeded the 95th percentile 
      for predicted maximum plasma concentration observed in clinical trials. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this routine-care setting, rivaroxaban and apixaban plasma 
      concentrations tended to be more variable than those observed in clinical trials. 
      Identification of additional clinical and molecular determinants that more fully 
      predict patients at risk for excessively high or low DOAC concentrations may 
      enable a more precise DOAC dosing regimen for the individual patient.

      anticoagulants require a simple, rapid, and reliable analytical method for 
      monitoring plasma concentrations. The aims of the current work were to develop 
      and validate a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method for the 
      simultaneous determination of 3 direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, and apixaban) in human plasma that is suitable for pharmacokinetic 
      studies and routine therapeutic drug monitoring in busy hospital laboratories. 
      METHODS: This method included a hydrolysis step to account for the active 
      acylglucuronide metabolites of dabigatran that demonstrate an equivalent 
      anticoagulant effect as dabigatran. After hydrolysis, a simple one-step protein 
      precipitation was used for sample preparation. Total dabigatran (the sum of free 
      dabigatran and the contribution from dabigatran acylglucuronides), rivaroxaban, 
      and apixaban, and their corresponding isotopically labeled internal standards 
      were resolved on a C18(2) column. All compounds were detected using electrospray 
      ionization liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry in the positive mode. 
      RESULTS: For all 3 anticoagulants, standard curves were linear over the 
      concentration range of 1.0-1000 mcg/L (r > 0.99), bias was < ±10%, and intraday 
      and interday coefficients of variation (imprecision) were <10%. The limit of 
      quantification was 1.0 mcg/L. For all 3 anticoagulants and corresponding 
      isotopically labeled internal standards, the absolute recoveries were similar and 
      consistent, with mean values of 93%-102%. No significant matrix effects were 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: This method is simple, rapid, robust, and reliable and can 
      be used to analyze the plasma concentrations of the drugs in patients on 
      dabigatran or rivaroxaban therapy.

AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is characterized by pulmonary embolism and 
      deep vein thrombosis, has become a serious public concern. Notably, over half of 
      the patients with VTE are over 70 years of age, but elderly patients are at high 
      risk of anti-coagulation and bleeding, which increase with age. Moreover, risk 
      factors and frailty also show a difference between elderly patients and ordinary 
      patients diagnosed with VTE. Rivaroxaban is a direct inhibitor of activated 
      factor Xa and has the advantage of predictable pharmacodynamics and 
      pharmacokinetics, no coagulation monitoring, and few drug interactions. As a 
      first-line therapy for VTE, this drug is more advantageous than traditional 
      therapy and exhibits good efficacy and safety for ordinary patients. However, the 
      effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban in elderly patients have not been fully 
      elucidated. This article reviewed the use of rivaroxaban in elderly patients, 
      including drug interactions, monitoring, reversal agents of rivaroxaban, and the 
      use of small dosages of rivaroxaban in elderly patients.

AB  - Intravenous andexanet alfa [coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), 
      inactivated-zhzo; Andexxa(®)] is a first-in-class recombinant modified factor Xa 
      protein that has been developed by Portola Pharmaceuticals as a universal 
      antidote to reverse anticoagulant effects of direct or indirect factor Xa 
      inhibitors. In May 2018, andexanet alfa received its first global approval in the 
      USA for use in patients treated with rivaroxaban and apixaban, when reversal of 
      anticoagulant effects is required in life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. 
      Intravenous andexanet alfa is under regulatory review in the EU and is undergoing 
      clinical development in Japan. This article summarizes the milestones in the 
      development of andexanet alfa leading to this first global approval for reversing 
      anticoagulation of rivaroxaban and apixaban in adults.

TI  - Anticoagulant therapy with the oral direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban and edoxaban and the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate in patients 
      with hepatic impairment.
PG  - 243-54
LID - 10.1007/s40262-013-0034-0 [doi]
AB  - The direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban, and the 
      thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate (dabigatran) have gained approval for use 
      in several indications, most notably for the prevention and treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) and for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation. Hepatic impairment can affect the disposition of these 
      anticoagulants considerably not only because of the hepatic metabolism of the 
      direct FXa inhibitors but also because moderate to severely impaired hepatic 
      function will affect coagulation. This review describes the key pharmacological 
      properties of novel oral anticoagulants with special attention to patients with 
      impaired hepatic function. In subjects with moderately impaired liver function 
      (i.e. Child-Pugh classification B), the area under the plasma concentration-time 
      curve (AUC) of rivaroxaban (10 mg single dose) is increased by 2.27-fold, which 
      is paralleled by an increase in FXa inhibition. The AUC of apixaban (5 mg single 
      dose) is increased by 1.09-fold, whereas the AUC of edoxaban (15 mg single dose) 
      is decreased by 4.8 % and the AUC of dabigatran (150 mg single dose) is decreased 
      by 5.6 %. Specific labelling restrictions for rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      dabigatran regarding impaired hepatic function are based on both the Child-Pugh 
      classification and liver-related exclusion criteria applied in pivotal clinical 
      trials. Rivaroxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease 
      associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk, including 
      cirrhotic patients classified as Child-Pugh B and C. Apixaban can be used with 
      caution in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic 
      impairment or in patients with alanine aminotransferase and aspartate 
      aminotransferase levels >2× upper limit of normal (ULN). Apixaban is not 
      recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is contraindicated in 
      those with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant 
      bleeding risk. Dabigatran is not recommended in patients with elevated liver 
      enzymes (>2× ULN). Dabigatran is contraindicated in patients with hepatic 
      impairment or liver disease expected to have any impact on survival. Currently, 
      edoxaban is not available in the US or European markets. However, the Japanese 
      label did not restrict use in hepatic dysfunction but advises care in patients 
      with severe hepatic impairment.

AB  - Anticoagulant plasma concentrations and patient characteristics might affect the 
      benefit-risk balance of therapy. The study objective was to assess the impact of 
      model-predicted rivaroxaban exposure and patient characteristics on outcomes in 
      patients receiving rivaroxaban for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis 
      (VTE-P) after hip/knee replacement surgery. Post hoc exposure-response analyses 
      were conducted using data from the phase 3 RECORD1-4 studies, in which 12,729 
      patients were randomized to rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily or enoxaparin 
      for ≤ 39 days. Multivariate regression approaches were used to correlate 
      model-predicted individual rivaroxaban exposures and patient characteristics with 
      outcomes. In the absence of measured rivaroxaban exposure, exposure estimates 
      were predicted based on individual increases in prothrombin time (PT) and by 
      making use of the known correlation between rivaroxaban plasma concentration and 
      dynamics of PT. No significant associations between rivaroxaban exposure and 
      total VTE or major bleeding were identified. A significant association between 
      exposure and a composite of major or non-major clinically relevant (NMCR) 
      bleeding from day 4 after surgery was observed. The relationship was shallow, 
      with an approximate predicted absolute increase in a composite of major or NMCR 
      bleeding from 1.08 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76-1.54] to 2.18% (95% CI 
      1.51-3.17) at the 5th and 95th percentiles of trough plasma concentration, 
      respectively. In conclusion, based on the underlying data and analysis, no 
      reliable target window for exposure with improved benefit-risk could be 
      identified within the investigated exposure range. Hence, monitoring rivaroxaban 
      levels is unlikely to be beneficial in VTE-P.

TI  - Systematic Development and Verification of a Physiologically Based 
      Pharmacokinetic Model of Rivaroxaban.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is indicated for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation 
      (AF). Its elimination is mediated by both hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. 
      Consequently, its clearance is susceptible to both intrinsic (pathophysiological) 
      and extrinsic (concomitant drugs) variabilities that in turn implicate bleeding 
      risks. Upon systematic model verification, physiologically based pharmacokinetic 
      (PBPK) models are qualified for the quantitative rationalization of complex 
      drug-drug-disease interactions (DDDIs). Hence, this study aimed to develop and 
      verify a PBPK model of rivaroxaban systematically. Key parameters required to 
      define rivaroxaban's disposition were either obtained from in vivo data or 
      generated via in vitro metabolism and transport kinetic assays. Our developed 
      PBPK model successfully predicted rivaroxaban's clinical pharmacokinetic 
      parameters within predefined success metrics. Consideration of basolateral 
      organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3)-mediated proximal tubular uptake in tandem 
      with apical P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux facilitated mechanistic 
      characterization of the renal elimination of rivaroxaban in both healthy and 
      renal impaired patients. Retrospective drug-drug interaction (DDI) simulations, 
      incorporating in vitro metabolic inhibitory parameters, accurately recapitulated 
      clinically observed attenuation of rivaroxaban's hepatic clearance due to 
      enzyme-mediated DDIs with CYP3A4/2J2 inhibitors (verapamil and ketoconazole). 
      Notably, transporter-mediated DDI simulations between rivaroxaban and the P-gp 
      inhibitor ketoconazole yielded minimal increases in rivaroxaban's systemic 
      exposure when P-gp-mediated efflux was solely inhibited, but were successfully 
      characterized when concomitant basolateral uptake inhibition was incorporated in 
      the simulation. In conclusion, our developed PBPK model of rivaroxaban is 
      systematically verified for prospective interrogation and management of untested 
      yet clinically relevant DDDIs pertinent to AF management using rivaroxaban. 
      SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Rivaroxaban is susceptible to DDDIs comprising renal 
      impairment and P-gp and CYP3A4/2J2 inhibition. Here, systematic construction and 
      verification of a PBPK model of rivaroxaban, with the inclusion of a mechanistic 
      kidney component, provided insight into the previously arcane role of 
      OAT3-mediated basolateral uptake in influencing both clinically observed renal 
      elimination of rivaroxaban and differential extents of transporter-mediated DDIs. 
      The verified model holds potential for investigating clinically relevant DDDIs 
      involving rivaroxaban and designing dosing adjustments to optimize its 
      pharmacotherapy in atrial fibrillation.

AB  - Anticoagulant plasma concentrations and patient characteristics might affect the 
      benefit-risk balance of therapy. This study assessed the impact of 
      model-predicted rivaroxaban exposure and patient characteristics on outcomes in 
      patients receiving rivaroxaban for venous thromboembolism treatment (VTE-T) using 
      data from the phase 3 EINSTEIN-DVT and EINSTEIN-PE studies. In the absence of 
      measured rivaroxaban exposure, exposure estimates were predicted based on 
      individual increases in prothrombin time (PT) and the known correlation between 
      rivaroxaban plasma concentrations and PT dynamics. The composite efficacy 
      outcomes evaluated were recurrent deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary 
      embolism (PE) and recurrent DVT, PE and all-cause death; safety outcomes were 
      major bleeding and the composite of major or non-major clinically relevant (NMCR) 
      bleeding. Exposure-response relationships were evaluated using multivariate 
      logistic and Cox regression for the twice-daily (BID) and once-daily (OD) dosing 
      periods, respectively. Predicted rivaroxaban exposure and CrCl were significantly 
      associated with both efficacy outcomes in the BID period. In the OD period, 
      exposure was significantly associated with recurrent DVT and PE but not recurrent 
      DVT, PE and all-cause death. The statistically significant exposure-efficacy 
      relationships were shallow. Exposure-safety relationships were absent within the 
      investigated exposure range. During both dosing periods, low baseline hemoglobin 
      and prior bleeding were associated with the composite of major or NMCR bleeding. 
      In conclusion, based on the underlying data and analysis, no reliable target 
      window for exposure with improved benefit-risk could be identified within the 
      investigated exposure range. Therefore, monitoring rivaroxaban levels is unlikely 
      to be beneficial in VTE-T.

TI  - Direct oral anticoagulants in trauma patients.
PG  - 93-100
LID - 10.1097/ACO.0000000000001356 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly prescribed 
      for prevention of thromboembolic events. Thus, trauma care providers are facing a 
      steadily raising number of injured patients on DOACs. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite a 
      predictable pharmacokinetic profile, the resulting plasma levels of trauma 
      patients upon admission and bleeding risks remain uncertain. Therefore, recent 
      guidelines recommend the measurement of DOAC plasma concentrations in injured 
      patients. Alternatively, DOAC specific visco-elastic tests assays can be applied 
      to identify DOAC patients at bleeding risk.Bleeding complications in trauma 
      patients on DOACs are generally higher compared to nonanticoagulated subjects, 
      but comparable to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). In particular, a traumatic brain 
      injury does not carry an increased risk of intracranial bleeding due to a DOAK 
      intake compared to VKAs. Current studies demonstrated that up to 14% of patients 
      with a hip fracture are on DOACs prior to surgery. However, the majority can be 
      operated safely within a 24h time window without an increased bleeding 
      rate.Specific antagonists facilitate rapid reversal of patients on DOACs. 
      Idarucizumab for dabigatran, and andexanet alfa for apixaban and rivaroxaban have 
      been approved for life threatening bleeding. Alternatively, prothrombin complex 
      concentrate can be used. Dialysis is a potential treatment option for dabigatran 
      and haemoabsorption with special filters can be applied in patients on 
      FXa-inhibitors. SUMMARY: Current guidelines recommend the measurement of DOAC 
      plasma levels in trauma patients. Compared to VKAs, DOACs do not carry a higher 
      bleeding risk. DOAC specific antagonists facilitate the individual bleeding 
      management.

TI  - Effect of ABCB1 gene variants on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetic and hemorrhage 
      events occurring in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 163-171
LID - 10.1002/bdd.2327 [doi]
AB  - Hemorrhage events occur most frequently in anticoagulant therapy for non-valvular 
      atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Rivaroxaban is used widely for routine 
      anticoagulation care. Genetic polymorphisms are thought to contribute to the wide 
      intraindividual variability seen in rivaroxaban metabolism and the anticoagulant 
      response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of drug transport 
      related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on rivaroxaban metabolism and on 
      the risk of a hemorrhage event. A total of 216 Chinese patients with NVAF were 
      enrolled in the study. Rivaroxaban was used for anticoagulation therapy. 
      Rivaroxaban plasma concentrations were detected using a validated 
      ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) 
      method. Seven SNPs in four genes were genotyped using the Sanger dideoxy DNA 
      sequencing method. Associations between genotype variants, the incidence of 
      hemorrhage events, and the time of bleeding were analyzed. ABCB1 2677G 
      (rs2032582) variation was highly associated with the dose-adjusted rivaroxaban 
      peak concentration in plasma (C(max) /D) (p = 0.025, FDR = 0.042). The ABCB1 G 
      allele carriers had a higher rivaroxaban C(max) /D than non-carriers. Logistic 
      regression showed that rivaroxaban C(max) /D and ABCB1 genotype variants were 
      associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhage events. No statistically 
      significant difference was found between ABCB1 genotypes and the time of bleeding 
      after anticoagulant therapy in 30 days. These results indicated that ABCB1 2677G 
      (rs2032582) genetic variant affects the rivaroxaban C(max) /Dose and the 
      incidence of hemorrhage events significantly.

AB  - Rivaroxaban exposure and patient characteristics may affect the rivaroxaban 
      benefit-risk balance. This study aimed to quantify associations between 
      model-predicted rivaroxaban exposure and patient characteristics and efficacy and 
      safety outcomes in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), using 
      data from the phase 3 ROCKET AF trial (NCT00403767). In ROCKET AF, 14,264 
      patients with NVAF were randomized to rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily [OD], or 
      15 mg OD if creatinine clearance was 30-49 mL/min) or dose-adjusted warfarin 
      (median follow-up: 707 days); rivaroxaban plasma concentration was measured in a 
      subset of 161 patients. In this post hoc exposure-response analysis, a 
      multivariate Cox model was used to correlate individual predicted rivaroxaban 
      exposures and patient characteristics with time-to-event efficacy and safety 
      outcomes in 7061 and 7111 patients, respectively. There was no significant 
      association between model-predicted rivaroxaban trough plasma concentration 
      (C(trough)) and efficacy outcomes. Creatinine clearance and history of stroke 
      were significantly associated with efficacy outcomes. C(trough) was significantly 
      associated with the composite of major or non-major clinically relevant (NMCR) 
      bleeding (hazard ratio [95th percentile vs. median]: 1.26 [95% confidence 
      interval 1.13-1.40]) but not with major bleeding alone. The exposure-response 
      relationship for major or NMCR bleeding was shallow with no clear threshold for 
      an acceleration in risk. History of gastrointestinal bleeding had a greater 
      influence on safety outcomes than C(trough). These results support fixed 
      rivaroxaban 15 mg and 20 mg OD dosages in NVAF. Therapeutic drug monitoring is 
      unlikely to offer clinical benefits in this indication beyond evaluation of 
      patient characteristics.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo P-glycoprotein transport characteristics of rivaroxaban.
PG  - 372-80
LID - 10.1124/jpet.111.180240 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban, an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor, has a dual mode of elimination 
      in humans, with two-thirds metabolized by the liver and one-third renally 
      excreted unchanged. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is known to be involved in the 
      absorption, distribution, and excretion of drugs. To investigate whether 
      rivaroxaban is a substrate of P-gp, the bidirectional flux of rivaroxaban across 
      Caco-2, wild-type, and P-gp-overexpressing LLC-PK1 cells was investigated. 
      Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of rivaroxaban toward P-gp was determined. 
      Rivaroxaban exhibited high permeability and polarized transport across Caco-2 
      cells. Rivaroxaban was shown to be a substrate for, but not an inhibitor of, 
      P-gp. Of a set of potential P-gp inhibitors, ketoconazole and ritonavir, but not 
      clarithromycin or erythromycin, inhibited P-gp-mediated transport of rivaroxaban, 
      with half-maximal inhibitory concentration values in the range of therapeutic 
      plasma concentrations. These findings are in line with observed area under the 
      plasma concentration-time curve increases in clinical drug-drug interaction 
      studies indicating a possible involvement of P-gp in the distribution and 
      excretion of rivaroxaban. In vivo studies in wild-type and P-gp double-knockout 
      mice demonstrated that the impact of P-gp alone on the pharmacokinetics of 
      rivaroxaban is minor. However, in P-gp double-knockout mice, a slight increase in 
      brain concentrations and decreased excretion into the gastrointestinal tract were 
      observed compared with wild-type mice. These studies also demonstrated that brain 
      penetration of rivaroxaban is fairly low. In addition to P-gp, a further 
      transport protein might be involved in the secretion of rivaroxaban.

TI  - Drug-drug interaction of rivaroxaban and calcium channel blockers in patients 
      aged 80 years and older with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
LID - 10.1515/dmpt-2020-0127 [doi]
AB  - Objectives For revealing the peculiarities of the drug-drug interaction of 
      rivaroxaban (substrate CYP3A4 and P-gp) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) 
      (verapamil - inhibitor CYP3A4 and P-gp and amlodipine - substrate CYP3A4) in 
      patients 80 years and older with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NAF) we studied 
      128 patients. Methods All patients were divided into groups depending on the 
      therapy taken: the 1st - rivaroxaban + amlodipine (n=51), the 2nd - rivaroxaban + 
      verapamil (n=30), the control group - rivaroxaban without CCBs (n=47). A trough 
      steady-state plasma concentration (C min,ss) of rivaroxaban, prothrombin time 
      (PT) in the blood plasma and the event of clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) 
      bleeding were assessed for each patient. Results Patient in group 2 had higher C 
      min,ss of rivaroxaban, PT and CRNM than subjects in the control group (Me 73.8 
      [50.6-108.8] ng/mL vs. 40.5 [25.6-74.3] ng/mL; Me 14.8 [13.4-17.3] s vs. 13.8 
      [12.6-14.4] s; 34% vs. 13%, respectively, p<0.05 for all). When compared, the PT 
      and complication rate in group 1 with the control group C min,ss of rivaroxaban 
      were practically the same (p>0.05 for all). Conclusions In patients ≥80 years 
      with NAF, the use of rivaroxaban in combination with verapamil may not be safe 
      and can lead to CRNM bleeding.

AB  - To study the effects of metabolic enzyme activity inhibition and genetic 
      polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban, we 
      established an in vitro enzymatic reaction system to screen for inhibitors, and 
      used the UPLC-MS/MS method to detect the levels of rivaroxaban and its metabolite 
      M2-1. Additionally, in vivo pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies were 
      conducted using Sprague-Dawley rats. Human recombinant CYP2J2 baculosomes were 
      prepared using a baculovirus-insect expression system to investigate the impact 
      of genetic polymorphisms on rivaroxaban metabolism through enzyme kinetics 
      methods. The results demonstrated that acid-suppressing drugs strongly inhibited 
      the metabolism of rivaroxaban in vitro. Among them, vonoprazan significantly 
      increased the systemic exposure of rivaroxaban in vivo, while also prolonging 
      prothrombin time, likely due to the competitive binding of vonoprazan and 
      rivaroxaban to CYP2J2. Moreover, the genetic polymorphisms of CYP2J2 determined 
      the metabolic characteristics of rivaroxaban and the inhibitory potency of 
      vonoprazan. Overall, our findings suggest that vonoprazan-induced inhibition of 
      CYP2J2 activity can affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      rivaroxaban, with the extent of inhibition determined by the genetic polymorphism 
      of CYP2J2. These insights have important implications for the precise management 
      of rivaroxaban in humans.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are the main therapeutic agents used 
      to prevent embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Despite 
      their proven efficacy, VKAs are underused and have several limitations. In recent 
      years, there has been great interest in the development of new oral 
      anticoagulants with a more efficient pharmacological profile, first tested in 
      venous thromboembolism prevention and later in AF. AREAS COVERED: The authors 
      review the pharmacological differences between dabigatran, rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban, and potential subgroups of patients in whom these new drugs would 
      constitute a possible alternative to VKA therapy. Pharmacodynamic and 
      pharmacokinetic data from each compound are analyzed in respect to their 
      potential use in AF. This article provides an exhaustive review of the current 
      status of this topic and the controversies still regarding each drug. EXPERT 
      OPINION: Apixaban and rivaroxaban are under evaluation for thromboembolic 
      prevention in AF; dabigatran was recently approved for this indication. 
      Therefore, it is important to know the characteristics of these drugs as a 
      potential alternative to VKAs.

AB  - PURPOSE: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are recommended in preference to 
      vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for stroke prevention in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) eligible for oral anticoagulation therapy; however, data and 
      clinical experiences supporting the use of DOACs in patients with a body mass 
      index ≥40 kg/m(2) or weight >120 kg remain limited. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of DOACs in patients with AF and extreme 
      obesity. METHODS: We enrolled all consecutive patients with AF and extreme 
      obesity undergoing treatment with DOACs followed up at Monaldi Hospital, Naples, 
      Italy. To determine peak plasma and trough levels of DOACs, plasma samples were 
      collected at 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 12th hours from the last dose intake in patients 
      receiving apixaban and dabigatran and at the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 24th hours in 
      those receiving edoxaban and rivaroxaban. The DOACs' peak and trough plasma 
      levels obtained from our study population were compared with those sourced from 
      pharmacokinetic studies among patients without obesity, defined as a normal 
      reference range in the literature. If at least 1 peak or trough plasma level was 
      found ​​below or above the normal reference ranges, the patients were classified 
      as having out-of-range DOAC plasma levels. Study population was then divided into 
      in-range and out-of-range groups. Baseline characteristics, including DOAC 
      treatment, were compared between the 2 groups. Univariate and multivariate 
      logistic regression analysis were performed to identify baseline variables 
      associated with DOACs' plasma concentration out of the expected range. FINDINGS: 
      A total of 58 patients (mean [SD] age, 70.93 [8.73] years; 40% female) with 
      extreme obesity (mean [SD] body mass index. 44.43 [3.54] kg/m(2)) and AF while 
      undergoing DOAC treatment were included in the present study. In 9 patients (15.5 
      %), the DOAC plasma concentrations were out of the expected ranges (out-of-range 
      group);, indicating a greater likelihood of edoxaban 30 mg treatment (33% vs 2%; 
      P < 0.01) and inappropriate DOAC underdosing (56% vs 4%; P < 0.005) compared with 
      the in-range group. According to the multivariate logistic analysis (P = 0.0011), 
      the inappropriate DOAC underdosing (hazard ratio = 29.37; P = 0.0002) was an 
      independent predictor of DOAC plasma levels out of the expected ranges. 
      IMPLICATIONS: Patients with extreme obesity and AF who were receiving DOAC 
      therapy had DOAC plasma concentrations in the expected range. The inappropriate 
      DOAC underdosing seems to be the only independent clinical factor associated with 
      a plasma concentration of the drug out of the expected range.

AB  - Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), as important metabolic 
      enzymes and transporters, participate in the biological transformation and 
      transport of many substances in the body. CYP3A and P-gp are closely related, 
      with very high substrate overlap and regulation similarity, making it 
      particularly difficult to investigate the function of one or the other 
      individually in vivo. Rivaroxaban and verapamil are commonly used together to 
      treat nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in clinical practice. However, this 
      combination therapy can increase systemic exposure to rivaroxaban and the risk of 
      major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. In this study, Cyp3a1/2 and Mdr1a/b 
      quadruple gene knockout (qKO) rat model was generated and characterized for the 
      first time. CYP3A1/2 and P-gp are completely absent in this novel rat model. 
      Then, the qKO rat model was applied for the evaluation of the drug-drug 
      interactions (DDI) between rivaroxaban and verapamil. The results demonstrated 
      that CYP3A and P-gp were jointly and selectively involved in the pharmacokinetic 
      interactions between rivaroxaban and verapamil. This study may provide useful 
      information for understanding the role of CYP3A and P-gp in rivaroxaban-verapamil 
      therapy and predicting the potential interaction between CYP3A and P-gp.

AB  - Administration of oral medicinal products as crushed tablets or open capsules is 
      an important delivery option for patients suffering from dysphagia. To obtain 
      full interchangeability of generics with the original products, demonstration of 
      bioequivalence (BE) between both products administered as crushed tablets/open 
      capsules was required for poorly soluble product by European Medicines Agency 
      (EMA) at the time of development of our rivaroxaban and deferasirox generic 
      products. We present the results of two BE studies with modified administration 
      of these products, which compared relative bioavailability between generic and 
      reference products. In the rivaroxaban study, the test product was administered 
      as a capsule sprinkled on and mixed with applesauce, whereas the reference tablet 
      was crushed and administered with applesauce under fed conditions. In the 
      deferasirox study, both treatments were administered as crushed tablets under 
      fasting conditions. Both studies applied a two-way crossover design and were 
      conducted after a single-dose in healthy volunteers. The 90% confidence interval 
      of the geometric mean ratio area under the analyte concentration versus time 
      curve, from time zero to the time of the last measurable analyte concentration 
      and maximum measured analyte concentration over the sampling period of the test 
      to reference ratio were 103.36-110.37% and 97.98-108.45% for rivaroxaban, 
      respectively, and 96.69-107.29% and 94.19-109.45% for deferasirox, respectively. 
      Thus, the BE criteria (80.00-125.00%) were met in both studies which demonstrated 
      that bioavailability was not affected when the test and reference products were 
      administered in the form of crushed tablet/open capsule. These results support 
      the argument of redundancy of crushed product studies for poorly soluble drugs, 
      which is in line with the currently revised position of the EMA on this topic.

AB  - A Micellar Chromatographic method to determine rivaroxaban in plasma and urine 
      has been developed. The samples were dissolved in the mobile phase (SDS 0.05 M - 
      1-propanol 12.5%, phosphate buffered at pH 7) and 20 μL directly injected, 
      avoiding the extraction and purification steps. Using a C18 column and running 
      under isocratic mode at 1 mL/min, analyte was eluted without interference from 
      the matrix in <6.0 min. The detection absorbance wavelength was set to 250 nm. 
      The procedure was validated by Food and Drug Administration guidelines in terms 
      of: system suitability, calibration range (0.05-5 mg/L), linearity, sensitivity, 
      robustness, carry-over effect, specificity, accuracy (-11.1 to 4.2%), precision 
      (<19.9%), stability and analysis of incurred samples. The method was found 
      reliable, practical, easy-to-conduct, rapid, relatively eco-friendly, safe, 
      inexpensive, widely available and with a high sample throughput. The method was 
      applied to the analysis of incurred samples, including incurred sample 
      reanalysis, to verify that the instrumentation works correctly. In addition, the 
      constants of the different partition equilibria occurring in the column were 
      elucidated in order to have a better comprehension of the theoretical aspects of 
      the retention mechanism. A moderately strong association between rivaroxaban and 
      the stationary phase and the micelles was found, weakened by short chain alcohol.

AB  - The evidence of rivaroxaban's pharmacokinetics in obese compared with non-obese 
      populations remains inconclusive. We aimed to compare the pharmacokinetic profile 
      of rivaroxaban between obese and non-obese populations under fed state. 
      Participants who met the study's eligibility criteria were assigned into one of 
      two groups: obese (body mass index ≥35 kg/m(2)) or non-obese (body mass index 
      18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)). A single dose of rivaroxaban 20 mg was orally administered to 
      each participant. Nine blood samples over 48 h, and multiple urine samples over 
      18 h were collected and analyzed for rivaroxaban concentration using 
      ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass detector. 
      Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using WinNonlin software. Thirty-six 
      participants were recruited into the study. No significant changes were observed 
      between obese and non-obese participants in peak plasma concentration, time to 
      reach peak plasma concentration, area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      over 48 h or to infinity, elimination rate constant, half-life, apparent volume 
      of distribution, apparent clearance, and fraction of drug excreted unchanged in 
      urine over 18 h. Rivaroxaban's exposure was similar between the obese and 
      non-obese subjects, and there were no significant differences in other 
      pharmacokinetic parameters between the two groups. These results suggest that 
      dose adjustment for rivaroxaban is probably unwarranted in the obese population.

AB  - A number of target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOAs) have been developed in 
      recent years, and some have shown considerable promise in large-scale, randomized 
      clinical trials in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolism. Unlike 
      traditional anticoagulants, such as vitamin K antagonists, these TSOAs exhibit 
      predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Among these agents, 
      rivaroxaban, a direct Factor Xa inhibitor, has been approved for clinical use in 
      many countries for the management of several thromboembolic disorders. As with 
      the other TSOAs, rivaroxaban is given at fixed doses without routine coagulation 
      monitoring. However, in certain patient populations or special clinical 
      circumstances, measurement of drug exposure may be useful, such as in suspected 
      overdose, in patients with a haemorrhagic or thromboembolic event during 
      treatment with an anticoagulant, in those with acute renal failure, or in 
      patients who require urgent surgery. This article summarizes the influence of 
      rivaroxaban on commonly used coagulation assays and provides practical guidance 
      on laboratory testing of rivaroxaban in routine practice. Both quantitative 
      measurement (using the anti-Factor Xa method) and qualitative measurement (using 
      prothrombin time, expressed in seconds) are discussed, together with some 
      practical considerations when performing these tests and interpreting the test 
      results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of rivaroxaban exposure 
      and patient characteristics on efficacy and safety outcomes in patients with 
      acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and to determine whether therapeutic drug 
      monitoring might provide additional information regarding rivaroxaban dose, 
      beyond what patient characteristics provide. METHODS: A post hoc 
      exposure-response analysis was conducted using data from the phase III ATLAS ACS 
      2 Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 51 study, in which 15,526 
      randomized ACS patients received rivaroxaban (2.5 mg or 5 mg twice daily) or 
      placebo for a mean of 13 months (maximum follow up: 31 months). A multivariate 
      Cox model was used to correlate individual predicted rivaroxaban exposures and 
      patient characteristics with time-to-event clinical outcomes. RESULTS: For the 
      incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, or nonhemorrhagic 
      cardiovascular death, hazard ratios (HRs) for steady-state maximum plasma 
      concentration (C(max)) in the 5th and 95th percentiles versus the median were 
      statistically significant but close to 1 for both rivaroxaban doses. For TIMI 
      major bleeding events, a statistically significant association was observed with 
      C(max) [HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.11 (95th percentile versus median, 2.5 mg twice 
      daily)], sex [HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.38-0.84 (female versus male)], and previous 
      revascularization [HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.44-0.87 (no versus yes)]. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      shallow slopes of the exposure-response relationships and the lack of a clear 
      therapeutic window render it unlikely that therapeutic drug monitoring in 
      patients with ACS would provide additional information regarding rivaroxaban dose 
      beyond that provided by patient characteristics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The chromogenic anti-Xa assay, the gold standard for monitoring the 
      anti-Xa effect of rivaroxaban, is not available as a cage-side diagnostic test 
      for use in a clinical setting. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate clinical 
      modalities for measuring the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban using a 
      point-of-care prothrombin time (PT) and thromboelastography (TEG). ANIMALS: Six 
      healthy Beagle dogs. METHODS: Prospective, experimental study. Four different 
      doses of rivaroxaban (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg) were administered PO to dogs. 
      Single PO and 3 consecutive dosing regimens also were assessed. Plasma 
      rivaroxaban concentration was determined using a chromogenic anti-Xa assay, 
      point-of-care PT, and TEG analysis with 4 activators (RapidTEG, 1 : 100 tissue 
      factor [TF100], 1 : 3700 tissue factor [TF3700], and kaolin), and results were 
      compared. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between ratios (peak 
      to baseline PT; peak reaction time [R] of TEG to baseline [R] of TEG) and anti-Xa 
      concentration. RESULTS: Anti-Xa concentration had a significant correlation with 
      point-of-care PT (R = 0.82, P < .001) and RapidTEG-TEG, TF100-TEG, and TF3700-TEG 
      (R = 0.76, P < .001; R = 0.82, P < .001; and R = 0.83, P < .001, respectively). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Overall, a 1.5-1.9 × delay in PT and R 
      values of TEG 3 hours after rivaroxaban administration is required to achieve 
      therapeutic anti-Xa concentrations of rivaroxaban in canine plasma. The R values 
      of TEG, specifically using tissue factors (RapidTEG, TF100, TF3700) and 
      point-of-care PT for rivaroxaban can be used practically for therapeutic 
      monitoring of rivaroxaban in dogs.

AB  - During recent years, three new anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban) have been introduced to the market, probably with one more 
      anticoagulant (edoxaban) in the next 2 years. This review is not intended to 
      compare the efficacy and risks of these new agents, but rather to detail the 
      advantages and limitations. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of these drugs 
      have few drug and food interactions, predictable dose responses, and rapid onset 
      and offset, thus resulting in simplified management of the patient requiring 
      anticoagulant therapy. No routine laboratory monitoring is required. A somewhat 
      unexpected, but exciting observation involving the new anticoagulants, is the 
      uniform reduction in intracranial bleeding by one-half compared with warfarin. 
      The potential limitations of the new anticoagulants include uncertainty regarding 
      assessment of drug levels, safe drug levels for major surgery, management of 
      major bleeding, renal dependence, multiple dose regimens, adherence in the 
      absence of frequent monitoring and unknown, rare side effects that were not 
      captured in the trials. This review should clarify some of these concerns.

AB  - Blockade of factor Xa becomes a routine part of clinical practice instead of 
      vitamin K blockade with warfarin, providing a more beneficial and safer effect. 
      The main indications are prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adults 
      with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary 
      embolism. Rivaroxaban has the largest number of data across high risk patients. 
      Rivaroxaban is an oral selective anti Xa inhibitor with well predictive 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. It inhibits thrombin formation for 24 
      hours, is well absorbed and biological availability is 80-100 %. The excretion is 
      mainly renal and the mean elimination time is 5-9 hours in younger and 11-13 
      hours in elderly. The pharmacokinetics is minimally influenced by sex and age. 
      The ROCKET AF trial has shown in 14 246 high-risk patients a trend to lowering 
      stroke and systemic embolization by rivaroxaban compared to warfarin without a 
      bleeding increase. The number of events per 100 patient-years was 1.71 in group 
      treated with rivaroxaban compared to 2.16 treated with warfarin (p < 0.001 for 
      non inferiority). A sub-analysis of the ROCKET AF trial has shown numerically 
      trend to higher efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in patients with moderate 
      renal insufficiency compared to warfarin. Mild hepatic impairment did not 
      significantly affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban, 
      compared with healthy subjects. The effects by age and concomitant diseases are 
      discussed. The X-VeRT trial shows a new indication for rivaroxaban - electric 
      cardioversion.Key words: age - anticoagulation - heart failure - high risk 
      patients - renal insufficiency - thromboembolic disease.

TI  - Minimal Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic and Drug-Drug-Disease Interaction 
      Model of Rivaroxaban and Verapamil in Healthy and Renally Impaired Subjects.
PG  - 541-548
LID - 10.1002/jcph.1044 [doi]
AB  - Current dosing recommendations for rivaroxaban advocate dosage reduction in 
      patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and avoidance of concomitant 
      strong inhibitors of CYP3A or P-glycoprotein. However, rivaroxaban dosing in 
      patients with mild renal impairment taking concomitant moderate inhibitors of 
      CYP3A and P-glycoprotein is not addressed. To quantify the impacts of concomitant 
      verapamil administration and renal impairment on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics, a 
      minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetic model system was developed and used 
      to evaluate potential increases in rivaroxaban exposure and the consequent 
      increase in risk of major bleeding. Data from a phase 1, drug-drug interaction 
      study were used to qualify the minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetic 
      model system. Model-based simulations indicate that coadministration of 
      rivaroxaban with verapamil substantially increases rivaroxaban exposure across 
      all renal function categories, resulting in an exponential increase in bleeding 
      risk. Reduction of the daily rivaroxaban dose to 10 to 15 mg reduces the major 
      bleeding risk below the designated 4.5% threshold in the majority of patients 
      with normal or mildly impaired renal function. A reduction to 10 mg daily in 
      patients with moderate to severe renal impairment provides additional risk 
      reduction so that 90% of those patients fall below the 4.5% threshold. A risk 
      threshold of 4.5% was selected because it is the median predicted risk in 
      patients treated concomitantly with ketoconazole, which is contraindicated for 
      use with rivaroxaban. Patients taking both rivaroxaban and verapamil should take 
      a reduced daily dose of rivaroxaban to minimize bleeding risk.

TI  - DOAC plasma levels measured by chromogenic anti-Xa assays and HPLC-UV in 
      apixaban- and rivaroxaban-treated patients from the START-Register.
PG  - 214-222
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.13159 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To measure direct factor Xa inhibitor (apixaban, edoxaban, 
      rivaroxaban) concentrations, dedicated chromogenic anti-Xa assays are recommended 
      as suitable methods to provide rapid drug quantification. Moreover, the 
      high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) is 
      reported as a reliable quantitative technique. We investigated seven anti-Xa 
      assays and an HPLC-UV method for measurement of apixaban and rivaroxaban levels 
      in patients enrolled in the START-Register. METHODS: A total of 127 apixaban and 
      124 rivaroxaban samples were tested by HPLC-UV and the following anti-Xa assays: 
      Biophen DiXaI and Heparin LRT (Hyphen BioMed), Berichrom and Innovance Heparin 
      (Siemens), STA-Liquid Anti-Xa (Stago Diagnostics), Technochrom anti-Xa 
      (Technoclone), and HemosIL Liquid Anti-Xa (Werfen). Each method was performed in 
      one of the participating laboratories: Bologna, Cremona, Florence, and Padua. 
      RESULTS: Our data confirmed the overestimation of apixaban and rivaroxaban levels 
      by the antithrombin-supplemented anti-Xa method (Berichrom). Performances and 
      reproducibility of the six anti-Xa assays not supplemented with antithrombin and 
      the HPLC-UV method were good, with limits of quantification from 8-39 ng/mL 
      (apixaban) and 15-33 ng/mL (rivaroxaban). The six chromogenic methods showed good 
      concordances with the quantitative HPLC-UV [bias: -26.9-22.3 ng/mL (apixaban), 
      -11.3-18.7 ng/mL (rivaroxaban)]. Higher bias and wider range between limits of 
      agreement were observed at higher concentrations [<100 ng/mL: bias 
      -21.3-4.1 ng/mL (apixaban) and -6.2-3.8 ng/mL (rivaroxaban); >200 ng/mL: bias 
      -42.2-36.8 ng/mL (apixaban) and -20.1-68.9 ng/mL (rivaroxaban)]. CONCLUSION: 
      Overall, the anti-Xa assays not supplemented with antithrombin and the HPLC-UV 
      method proved to be suitable for apixaban and rivaroxaban quantification.

AB  - Major orthopaedic surgery is associated with an increased risk of venous 
      thromboembolism. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are recommended as 
      thromboprophylactic agents after orthopaedic surgery. Although routine monitoring 
      of DOACs in general is not required, measuring DOAC concentration may be 
      necessary in clinical settings. The effects of DOACs on routine coagulation 
      assays in spiked material are studied extensively, however, few data are 
      available on DOAC concentration in patients after major orthopaedic surgery. We 
      measured trough and peak DOAC concentrations with UPLC-MS/MS and routine 
      coagulation tests in a prospective study including 40 patients receiving 
      thromboprophylactic treatment with dabigatran 220mg od and 40 patients receiving 
      rivaroxaban 10mg od after major orthopaedic surgery. For rivaroxaban, the median 
      trough concentration with UPLC-MS/MS was 17.1ng/mL and median peak concentration 
      was 149ng/mL. The anti-Xa assay displayed a good correlation, but a positive bias 
      in comparison to the reference method. Furthermore, trough levels were mostly 
      below the LOD of the anti-Xa assay. For dabigatran, the median trough 
      concentration with UPLC-MS/MS was 12.1ng/mL, and median peak level was 80.8ng/mL. 
      A positive bias was found when results from coagulation assays were compared to 
      UPLC-MS/MS data. However, the addition of glucuronidated metabolites to 
      dabigatran concentration UPLC-MS/MS data generally resolved most of this bias. 
      Age was found to have a significant influence on dabigatran pharmacokinetics, 
      irrespective of kidney function, whereas no effect of age was found during 
      rivaroxaban treatment. In both treatment groups, female subjects displayed faster 
      pharmacokinetics in comparison to male subjects, although not reaching 
      significance. We conclude that UPLC-MS/MS is the method of choice to measure 
      trough concentrations of DOACs in patients after orthopaedic surgery. Current 
      coagulation assays are not suited for this purpose. We found large heterogeneity 
      in both peak and trough concentrations of DOACs, and showed that pharmacokinetics 
      of novel oral anticoagulants may be influenced by age and gender. Whether 
      patients with high or low trough concentrations are at increased risk for 
      bleeding or thromboembolic events respectively remains to be established.

TI  - A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: 
      method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation.
PG  - 1203-1212
LID - 10.1111/bjh.17470 [doi]
AB  - A universal anti-Xa assay for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban drug concentrations would simplify laboratory procedures and facilitate 
      widespread implementation. Following two pilot studies analysing spiked samples 
      and material from 698 patients, we conducted a prospective multicentre 
      cross-sectional study, including 867 patients treated with rivaroxaban, apixaban 
      or edoxaban in clinical practice to comprehensively evaluate a simple, readily 
      available anti-Xa assay that would accurately measure drug concentrations and 
      correctly predict relevant levels in clinical practice. Anti-Xa activity was 
      measured by an assay calibrated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in 
      addition to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS). As an external validation, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity was also 
      determined in nine external laboratories. The LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity 
      correlated strongly with rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban drug levels [r(s) 
       = 0·98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·98-0·98]. The sensitivity for the 
      clinically relevant cut-off levels of 30, 50 and 100 µg/l was 96·2% (95% CI 
      94·4-97·4), 96·4% (95% CI 94·4-97·7) and 96·7% (95% CI 94·3-98·1) respectively. 
      Concordant results were obtained in the external validation study. In conclusion, 
      a universal, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assay accurately measured rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban and edoxaban concentrations and correctly predicted relevant drug 
      concentrations in clinical practice.

TI  - Rivaroxaban pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers evaluated with thrombin 
      generation and the active protein C system: Modeling and assessing 
      interindividual variability.
PG  - 1670-1682
LID - 10.1111/jth.14541 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor with substantial 
      inter-individual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability. Pharmacodynamic (PD) 
      variability, especially assessed with thrombin generation (TG), has been less 
      documented. OBJECTIVES: (i) To assess TG parameter time profiles in healthy 
      volunteers, with TG being studied under different conditions and (ii) to model 
      the relationship between rivaroxaban concentrations and TG parameters and 
      subsequently estimate interindividual variability. METHODS: Sixty healthy male 
      volunteers (DRIVING-NCT01627665) received a single 40-mg rivaroxaban dose. Blood 
      sampling was performed at baseline and 10 predefined time points over 24 h. The 
      TG was investigated with the fully automated ST-Genesia system (Stago), using two 
      tissue-factor (TF) concentrations, in the absence (-), or presence (+) of 
      thrombomodulin (TM) for the lowest one. The PD models were built to characterize 
      the relationships between plasma rivaroxaban concentrations and endogenous 
      thrombin potential (ETP) or peak height induced by the lowest TF concentration. 
      RESULTS: Thrombin generation parameter time profiles with the lowest TF 
      concentration showed a good sensitivity to rivaroxaban, especially +TM (active 
      protein C negative feedback). The relationship between rivaroxaban concentrations 
      and TG parameters was modeled with a sigmoidal relation. Mean rivaroxaban 
      concentrations halving the baseline value of ETP and peak height (-TM) (C(50) ) 
      were of 284 and 33.2 ng/mL, respectively: +TM, C(50) declined to 19.4 and 
      13.8 ng/mL, reflecting a powerful inhibitory effect. The estimated C(50) 
      population coefficients of variation were of 12.2% (-TM) and 31.3% (+TM) with the 
      peak height models, 34.8% (+TM) with the ETP model. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      low-rivaroxaban to moderate-rivaroxaban PD variability in healthy volunteers 
      contrasts with the substantial PK variability and deserves to be studied in 
      different patient settings.

PG  - 443-51
LID - 10.3949/ccjm.80a.13025 [doi]
AB  - The new oral anticoagulants dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban 
      (Xarelto), and apixaban (Eliquis) have predictable pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic profiles and are alternatives to warfarin. However, many 
      physicians are wary of these drugs, since there is limited evidence on how to 
      manage bleeding in patients taking them, and since no specific antidote is known 
      to reverse their anticoagulant effect. Management requires careful adherence to 
      first principles of bleeding care. Unapproved and untested reversal strategies 
      may be required in patients with life-threatening bleeding.

TI  - The Impact of Dexamethasone and Prednisone on Apixaban and Rivaroxaban Exposure 
      in COVID-19 Patients: A Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling Study.
PG  - 554-560
LID - 10.1002/cpt.3491 [doi]
AB  - Dexamethasone (DEX) is currently the treatment of choice for patients with 
      oxygen-dependent COVID-19. It has been observed, primarily in vitro, that 
      dexamethasone induces the expression of CYP3A and the ABCB1 gene, which encodes 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp). This has raised concerns about potential interactions 
      between DEX and substrates of CYP3A and P-gp, such as direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOAC). Currently, there is limited robust evidence to support a clinically 
      significant interaction between DEX and DOAC. Using physiologically based 
      pharmacokinetic modeling (PBPK), we investigated the impact of DEX administered 
      in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban (APX) 
      and rivaroxaban (RVX). After validating the induction effect of the DEX compound 
      on two CYP3A4 substrates using the limited available studies, we optimized the 
      compound in a COVID-19 patient population, where significantly higher DEX plasma 
      concentrations were observed compared to healthy volunteers. Our PBPK-based PK 
      simulations showed a 20% decrease in the AUC of APX and RVX in a worst-case 
      scenario and when DEX was administered at 6 mg PO for 10 days. This finding 
      confirms the limited clinical data currently available and supports the use of 
      APX and RVX with DEX in COVID-19 patients at low-risk for thrombo-embolism. In 
      addition, our results suggest that prednisone (PRED), when used at an equipotent 
      dose, could serve as a viable alternative to DEX, given its less pronounced 
      induction effect on APX and RVX. Further research is needed to validate these 
      findings and to explore the clinical implications of using PRED in place of DEX 
      in such scenarios.

TI  - Chromogenic anti-FXa assay calibrated with low molecular weight heparin in 
      patients treated with rivaroxaban and apixaban: possibilities and limitations.
PG  - 010702
LID - 10.11613/BM.2020.010702 [doi]
LID - 010702
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Clinical application of rivaroxaban and apixaban does not require 
      therapeutic monitoring. Commercial anti-activated factor X (anti-FXa) inhibition 
      methods for all anti-FXa drugs are based on the same principle, so there are 
      attempts to evaluate potential clinical application of heparin-calibrated 
      anti-FXa assay as an alternative method for direct FXa inhibitors. We aimed to 
      evaluate relationship between anti-FXa methods calibrated with low molecular 
      weight heparin (LMWH) and with drug specific calibrators, and to determine 
      whether commercial LMWH anti-FXa assay can be used to exclude the presence of 
      clinically relevant concentrations of rivaroxaban and apixaban. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Low molecular weight heparin calibrated reagent (Siemens Healthineers, 
      Marburg, Germany) was used for anti-FXa activity measurement. Innovance heparin 
      (Siemens Healthineers, Marburg, Germany) calibrated with rivaroxaban and apixaban 
      calibrators (Hyphen BioMed, Neuville-sur-Oise, France) was used for quantitative 
      determination of FXa inhibitors. RESULTS: Analysis showed good agreement between 
      LMWH calibrated and rivaroxaban calibrated activity (κ = 0.76) and very good 
      agreement with apixaban calibrated anti-Xa activity (κ = 0.82), respectively. Low 
      molecular weight heparin anti-FXa activity cut-off values of 0.05 IU/mL and 0.1 
      IU/mL are suitable for excluding the presence of clinically relevant 
      concentrations (< 30 ng/mL) of rivaroxaban and apixaban, respectively. 
      Concentrations above 300 ng/mL exceeded upper measurement range for LMWH anti-FXa 
      assay and cannot be determined by this method. CONCLUSION: Low molecular weight 
      heparin anti-FXa assay can be used in emergency clinical conditions for ruling 
      out the presence of clinically relevant concentrations of rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban. However, use of LMWH anti-FXa assay is not appropriate for their 
      quantitative determination as an interchangeable method.

TI  - Assessment of DOAC in GEriatrics (Adage Study): Rivaroxaban/Apixaban 
      Concentrations and Thrombin Generation Profiles in NVAF Very Elderly Patients.
PG  - 402-414
LID - 10.1055/a-1981-1763 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND:  Although a growing number of very elderly patients with atrial 
      fibrillation (AF), multiple conditions, and polypharmacy receive direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs), few studies specifically investigated both 
      apixaban/rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in such patients. 
      AIMS:  To investigate: (1) DOAC concentration-time profiles; (2) thrombin 
      generation (TG); and (3) clinical outcomes 6 months after inclusion in very 
      elderly AF in-patients receiving rivaroxaban or apixaban. METHODS: 
       Adage-NCT02464488 was an academic prospective exploratory multicenter study, 
      enrolling AF in-patients aged ≥80 years, receiving DOAC for at least 4 days. Each 
      patient had one to five blood samples at different time points over 20 days. DOAC 
      concentrations were determined using chromogenic assays. TG was investigated 
      using ST-Genesia (STG-ThromboScreen, STG-DrugScreen). RESULTS:  We included 215 
      patients (women 71.1%, mean age: 87 ± 4 years), 104 rivaroxaban and 111 apixaban, 
      and 79.5% receiving reduced-dose regimen. We observed important inter-individual 
      variabilities (coefficient of variation) whatever the regimen, at C (max) 
      [49-46%] and C (min) [75-61%] in 15 mg rivaroxaban and 2.5 mg apixaban patients, 
      respectively. The dose regimen was associated with C (max) and C (min) plasma 
      concentrations in apixaban (p = 0.0058 and p = 0.0222, respectively), but not in 
      rivaroxaban samples (multivariate analysis). Moreover, substantial variability of 
      thrombin peak height (STG-ThromboScreen) was noticed at a given plasma 
      concentration for both xabans, suggesting an impact of the underlying coagulation 
      status on TG in elderly in-patients. After 6-month follow-up, major 
      bleeding/thromboembolic event/death rates were 6.7%/1.0%/17.3% in rivaroxaban and 
      5.4%/3.6%/18.9% in apixaban patients, respectively. CONCLUSION:  Our study 
      provides original data in very elderly patients receiving DOAC in a real-life 
      setting, showing great inter-individual variability in plasma concentrations and 
      TG parameters. Further research is needed to understand the potential clinical 
      impact of these findings.

TI  - Determination of rivaroxaban in rat plasma by ultra-high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-Q-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry and its application 
      to a pharmacokinetic study.

AB  - Therapeutic drug monitoring is critical to decrease the incidence rate of 
      bleeding and thrombosis for personalized treatment with rivaroxaban, especially 
      for drug interaction treatment, patients with renal dysfunction, elderly 
      patients, patients with cardiovascular problems, and so on. In addition, an 
      accurate analytical method is necessary for therapeutic drug monitoring. This 
      study developed a ultra-HPLC-tandem Orbitrap high-resolution MS (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap 
      HRMS) method to accurately identify and quantify rivaroxaban in rat plasma. The 
      isotope internal standard method was applied for accurate quantification. 
      Rivaroxaban-d(4) was selected as the isotope internal standard substance. The m/z 
      436.07263 ([M + H](+) ) was selected as the precursor ion and m/z 144.95085 and 
      m/z 231.11259 were selected as the main product ions for rivaroxaban. The lower 
      limit of quantification of rivaroxaban in plasma was 0.01 mg/L. The intra- and 
      inter-day precisions were ≤3.65% and ≤8.16%, while the recoveries ranged from 
      87.4% to 95.2%. This analysis method was simple, low cost, and easy to operate. 
      The developed and validated method was subsequently applied to successfully 
      investigate the pharmacokinetic parameters of rivaroxaban in rats after its oral 
      administration. These results could be helpful to promote further research 
      regarding the mechanisms of rivaroxaban and drug interaction, which can avoid 
      false positives due to high-precision identification of the proposed method.

TI  - Preliminary report: Measurement of apixaban and rivaroxaban in plasma from 
      bleeding patients.
PG  - 431-436
LID - 10.1111/ejh.12942 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), apixaban and rivaroxaban, are 
      used for anticoagulation treatment. Although biochemical monitoring is not 
      required, severe bleedings caused by DOAC have been reported. We therefore 
      evaluated the chromogenic assay Biophen DiXaI(®) (Biophen) using plasma from 
      non-bleeding patients in treatment with DOAC and on spiked plasma from patients 
      with ongoing bleeding. METHODS: The Biophen method was compared with an in-house 
      reference method; liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using 
      plasma spiked with the compounds ranging from 20 to 1500 μg/L. Furthermore, the 
      methods were compared using plasma from non-bleeding patients in treatment with 
      DOAC (n = 106). In addition, plasma was collected from patients not treated with 
      DOAC, but with ongoing bleeding and tested in spiking experiments (n = 14). 
      RESULTS: Analysis of plasma from 106 patients receiving rivaroxaban (n = 91) or 
      apixaban (n = 15) showed agreement and correlation between the methods. 
      Measurement in spiked plasma from patients with active bleeding, however, 
      revealed a 26% overestimation by the assay. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that 
      Biophen is suitable for measuring apixaban and rivaroxaban concentrations in 
      plasma. However, our results in patients with active bleeding show an 
      overestimation of 26%. This should be taken into account when assessing possible 
      intoxication with apixaban and rivaroxaban in patients presenting with bleeding.

TI  - Enhanced Oral Bioavailability of Rivaroxaban-Loaded Microspheres by Optimizing 
      the Polymer and Surfactant Based on Molecular Interaction Mechanisms.
PG  - 4153-4164
LID - 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.3c00281 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to develop microspheres using water-soluble carriers and 
      surfactants to improve the solubility, dissolution, and oral bioavailability of 
      rivaroxaban (RXB). RXB-loaded microspheres with optimal carrier 
      (poly(vinylpyrrolidone) K30, PVP) and surfactant (sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)) 
      ratios were prepared. (1)H NMR and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses 
      showed that drug-excipient and excipient-excipient interactions affected RXB 
      solubility, dissolution, and oral absorption. Therefore, molecular interactions 
      between RXB, PVP, and SLS played an important role in improving RXB solubility, 
      dissolution, and oral bioavailability. Formulations IV and VIII, containing 
      optimized RXB/PVP/SLS ratios (1:0.25:2 and 1:1:2, w/w/w), had significantly 
      improved solubility by approximately 160- and 86-fold, respectively, compared to 
      RXB powder, with the final dissolution rates improved by approximately 4.5- and 
      3.4-fold, respectively, compared to those of RXB powder at 120 min. Moreover, the 
      oral bioavailability of RXB was improved by 2.4- and 1.7-fold, respectively, 
      compared to that of RXB powder. Formulation IV showed the highest improvement in 
      oral bioavailability compared to RXB powder (AUC, 2400.8 ± 237.1 vs 1002.0 ± 82.3 
      h·ng/mL). Finally, the microspheres developed in this study successfully improved 
      the solubility, dissolution rate, and bioavailability of RXB, suggesting that 
      formulation optimization with the optimal drug-to-excipient ratio can lead to 
      successful formulation development.

TI  - Development of a paediatric population-based model of the pharmacokinetics of 
      rivaroxaban.
PG  - 89-102
LID - 10.1007/s40262-013-0090-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism has been increasingly recognised as a clinical 
      problem in the paediatric population. Guideline recommendations for 
      antithrombotic therapy in paediatric patients are based mainly on extrapolation 
      from adult clinical trial data, owing to the limited number of clinical trials in 
      paediatric populations. The oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban has been 
      approved in adult patients for several thromboembolic disorders, and its 
      well-defined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics and efficacy and 
      safety profiles in adults warrant further investigation of this agent in the 
      paediatric population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop and 
      qualify a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for rivaroxaban 
      doses of 10 and 20 mg in adults and to scale this model to the paediatric 
      population (0-18 years) to inform the dosing regimen for a clinical study of 
      rivaroxaban in paediatric patients. METHODS: Experimental data sets from phase I 
      studies supported the development and qualification of an adult PBPK model. This 
      adult PBPK model was then scaled to the paediatric population by including 
      anthropometric and physiological information, age-dependent clearance and 
      age-dependent protein binding. The pharmacokinetic properties of rivaroxaban in 
      virtual populations of children were simulated for two body weight-related dosing 
      regimens equivalent to 10 and 20 mg once daily in adults. The quality of the 
      model was judged by means of a visual predictive check. Subsequently, paediatric 
      simulations of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), maximum 
      (peak) plasma drug concentration (C max) and concentration in plasma after 24 h 
      (C 24h) were compared with the adult reference simulations. RESULTS: Simulations 
      for AUC, C max and C 24h throughout the investigated age range largely overlapped 
      with values obtained for the corresponding dose in the adult reference simulation 
      for both body weight-related dosing regimens. However, pharmacokinetic values in 
      infants and preschool children (body weight <40 kg) were lower than the 90 % 
      confidence interval threshold of the adult reference model and, therefore, 
      indicated that doses in these groups may need to be increased to achieve the same 
      plasma levels as in adults. For children with body weight between 40 and 70 kg, 
      simulated plasma pharmacokinetic parameters (C max, C 24h and AUC) overlapped 
      with the values obtained in the corresponding adult reference simulation, 
      indicating that body weight-related exposure was similar between these children 
      and adults. In adolescents of >70 kg body weight, the simulated 90 % prediction 
      interval values of AUC and C 24h were much higher than the 90 % confidence 
      interval of the adult reference population, owing to the weight-based simulation 
      approach, but for these patients rivaroxaban would be administered at adult fixed 
      doses of 10 and 20 mg. CONCLUSION: The paediatric PBPK model developed here 
      allowed an exploratory analysis of the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in 
      children to inform the dosing regimen for a clinical study in paediatric 
      patients.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is a novel, oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor for the prevention and 
      treatment of thromboembolic disorders. The objective of this study was to 
      investigate the in vivo metabolism and excretion of rivaroxaban in rats, dogs, 
      and humans. Single doses of [(14)C]rivaroxaban (3 and 1 mg/kg) were administered 
      to rats (orally/intravenously) and dogs (orally), respectively. A single oral 
      dose of [(14)C]rivaroxaban (10 mg) was administered to healthy human males (n = 
      4). Plasma and excreta were collected and profiled for radioactivity. Recovery of 
      total radioactivity was high and > or = 92% in all species. Unchanged rivaroxaban 
      was the major compound in plasma at all time points investigated, across all 
      species. No major or pharmacologically active circulating metabolites were 
      detected. Rivaroxaban and its metabolites were rapidly excreted; urinary 
      excretion of radioactivity was 25 and 52%, and fecal excretion was 67 and 43% of 
      the dose in rats and dogs, respectively. In humans, 66% of the dose was excreted 
      renally (36% unchanged drug) and 28% in the feces. Radioactivity profiles in 
      excreta were similar across species. Three metabolic pathways were identified: 
      oxidative degradation of the morpholinone moiety (major pathway) and hydrolysis 
      of the central amide bond and of the lactam amide bond in the morpholinone ring 
      (minor pathways). M-1, the main metabolite in excreta of all species, was 
      eliminated via both renal and fecal/biliary routes. In total, 82 to 89% of the 
      dose administered was assigned to unchanged rivaroxaban and its metabolites in 
      the excreta of rats, dogs, and humans.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) is one of the major concerns for the 
      clinical use of NOACs in the older adults considering that coexistence of 
      multiple diseases and comorbidity were common. Current guidelines on the DDI 
      management were established based on clinical studies conducted in healthy adults 
      and mainly focus on the Caucasians, whereas systemic and ethnic differences may 
      lead to distinct management in the Chinese older adults. OBJECTIVES: To 
      investigate the impact of aging on the DDI magnitude between P-gp and/or CYP3A4 
      inhibitors with dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban in older adults, providing 
      additional information for the use in clinical practice. RESULTS: Compared with 
      the simulated adult, the AUC of the simulated older adults increased by 42-88% 
      (DABE) and 21-60% (rivaroxaban), respectively, during NOACs monotherapy. 
      Simulation on DDIs predicted that verapamil and clarithromycin further increase 
      the exposure of dabigatran by 29-72% and 40-47%, whereas clarithromycin, 
      fluconazole, and ketoconazole increase the exposure of rivaroxaban by 21-30%, 
      16-24%, and 194-247% in the older adults. Overall, our simulation result 
      demonstrated that aging and DDIs both increased the exposure of NOACs. However, 
      aging does not have a drastic impact on the extent of DDIs. The DDI ratios of 
      young and old older adults were similar to the adults and were also similar 
      between Caucasians and Chinese. DISCUSSION: We further simulated the interactions 
      under steady-state based on the EHRA guideline (2021). Our simulation results 
      revealed that recommended reduced dosing regimen of dabigatran etexilate during 
      comedication with verapamil and clarithromycin (110 and 75 mg BID for Chinese 
      young and old older adults) will result in exposure (trough concentration) that 
      was either slightly higher or similar to the trough concentration of patients 
      with any bleeding events. Routine monitoring of bleeding risk is encouraged. 
      Further studies on the use of rivaroxaban in Chinese older adults are warranted. 
      CONCLUSION: Aging and DDI increases exposure of drug in Chinese older adults. 
      However, aging does not have a drastic impact on the extent of DDIs. Clinical 
      management of DDIs in Chinese older adults in the absence of complex polypharmacy 
      can a priori be similar to the EHRA guideline but routine monitoring of bleeding 
      risk is encouraged when dabigatran etexilate given with verapamil and 
      clarithromycin.

TI  - Clinical outcomes and plasma clot permeability and lysability in patients with 
      venous thromboembolism on rivaroxaban: a cohort study.
PG  - 377-385
LID - 10.20452/pamw.14824 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Denser fibrin structure and impaired fibrinolysis reported in 
      patients following venous thromboembolism (VTE) can predict recurrent VTE after 
      cessation of anticoagulation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate 
      whether the properties of fibrin clot may be useful in predicting adverse events 
      in patients with VTE receiving rivaroxaban. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 132 patients 
      with VTE treated with rivaroxaban for 8 weeks or longer, we determined plasma 
      clot permeability (Ks) and clot lysis time (CLT) in blood samples collected 2 to 
      28 hours after rivaroxaban intake (20 mg/d). The primary endpoint was a composite 
      of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, while the secondary endpoint 
      was recurrent symptomatic VTE. RESULTS: During a median follow‑ up of 32 months, 
      the annual rates of primary and secondary endpoints were 3.6% and 2.7%, 
      respectively. There were no differences in Ks and CLT between individuals who 
      experienced the primary endpoint and the remainder. Patients with recurrent VTE 
      had lower baseline Ks (-26.7%) and prolonged CLT (+20.8%) on rivaroxaban, without 
      differences in rivaroxaban concentrations at the time of blood collection. After 
      adjustment for confounding factors, Ks was the only predictor of VTE recurrence 
      on rivaroxaban (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06-0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      suggests that Ks assessed on rivaroxaban may provide prognostic information about 
      the risk of recurrent VTE in anticoagulated patients.

TI  - Clinical development of rivaroxaban: emerging new clinical evidences?
PG  - 565-83
LID - 10.2217/fca.15.31 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban has proven efficacious in a variety of conditions. In fact, 
      rivaroxaban has been approved for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after 
      elective hip or knee replacement surgery, for the prevention and treatment of 
      deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, for the prevention of stroke in 
      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and for the prevention of 
      atherothrombotic events after acute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac 
      biomarkers. However, clinical development of rivaroxaban is ongoing. Considering 
      published and on-going randomized clinical trials, noninterventional studies and 
      registries, over 275,000 patients are being analyzed. The aim of this review was 
      to update the clinical development of rivaroxaban, including completed and 
      ongoing studies not only randomized clinical trials, but also clinical practice 
      studies.

TI  - Simultaneous determination of Rivaroxaban and TAK-438 in rat plasma by LC-MS/MS: 
      application to pharmacokinetic interaction study.
PG  - 11-22
LID - 10.4155/bio-2019-0130 [doi]
AB  - Aim: A sensitive and reliable LC-MS/MS method has been established and validated 
      to the quantitation of rivaroxaban (RIV) and TAK-438 in rat plasma using 
      carbamazepine as internal standard. Results: The procedure of method validation 
      was conducted according to the guidelines of EMA and US FDA. At the same time, 
      the method was applied to pharmacokinetic interactions study between RIV and 
      TAK-438 for the first time. When RIV and TAK-438 co-administration to rats, main 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of TAK-438 like AUC((0-t)), AUC((0-∞)) and C(max) had 
      statistically significant increase. The main pharmacokinetic parameters of RIV 
      have no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) when co-administered 
      except for t(1/2) (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The results indicated that drug-drug 
      interactions occurred between RIV and TAK-438 when co-administered to rats.

LID - 10.1007/s10856-018-6194-6 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban (RIV) is an oral anticoagulant used in the prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism in adult patients after total hip replacement or total knee 
      replacement surgery. It is practically insoluble in water and buffer systems (pH 
      3-9). The present study was aimed to investigate the β-CD-based inclusion 
      complexes and nanocomposites of rivaroxaban (RIV) for solubility and dissolution 
      enhancement. A novel solubility enhancement approach of inclusion complexation of 
      RIV with β-CD using spray drying method combined with high pressure 
      homogenization as a particle engineering method was used. Change in crystallinity 
      of RIV nanocomposites was assessed by DSC and PXRD. The interaction of drug with 
      β-CD was projected through (1)H-NMR and FT-IR studies. Saturation solubility and 
      in vitro dissolution study revealed a dramatic increase in solubility and 
      dissolution of RIV, respectively. Thus, spray-dried β-CD-based nanocomposites 
      could be an innovative approach for solubility and dissolution enhancement of 
      RIV.

AB  - The new direct oral anticoagulants-dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and 
      apixaban- have predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and are 
      alternatives to warfarin. However, many surgeons are wary of these drugs, as 
      there is limited evidence on how to manage bleeding in patients taking them, and 
      only recently has a specific antidote been developed to reverse their 
      anticoagulant effect. Management of the newer agents requires careful adherence 
      to primary measures of bleeding care, knowledge of their mechanism of action, and 
      familiarity with the unapproved and untested reversal strategies that may be 
      required in patients with life-threatening bleeding.

TI  - Absence of interaction between rivaroxaban, tacrolimus and everolimus in renal

AB  - No data are available on rivaroxaban use in renal transplant recipients and on 
      its surmised interaction with immunosuppressants. The aim was to investigate 
      potential interactions between rivaroxaban and immunosuppressants in this 
      setting. Renal transplant recipients with a stable renal function treated with 
      rivaroxaban and tacrolimus with or without everolimus were investigated. All 
      drugs and creatinine concentrations were determined daily for 2 weeks after the 
      start of anticoagulation. Blood samples were drawn at 8.00 am and 3-4 h later for 
      trough and peak concentrations, respectively. Bleeding and thrombotic events were 
      recorded during a minimum follow-up of 6 months. In 8 renal transplant patients, 
      rivaroxaban levels showed a predictable pharmacokinetic trend, both at C(trough) 
      (30-61 μg/L) and at C(peak) (143-449 μg/L), with limited variability in the 
      25th-75th percentile range. Tacrolimus (C(trough) 3-13 μg/L; C(peak) 3-16 μg/L), 
      everolimus (C(trough) 3-11 μg/L; C(peak) 5-17 μg/L) and creatinine concentrations 
      were stable as well. Immunosuppressors variability before and after rivaroxaban 
      were 30% and 30% for tacrolimus, 27% and 29% for everolimus, respectively, as 
      well as 14% and 3% for creatinine. For rivaroxaban monitoring, the reference 
      change value better performed in identifying significant variations of its 
      concentration. No patient had bleeding or thrombotic events, worsening of renal 
      graft function, and signs of immunosuppressants toxicity during a mean follow-up 
      of 23 (9-28) months. In conclusion, rivaroxaban does not seem to interact with 
      tacrolimus and everolimus in renal transplant recipients. Both anticoagulant and 
      immunosuppressive effects seem warranted, without major bleeding complications 
      and effect on the graft function.

TI  - Simvastatin, but Not Atorvastatin, Is Associated with Higher Peak Rivaroxaban 
      Serum Levels and Bleeding: an Asian Cohort Study from Singapore.
PG  - 917-925
LID - 10.1007/s10557-022-07346-8 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study attempts to identify predictors associated with bleeding and 
      stroke and systemic embolism (SSE) in Singaporean Asians taking rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban. METHODS: A total of 134 Singaporean patients on either rivaroxaban or 
      apixaban for non-valvular atrial fibrillation were included for this study. 
      Baseline characteristics were recorded at recruitment while bleeding and SSE 
      events were recorded during a 1-year follow-up. Peak and trough drug plasma 
      concentrations were collected based on the dosing interval and pharmacokinetics 
      of the drugs and quantified using high performance liquid chromatography. 
      Characteristics of patients with or without bleeds were compared using relevant 
      statistical tests. Multivariable regression that included covariates with p < 0.1 
      from an initial univariable regression was performed to analyse predictors that 
      resulted in higher risk of bleeding in patients. RESULTS: Median creatinine 
      clearance (CrCl) was significantly lower in patients on rivaroxaban who 
      experienced bleeds as compared to patients who did not experience bleeds (61.5 vs 
      70.8 mL/min, p = 0.047), while concomitant simvastatin use was found to be 
      independently associated with a sixfold increased risk of bleeding (adjusted OR = 
      6.14 (95% CI: 1.18-31.97), p = 0.031) for rivaroxaban after controlling for body 
      mass index, CrCl and having experienced a previous SSE. CONCLUSION: Our findings 
      suggest that concomitant use of simvastatin with rivaroxaban may be associated 
      with bleeding events in an Asian cohort. Further studies using physiologically 
      based pharmacokinetic modelling are required to investigate the drug-drug 
      interactions between these drugs.

TI  - Racial and Ethnic Differences in Response to Anticoagulation: A Review of the 
      Literature.
PG  - 685-693
LID - 10.1177/0897190019894142 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anticoagulants are among the most frequently prescribed medications 
      in the United States. Racial and ethnic disparities in incidence and outcomes of 
      thrombotic disorders are well-documented, but differences in response to 
      anticoagulation are incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this 
      review is to describe the impact of race and ethnicity on surrogate and clinical 
      end points related to anticoagulation and discuss racial or ethnic considerations 
      for prescribing anticoagulants. METHODS: A PubMed and MEDLINE search of clinical 
      trials published between 1950 and May 2018 was conducted using search terms 
      related to anticoagulation, specific anticoagulant drugs, race, and ethnicity. 
      References of identified studies were also reviewed. English-language human 
      studies on safety or efficacy of anticoagulants reporting data for different 
      races or ethnicities were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: Seventeen relevant 
      studies were identified. The majority of major trials reviewed for inclusion 
      either did not include representative populations or did not report on the racial 
      breakdown of participants. Racial differences in pharmacokinetics, dosing 
      requirements, drug response, and/or safety end points were identified for 
      unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, argatroban, warfarin, rivaroxaban, and 
      edoxaban. CONCLUSIONS: Race appears to influence drug concentrations, dosing, or 
      safety for some but not all direct oral anticoagulants. This information should 
      be considered when selecting anticoagulant therapy for nonwhite individuals.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the interactions of 3 anticoagulants, 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran, with 5 human solute carrier transporters, 
      hOAT1, hOAT3, hOCT2, hOATP1B1, and hOATP1B3. Apixaban inhibited hOAT3, hOATP1B1, 
      and hOATP1B3, and rivaroxaban inhibited hOAT3 and hOATP1B3, with IC(50) values of 
      >20 and >5 μM, respectively. The effect of dabigatran was negligible or very 
      weak, so significant drug interactions at therapeutic doses are unlikely. 
      Specific uptake of rivaroxaban was observed only in human and mouse 
      OAT3-expressing cells. The K(m) for mouse Oat3 (mOat3) was 1.01 ± 0.70 μM. A 
      defect in mOat3 reduced the kidney-to-plasma concentration ratio of rivaroxaban 
      by 38% in mice. Probenecid treatment also reduced the kidney-to-plasma 
      concentration ratio of rivaroxaban in rats by 73%. Neither mOat3 defect nor 
      probenecid administration in rats reduced the renal clearance of rivaroxaban. The 
      uptake of rivaroxaban by monkey kidney slices was temperature dependent and 
      inhibited by probenecid but not by tetraethylammonium. Taken together, organic 
      anion transporters, mainly OAT3, may mediate basolateral uptake of rivaroxaban in 
      kidneys. hOAT3 could be an additional factor that differentiates the potential 
      drug-drug interactions of the 3 anticoagulants in the urinary excretion process 
      in clinical settings.

TI  - Identification of Infigratinib as a Potent Reversible Inhibitor and 
      Mechanism-Based Inactivator of CYP2J2: Nascent Evidence for a Potential In Vivo 
      Metabolic Drug-Drug Interaction with Rivaroxaban.
PG  - 123-134
LID - 10.1124/jpet.122.001222 [doi]
AB  - Infigratinib (INF) is a fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor that was 
      recently United States Food and Drug Administration-approved for the treatment of 
      advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. We previously established that INF 
      inhibited and inactivated cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Here, in a follow up to 
      our previous study, we identified for the first time that INF also elicited 
      potent competitive inhibition and mechanism-based inactivation of CYP2J2 with 
      kinetic parameters K (i), K (I), k (inact), and a partition ratio of 1.94 µM, 
      0.10 µM, 0.026 minute(-1), and ∼3, respectively, when rivaroxaban was harnessed 
      as the probe substrate. Inactivation was revealed to exhibit cofactor-dependency 
      and was attenuated by an alternative substrate (astemizole) and direct inhibitor 
      (nilotinib) of CYP2J2. Additionally, the nature of inactivation was unlikely to 
      be pseudo-irreversible and instead arose from covalent modification due to the 
      lack of substantial enzyme activity recovery after dialysis and chemical 
      oxidation, as well as the lack of a resolvable Soret band in spectral scans. 
      Glutathione trapping confirmed that the identity of the putative reactive 
      intermediate implicated in the covalent inactivation of both CYP2J2 and CYP3A4 
      was identical and likely attributable to an electrophilic p-benzoquinonediimine 
      intermediate of INF. Finally, mechanistic static modeling revealed that by 
      integrating the previously arcane inhibition and inactivation kinetic parameters 
      of CYP2J2-mediated rivaroxaban hydroxylation by INF illuminated in this work, 
      together with those previously documented for CYP3A4, a 49% increase in the 
      systemic exposure of rivaroxaban was projected. Our modeling results predicted a 
      potential risk of metabolic drug-drug interactions between the clinically 
      relevant combination of rivaroxaban and INF in the setting of cancer. 
      SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study reported that INF elicits potent reversible 
      inhibition and mechanism-based inactivation of CYP2J2. Furthermore, static 
      modelling predicted that its coadministration with the direct oral anticoagulant 
      rivaroxaban may potentially culminate in a metabolic drug-drug interaction (DDI) 
      leading to an increased risk of major bleeding. As rivaroxaban is steadily 
      gaining prominence as the anticoagulant of choice in the treatment of 
      cancer-associated venous thromboembolism, the DDI projections reported here are 
      clinically relevant and warrant further investigation via physiologically based 
      pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation.

TI  - Role of rivaroxaban in the management of atrial fibrillation: insights from 
      clinical practice.
PG  - 13-21
LID - 10.2147/VHRM.S134394 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and it 
      leads to significant morbidity and mortality, predominantly from ischemic stroke. 
      Vitamin K antagonists, mainly warfarin, have been used for decades to prevent 
      ischemic stroke in AF, but their use is limited due to interactions with food and 
      other drugs, as well as the requirement for regular monitoring of the 
      international normalized ratio. Rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor and the 
      most commonly used non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant, avoids many of these 
      challenges and is being prescribed with increasing frequency for stroke 
      prevention in non-valvular AF. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) data from the 
      ROCKET-AF(Rivaroxaban once daily oral direct Factor Xa inhibition compared with 
      vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and embolism trial in atrial 
      fibrillation) trial have shown rivaroxaban to be non-inferior to warfarin in 
      preventing ischemic stroke and systemic embolism and to have comparable overall 
      bleeding rates. Applicability of the RCT data to real-world practice can 
      sometimes be limited by complex clinical scenarios or multiple comorbidities not 
      adequately represented in the trials. Available real-world evidence in 
      non-valvular AF patients with comorbidities - including renal impairment, acute 
      coronary syndrome, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, or old age - supports the use 
      of rivaroxaban as safe and effective in preventing ischemic stroke in these 
      subgroups, though with some important considerations required to reduce bleeding 
      risk. Patient perspectives on rivaroxaban use are also considered. Real-world 
      evidence indicates superior rates of drug adherence with rivaroxaban when 
      compared with vitamin K antagonists and with alternative non-vitamin K oral 
      anticoagulants - perhaps, in part, due to its once-daily dosing regimen. 
      Furthermore, self-reported quality of life scores are highest among patients 
      compliant with rivaroxaban therapy. The generally high levels of patient 
      satisfaction with rivaroxaban therapy contribute to overall favorable clinical 
      outcomes.

TI  - The use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in dialysis patients-A systematic 
      review.
PG  - 463-480
LID - 10.1111/sdi.13098 [doi]
AB  - Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are used for prevention of 
      thromboembolic events, but their use in dialysis patients is debatable. This 
      study investigated the available evidence for the use of NOACs in dialysis 
      patients. Online databases were systematically searched for eligible studies 
      including pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, cohort studies, and randomized control 
      trials (RCTs) comparing NOAC with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or no anticoagulant 
      treatment. Newcastle Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of bias tool were used for 
      quality assessment. Twenty studies were identified (nine PK studies, two RCTs, 
      and nine cohort studies). Most of the studies investigated apixaban or 
      rivaroxaban. In dialysis patients, less accumulation was reported with apixaban 
      and rivaroxaban compared to dabigatran and edoxaban. PK studies indicate that 
      high dose apixaban or rivaroxaban should be avoided. The two RCTs 
      (rivaroxaban/apixaban vs. VKA) were small and underpowered regarding stroke and 
      bleeding outcomes. Most cohort studies found apixaban superior to VKA, whereas 
      comparison of rivaroxaban with VKA yielded conflicting results. Cohort studies 
      comparing apixaban high dose (5 mg) with low dose (2.5 mg) twice daily suggest a 
      lower risk of stroke with high dose but also a higher risk of bleeding with high 
      dose. Apixaban versus no anticoagulation was compared in one cohort study and did 
      not lower the risk of stroke compared with non-treated regardless of apixaban 
      dosage. Widespread use of NOACs in dialysis patients is limited by adequately 
      sized RCTs. Available evidence suggests a potential for use of apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban in reduced dose.

TI  - A Cross-Study Analysis Evaluating the Effects of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of 
      Rivaroxaban in Clinical Studies.
PG  - 1607-1615

AB  - US prescribing guidelines recommend that 15- and 20-mg doses of rivaroxaban be 
      administered with food for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 
      pulmonary embolism (PE) and for reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and 
      PE. In addition, the US prescribing guidelines recommend these doses be 
      administered with an evening meal to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic 
      embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). The purpose of 
      this model-based cross-study comparison was to examine the impact of food, with 
      regard to both meal timing and content, on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      rivaroxaban, using data collected during its clinical development. Results of 
      this analysis showed that a PK model built from pooled data in the AF population 
      (for whom rivaroxaban was administered with an evening meal) and in the DVT 
      population (for whom rivaroxaban was administered with a morning meal) can 
      describe both data sets well. Furthermore, the PK model built from data in the AF 
      population alone can adequately predict the PK profile of the DVT population and 
      vice versa. This cross-study analysis also confirmed the findings from previous 
      clinical pharmacology studies, which showed that meal content does not have a 
      clinically relevant impact on the PK of rivaroxaban at 20 mg. Therefore, although 
      the administration of rivaroxaban with food is necessary for maintaining high 
      bioavailability, neither meal timing nor meal content appears to affect the PK of 
      rivaroxaban.

AB  - The purpose of the currents study was to enhance bioavailability of rivaroxaban 
      (RXB) and reduce the food effect. RXB loaded PLGA nanoparticles (RXB-PLGA-NPs) 
      were prepared by emulsion solvent evaporation method and optimized using central 
      composite design (CDD). The optimized RXB-PLGA-NPs (F8) with composition, PLGA 
      (125 mg), PVA (0.5%w/w) and RXB (20 mg) was found optimum with particle size 
      (496 ± 8.5 nm), PDI (0.607), ZP (- 18.41 ± 3.14 mV), %EE (87.9 ± 8.6) and %DL 
      (9.5 ± 1.6). The optimized NPs (F8) was further evaluated in vitro for DSC, FTIR, 
      SEM and in vitro release studies. A comparative pharmacokinetic studies with 
      commercial tablet (XARELTO®) were conducted on fasted and fed state rats. 
      Compared to commercial tablet (XARELTO®), the RXB-PLGA-NPs (F8) exhibited a 
      significant enhancement of bioavailability in both fasted and fed state. In 
      addition, the bioavailability of RXB from NPs (F8) was found unaffected in the 
      presence of food.

TI  - Direct oral anticoagulant safety during breastfeeding: a narrative review.
PG  - 1465-1471
LID - 10.1007/s00228-021-03154-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There are limited data regarding the safety of direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) during breastfeeding. The aim of the present study is to 
      investigate the extent of excretion of DOACs into human milk according to the 
      available clinical and experimental studies. METHODS: On 16th January 2021, we 
      systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science for all 
      studies which investigated DOACs in breastfeeding without any time frame and 
      language limitation. Search keywords were [breastfeeding, breast feeding, 
      breastfed, lactation, milk secretion OR milk] AND [apixaban OR Eliquist OR 
      rivaroxaban OR Xarelto OR edoxaban OR Savaysa OR dabigatran OR Pradaxa OR 
      dabigatran etexilate OR dabigatran etexilate mesylate OR direct oral 
      anticoagulant OR DOAC OR new oral anticoagulant OR NOAC]. Finally, we identified 
      six articles which reported DOAC use during breastfeeding or lactation. RESULTS 
      AND CONCLUSION: According to the available limited data, dabigatran has the least 
      excretion in human breast milk. Rivaroxaban and dabigatran both have acceptable 
      milk excretion cutoffs, whereas apixaban milk excretion is greater than the 
      maximum allowed range. Further well-designed studies with larger sample sizes are 
      required to generate consistent comparable data and clarify benefits and risks of 
      each DOAC during breastfeeding.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential of solid 
      dispersion adsorbate (SDA) to improve the solubility and bioavailability of 
      rivaroxaban (RXN). SDA of RXN was developed by fusion method using PEG 4000 as 
      carrier and Neusilin as adsorbent. A 3(2) full factorial design was utilized to 
      formulate various SDAs. The selected independent variables were the amount of 
      carrier (X(1)) and amount of adsorbent (X(2)). The responses measured were the 
      time required for 85% drug release (Y(1)) and saturated solubility (Y(2)). MTT 
      assay was employed for cytotoxicity studies on Caco-2 cells. In vivo 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic evaluations were carried out to assess the 
      prepared SDA. Pre-compression evaluation of SDA suggests the prepared batches 
      (B1-B9) possess adequate flow properties and could be used for compression of 
      tablets. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction data signified 
      the conversion of the crystalline form of drug to amorphous form, a key parameter 
      accountable for improvement in drug dissolution. Optimization data suggests that 
      the amount of carrier and amount of adsorbent significantly (P < 0.05) influence 
      both dependent variables. Post-compression data signifies that the 
      compressibility behavior of prepared tablets was within the official standard 
      limits. A significant increase (P < 0.0001) in the in vitro dissolution 
      characteristics of RXN was noticed in optimized SDA (> 85% in 10 min) as compared 
      to the pure drug, marketed product, and directly compressible tablet. 
      Cytotoxicity studies confirmed the nontoxicity of prepared RXN SDA tablets. RXN 
      SDA tablets exhibited 2.79- and 1.85-fold higher AUC in comparison to RXN 
      suspension and Xarelto tablets respectively indicating improved oral 
      bioavailability. Higher bleeding time and percentage of platelet aggregation 
      noticed with RXN SDA tablets in comparison to RXN suspension further substantiate 
      the efficacy of the prepared formulation. In summary, the results showed the 
      potential of RXN SDA tablets to enhance the bioavailability of RXN and hence can 
      be an alternate approach of solid dosage form for its development for commercial 
      application.

TI  - Rivaroxaban crushed tablet suspension characteristics and relative 
      bioavailability in healthy adults when administered orally or via nasogastric 
      tube.
PG  - 321-7

AB  - PURPOSE: Because some patients have difficulty swallowing a whole tablet, we 
      investigated the relative bioavailability of a crushed 20 mg rivaroxaban tablet 
      and of 2 alternative crushed tablet dosing strategies. METHODS: Stability and 
      nasogastric (NG) tube adsorption characteristics of a crushed rivaroxaban tablet 
      were assessed. Then, in 55 healthy adults, relative bioavailability of 
      rivaroxaban administered orally as a whole tablet (Reference [Whole-Oral]), 
      crushed tablet in applesauce suspension (Crushed-Oral), or crushed tablet in 
      water suspension via NG tube (Crushed-NG) were determined. RESULTS: There were no 
      significant changes in mean percent of non-degraded rivaroxaban recovered over 
      4 hours from crushed tablet suspensions (>98.4% recovery across all suspensions 
      and time points) or after NG tube exposure (recovery: 99.1% for silicone and 
      98.9% for polyvinyl chloride NG tubes). Relative bioavailability was similar 
      between Crushed-Oral and Reference dosing (Cmax and AUC∞ were within the 80-125% 
      bioequivalence limits). Relative bioavailability was also similar between the 
      Crushed-NG and Reference dosing (AUC∞ was within bioequivalence limits; Cmax [90% 
      CI range: 78.5-85.8%] was only slightly below the 80% lower bioequivalence 
      limit). CONCLUSIONS: A crushed rivaroxaban tablet was stable and when 
      administered orally or via NG tube, displayed similar relative bioavailability 
      compared to a whole tablet administered orally.

TI  - Rivaroxaban Reduces the Dabigatran Dose Required for Anticoagulation During 
      Simulated Cardiopulmonary Bypass.
PG  - 52-59
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000006019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heparin is the standard anticoagulant for cardiopulmonary bypass 
      (CPB); however, there are problems with its use that make the development of 
      suitable alternatives desirable. Currently, no ideal alternative exists. We have 
      previously reported that the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran can prevent 
      coagulation in simulated CPB at high concentrations. These high concentrations 
      may cause difficulties in achieving the reversal of dabigatran with idarucizumab, 
      given the markedly different pharmacokinetics of the 2 drugs. Herein, we test the 
      hypothesis that the addition of the anti-Xa drug rivaroxaban would provide 
      suitable anticoagulation at a lower concentration of dabigatran given likely 
      synergy between the 2 classes of drugs. The primary goal of the study was to 
      investigate whether the addition of rivaroxaban reduces the concentration of 
      dabigatran necessary to allow 2 hours of simulated CPB. METHODS: The study was 
      performed in sequential steps. Blood collected from consenting healthy donors was 
      used throughout. First, we added graded concentrations of dabigatran and 
      rivaroxaban alone and in combination and assessed inhibition of anticoagulation 
      using thromboelastometry. Using results from this step, combinations of 
      dabigatran and rivaroxaban were tested in both Chandler loop and simulated CPB 
      circuits. Dabigatran and rivaroxaban were added before recalcification, and the 
      circuits were run for 120 minutes. In both models of CPB, 120 minutes of 
      circulation without visible thrombus was considered successful. In the Chandler 
      loop system, idarucizumab was added to reverse anticoagulant effects. In the CPB 
      circuits, the arterial line filters were examined using scanning electron 
      microscope (SEM) to qualitatively assess for fibrin deposition. RESULTS: In vitro 
      analysis of blood samples treated with dabigatran and rivaroxaban showed that 
      dabigatran and rivaroxaban individually prolonged clotting time (CT) in a 
      dose-dependent manner. However, when combined, the drugs behaved synergistically. 
      In the Chandler loop system, dabigatran 2400 and 4800 ng/mL plus rivaroxaban (150 
      ng/mL) effectively prevented clot formation and reduced the dynamics of clot 
      propagation for 120 minutes. Idarucizumab (250-1000 µg/mL) effectively reversed 
      anticoagulation. In the CPB circuits, dabigatran (2500 ng/mL) and rivaroxaban 
      (200 ng/mL) were successful in allowing 120 minutes of simulated CPB and 
      prevented fibrin deposition. Biomarkers of coagulation activation did not 
      increase during simulated CPB. Heparin controls performed similarly to dabigatran 
      and rivaroxaban. CONCLUSIONS: The dual administration of oral anticoagulant drugs 
      (dabigatran and Rivaroxaban) with different pharmacologic mechanisms of action 
      produced synergistic inhibition of coagulation in vitro and successfully 
      prevented clotting during simulated CPB.

TI  - Model-informed bridging of rivaroxaban doses for thromboprophylaxis in pediatric 
      patients aged 9 years and older with congenital heart disease.
PG  - 1111-1121
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12830 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is approved in various regions for the treatment of acute venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) in children aged between 0 and 18 years and was recently 
      investigated for thromboprophylaxis in children aged between 2 and 8 years (with 
      body weights <30 kg) with congenital heart disease who had undergone the Fontan 
      procedure. In the absence of clinical data, rivaroxaban doses for 
      thromboprophylaxis in post-Fontan children aged 9 years and older or ≥30 kg were 
      derived by a bridging approach that used physiologically-based pharmacokinetic 
      (PBPK) and population pharmacokinetic (popPK) models based on pharmacokinetic 
      (PK) data from 588 pediatric patients and from adult patients who received 10 mg 
      once daily for thromboprophylaxis after major orthopedic surgeries as a 
      reference. Both models showed a tendency toward underestimating rivaroxaban 
      exposure in post-Fontan patients aged between 2 and 5 years but accurately 
      described rivaroxaban PK in post-Fontan patients aged between 5 and 8 years. 
      Under the assumption that hepatic function is not impaired in post-Fontan 
      patients, PBPK and popPK simulations indicated that half of the rivaroxaban doses 
      for the same body weight given to pediatric patients treated for acute VTE would 
      yield in pediatric post-Fontan patients exposures similar to the exposure 
      observed in adult patients receiving 10 mg rivaroxaban once daily for 
      thromboprophylaxis. Simulation-derived doses (7.5 mg rivaroxaban once daily for 
      body weights 30-<50 kg and 10 mg once daily for body weights ≥50 kg) were 
      therefore included in the recent US label of rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis 
      in children aged 2 years and older with congenital heart disease who have 
      undergone the Fontan procedure.

AB  - Obesity is an epidemic with rising prevalence, and obese patients are predisposed 
      to comorbid conditions that increase risk for thromboembolic events. It is 
      critical to identify safe and effective anticoagulation therapy for use in this 
      population. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a preferred option for 
      anticoagulation in patients of normal weight due to many benefits and equivalent 
      safety and efficacy to their vitamin K antagonist counterparts. However, the 
      safety and efficacy of DOACs in obese patients is not well understood. This 
      review describes recent studies on the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy, and 
      clinical outcomes of the DOACs apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban and dabigatran in 
      obese patient populations. DOACs may be a beneficial alternative to vitamin K 
      antagonist therapy in obese patient populations.

OAB - The incidence of obesity within the USA is on the rise, as is that of the medical 
      conditions that often accompany it. These include conditions that can predispose 
      individuals to forming clots in the blood, such as atrial fibrillation, which is 
      a form of an abnormal heartbeat, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which is 
      caused by fat buildup around the liver. Therefore, it is important that we have 
      effective medicines that can prevent clotting in an obese patient population. 
      Direct oral anticoagulants are a new, preferred medication option for this, but 
      it is unclear how safe or effective they are in obese people; there is some 
      concern that because of increased body weight, individuals may not get enough 
      medicine to effectively prevent clots from forming, which would ultimately put 
      them at risk for clotting and serious adverse health outcomes such as stroke. 
      This review describes recent studies on the use of the direct oral anticoagulants 
      apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban and dabigatran in obese patients, and whether 
      they are a safe and effective form of anticoagulation in this population.

TI  - Management of Elective Surgery and Emergent Bleeding with Direct Oral 
      Anticoagulants.
PG  - 124
LID - 10.1007/s11886-017-0930-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review was to offer practical management 
      strategies for when patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants require 
      elective surgery or present with bleeding complications. RECENT FINDINGS: 
      Clinical practice guidelines are now available on the timing of periprocedural 
      interruption of treatment with the newer direct oral anticoagulants based on 
      their pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and based on findings from cohort 
      studies and clinical trials. An antibody that reverses the effects of dabigatran 
      is now available, and a factor Xa decoy is being developed as an antidote to 
      apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. The timing of interruption of 
      direct oral anticoagulants for elective surgery is based on multiple factors, 
      including pharmacologic properties and interactions, the patient's renal 
      function, and the type of planned surgery. There is little role for 
      low-molecular-weight heparin bridging. Idarucizumab is the treatment of choice 
      for dabigatran-related life-threatening bleeding, while andexanet alfa is being 
      developed to reverse factor Xa inhibitors.

TI  - Sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB) and glyceryl monooleate (GMO) hybrid 
      nanoparticles for bioavailability enhancement of rivaroxaban: an optimization 
      study.
PG  - 928-938
LID - 10.1080/10837450.2023.2274944 [doi]
AB  - This study aims to improve the RXB bioavailability using hybrid nanoparticles. A 
      modified melt dispersion technique created different formulas with varying 
      GMO-SAIB: RXB and GMO: SAIB ratios, with fixed GMO-SAIB: poloxamer 407 ratios. 
      The PS, PDI, ZP, and EE were measured to determine the optimal formula, which was 
      selected using Design-Expert™ software. The optimized formula was lyophilized and 
      tested for PS, PDI, ZP, and EE. The chosen lyophilized formula (L4) was 
      characterized using FTIR, DSC, PXRD, dissolution studies, and pharmacokinetics 
      studies. The study found correlations between variables and identified how 
      GMO-SAIB concentration affects drug encapsulation. The dissolution parameters 
      were calculated, including % Q5 and % DE). The % Q5 values were 68.4 ± 1.7% and 
      89.7 ± 3.6% for Xarelto and L4 tablets, respectively. The % DE values were 
      89.7 ± 0.4% and 97.5 ± 2.1% for Xarelto and L4 tablets, respectively. The AUC 
      values were 2117.0 ng.h/mL (±77.3) and 3919.4 ng.h/mL (±134.8) for Xarelto and L4 
      tablets, respectively. The Cmax values were 241.3 ng/mL (±21.0) and 521.5 ng/mL 
      (±91.5) for Xarelto and L4 tablets, respectively. In conclusion, the study found 
      that using GMO-SAIB as co-formers effectively enhanced the bioavailability of 
      RXB. The authors recommend using the hybrid nanoparticles technique and suggest 
      further research to enhance its effectiveness for drug delivery.

TI  - Drug interactions with rivaroxaban following total joint replacement surgery.
PG  - 1232-8
LID - 10.1345/aph.1R055 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate potential drug-drug interactions with rivaroxaban in 
      patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR) 
      surgeries. DATA SOURCES: PubMed; January 2009-April 2012 abstract databases of 
      major congresses for hematology and cardiovascular medicine. STUDY SELECTION AND 
      DATA EXTRACTION: Searches were performed using the key words rivaroxaban and drug 
      interaction. Studies were included if they evaluated interactions with drugs that 
      are commonly used in patients undergoing THR or TKR, based on our clinical 
      experience. DATA SYNTHESIS: A Phase 1 study found that coadministration of 
      rivaroxaban and the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen 
      significantly increased bleeding time. However, in a retrospective analysis of 4 
      large trials evaluating rivaroxaban in patients undergoing THR or TKR, the 
      difference between major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was not 
      significantly different between NSAID users and nonusers. In addition, proton 
      pump inhibitors, which are frequently coadministered with NSAIDs to prevent 
      gastrointestinal toxicity, have not been demonstrated to cause any appreciable 
      changes in rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. A Phase 2 study that 
      evaluated several doses and administration intervals of rivaroxaban in 
      combination with aspirin or both aspirin and clopidogrel in patients with acute 
      coronary syndrome found that clinically significant bleeding events occurred in 
      patients receiving rivaroxaban 10 mg daily (the dose approved for the orthopedic 
      indication). However, this risk was not great enough to end the trial early. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Phase 1 drug-drug interaction studies in healthy humans provided 
      little insight into the pharmacodynamic drug interactions between rivaroxaban and 
      NSAIDs or antiplatelet agents. A pooled analysis of the RECORD (Regulation of 
      Coagulation in Orthopedic Surgery to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary 
      Embolism) trials and data from other large trials provides clinical evidence that 
      these agents can be coadministered with rivaroxaban, as long as proper monitoring 
      is instituted.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with direct anticoagulants in the 
      management of cancer-associated thrombosis.
PG  - 2369-2376
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15785 [doi]
AB  - Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are common in cancer management and complicate the 
      choice of anticoagulation in cancer-associated thrombosis. Cancer confers an 
      increased risk of thrombotic events. Also, more bleeding events are observed in 
      those who receive anticoagulation compared to those without cancer. In the 
      treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      have been found to be at least as effective as low-molecular weight heparins, 
      which became the standard of care after several trials demonstrated superiority 
      over vitamin K antagonists. Non-inferiority compared to low-molecular weight 
      heparins has been shown for rivaroxaban, edoxaban and apixaban with a signal of 
      fewer recurrent thrombotic events, albeit with an increase in bleeding events. 
      Yet, potentially major pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been 
      identified as a reason to withhold DOACs and to rather choose an alternative. 
      Practical guidance on what constitutes a major pharmacokinetic interaction and/or 
      how to deal with these interactions in clinical practice is limited. Hence, here 
      we have provided a framework to allow clinicians to better deal with 
      pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between DOACs and cancer therapies in the 
      management of cancer-associated thrombosis. In this review we have discussed the 
      current literature, how the pharmacokinetic profile links to the label 
      information on DDI, and have provided a practical proposal, applied to a clinical 
      case.

TI  - Minimizing the Risk of Bleeding with NOACs in the Elderly.
PG  - 491-500
LID - 10.1007/s40266-016-0376-z [doi]
AB  - Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban have gained a lot of popularity as alternatives to warfarin for 
      anticoagulation in various clinical settings. However, there is conflicting 
      opinion regarding the absolute benefit of NOAC use in elderly patients. Low body 
      mass, altered body composition of fat and muscle, renal impairment and concurrent 
      presence of multiple comorbidities predispose elderly patients to many adverse 
      effects with NOACs that are typically not seen in younger patients. There have 
      been reports that NOAC use, in particular dabigatran, is associated with a higher 
      risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in the elderly. Diagnosis and management of 
      NOAC-associated bleeding in the elderly is difficult due to the absence of 
      commonly available drug-specific antidotes that can rapidly reverse the 
      anticoagulant effects. Moreover, in elderly patients, a number of factors such as 
      the presence of other comorbid medical conditions, renal insufficiency, drug 
      interactions from polypharmacy, risk of falls and dementia need to be considered 
      before prescribing anticoagulation therapy. Elderly patients frequently have 
      compromised renal function, and therefore dose adjustments according to 
      creatinine clearance for NOACs need to be made. As each NOAC comes with its own 
      unique advantages and safety profile, an individualized case by case approach 
      should be adopted to decide on the appropriate anticoagulation regimen for 
      elderly patients after weighing the overall risks and benefits of therapy.

AB  - Modern direct-acting anticoagulants are rapidly replacing vitamin K antagonists 
      (VKA) in the management of millions of patients worldwide who require 
      anticoagulation. These drugs include agents that inhibit activated factor X (FXa) 
      (such as apixaban and rivaroxaban) or thrombin (such as dabigatran), and are 
      collectively known today as non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Since bleeding 
      is the most common and most dangerous side effect of long-term anticoagulation, 
      and because NOACs have very different mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetics 
      compared with VKA, physicians are naturally concerned about the lack of 
      experience regarding frequency, management and outcome of NOAC-associated 
      bleeding in daily care. This review appraises trial and registry (or 
      "real-world") data pertaining to bleeding complications in patients taking NOACs 
      and VKA and provides practical recommendations for the management of acute 
      bleeding situations.

AB  - The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in breastfeeding women is currently 
      challenging due to limited safety data for breastfeeding infants, and there have 
      been no previous studies on the drug concentration in breastfeeding infants. We 
      treated 2 patients (one case was twin pregnancy) with venous thromboembolisms in 
      breastfeeding women administered rivaroxaban at our institution. Blood samples 
      from the mothers and breastmilk samples were collected at time 0 and 2 h after 
      the rivaroxaban administration, breastfeeding was conducted 2 h after the 
      rivaroxaban administration, and blood samples from the infants were collected 2 h 
      after breastfeeding (4 h after maternal rivaroxaban administration). The 
      milk-to-plasma (M:P) ratios were 0.27 in Case 1 and 0.32 in Case 2. The estimated 
      relative infant dose (RID) was 0.82 % in Case 1 Children 1 and 2, and 1.27 % in 
      Case 2. The rivaroxaban concentration in the infant plasma was below the lower 
      limit of quantification in all infants. In addition, even in the high-exposure 
      case simulation based on 5 days of breastfeeding in Case 2, the infant plasma 
      concentration level was below the lower limit of quantification. At 3 months of 
      follow-up, breastfeeding was continued, and all infants grew and developed 
      without any health problems including bleeding events. The current case series 
      showed that there were no pharmacokinetic or clinical concerns for breastfeeding 
      women or breastfed infants, and provides support for rivaroxaban as a safe 
      treatment option for these patients.

TI  - Reversal of Apixaban and Rivaroxaban Using Activated Prothrombin Complex 
      Concentrates in Patients with Major Bleeding.
PG  - 295-299
LID - 10.1007/s40256-019-00383-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical experience with using activated prothrombin complex 
      concentrates (aPCCs) to reverse the effects of factor Xa inhibitors is limited. 
      OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to assess the achievement of effective clinical 
      hemostasis using aPCC in patients on chronic apixaban or rivaroxaban therapy 
      presenting with major bleeding in whom a reversal agent is warranted. We also 
      assessed the safety of the drug. METHODS: A retrospective medical records review 
      was conducted at a tertiary referral medical center in the USA. Patients 
      presenting with major bleeding while receiving apixaban or rivaroxaban and 
      treated with aPCC were included. Clinical hemostasis was assessed using 
      International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis Scientific and Standardization 
      Subcommittee criteria. RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were included in the 
      study. The most common site of bleeding was intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) 
      (n = 18 [51.4%]), followed by gastrointestinal bleed (n = 10 [28.6%]). Clinical 
      hemostasis was achieved in 24 (68.6%) patients; 11 patients (31.4%) did not 
      achieve clinical hemostasis; nine of these patients had ICH. Seven of the 
      patients who did not achieve hemostasis died during hospitalization. Three (8.6%) 
      patients experienced thromboembolic events during hospitalization. In total, 21 
      (60%) patients were receiving concomitant medications that interact with 
      anti-factor Xa inhibitors and can increase the risk of bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      study suggests that aPCC could be an option in patients with major bleeding 
      associated with apixaban or rivaroxaban. It may be an alternative for patients 
      who need anticoagulation reversal if the specific antidote, andexanet alfa, is 
      unavailable.

AB  - Prothrombin time (PT) has been widely used for measuring anticoagulation 
      intensity under rivaroxaban therapy, but precise information has not been well 
      established yet. Consecutive 96 non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) under 
      rivaroxaban between Jan/June, 2015 were recruited. Serum concentration (SC) and 
      PT with 5 representative reagents available in Japan (Neoplastin Plus®, 
      Thromborel S®, Thrombocheck PT®, Thrombocheck PT Plus®, and Recombiplastin®) at 
      2-4 hours after (peak) and before intake of rivaroxaban (trough) were measured at 
      outpatient clinic in the cardiovascular institute (CVI ARO study 1). Nonlinear 
      mixed-effects modelling was used to model the population pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban. An oral one-compartment model was employed to 
      describe the population pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. The pharmacokinetics of 
      rivaroxaban were affected by creatinine clearance, alanine aminotransferase, and 
      use of CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors. PTs with 5 reagents were predicted by 
      pharmacodinamic models with SC, hematocrit, serum albumin, and age, with medium 
      predicting ability (highest/lowest R2 = 0.746/0.658 in Recombiplastin/Thromborel 
      S, respectively). This population analysis in NVAF patients under rivaroxaban 
      therapy demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban was described by an 
      oral one-compartment model with expected covariates, and can be assessed by PT 
      with available reagents in Japan with medium predicting ability.

AB  - The "on-therapy range" of direct oral anticoagulants is the 90% interval of drug 
      concentration. Previously, we reported the on-therapy range of rivaroxaban in a 
      single-center cohort. The present study aimed to confirm the range and 
      intraindividual reproducibility in a multicenter cohort.Eligible patients with 
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation under rivaroxaban treatment for prevention of 
      ischemic stroke were enrolled from nine institutes in Tokyo, Japan, between June 
      2016 and May 2017 (n = 324). The first and second (three months later) blood 
      samples both taken within 1-5 hours after rivaroxaban intake were analyzed (n = 
      219). Plasma concentration of rivaroxaban (PC-Riv) and prothrombin time (PT) with 
      five reagents were measured.The 90% interval of PC-Riv was 47.3-532.9 ng/mL. The 
      90% interval of PT measured with RecombiPlasTin 2G was 11.8-22.3 seconds, the 
      widest range among the five reagents examined. PC-Riv reproducibility within a 
      90% interval was evaluated bidirectionally (first-to-second and second-to-first), 
      and 92.4% of samples were reproducible. The change rate (CR) of PC-Riv between 
      two samplings ranged widely, and high CR (≥54.3%, cutoff for predicting 
      non-reproducibility) was predicted by concomitant drugs (non-dihydropyridine 
      calcium antagonist and thiazide) and mitral regurgitation.We reported the 
      on-therapy range of rivaroxaban in a multicenter cohort. This range was 
      consistent with that of a single-center cohort and was highly reproducible within 
      three months in daily clinical practice. However, caution is necessary regarding 
      several factors that may affect the intraindividual variation of PC-Riv.

TI  - Rivaroxaban: a novel, oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor.
PG  - 167-81
LID - 10.1592/phco.29.2.167 [doi]
AB  - Thromboembolic disorders such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, 
      myocardial infarction, and stroke often result in long-term disability and/or 
      mortality. The anticoagulants currently available have been effective in the 
      treatment and prevention of these disorders; however, parenteral administration, 
      variable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, drug and dietary interactions, 
      and a requirement for frequent monitoring of efficacy and safety limit use of 
      these drugs. Rivaroxaban is a novel, oral factor Xa inhibitor in clinical 
      development for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic diseases. 
      Rivaroxaban is a small molecule directed at active sites, and the agent 
      mechanistically differs from traditional anticoagulants, such as heparins and 
      fondaparinux, in that its activity is independent of antithrombin and its ability 
      to inhibit prothrombinase bound factor Xa. In addition, preclinical and clinical 
      trial data indicate that rivaroxaban has predictable pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics, which are features that differentiate it from oral vitamin K 
      antagonists. Phase II studies showed that rivaroxaban is safe and well tolerated 
      across a wide range of doses. Furthermore, completed phase III studies 
      demonstrated its efficacy in the prevention of venous thromboembolism after 
      orthopedic surgery. Additional studies are now under way to evaluate the use of 
      rivaroxaban in the treatment and prevention of other venous and arterial 
      thromboembolic conditions.

TI  - Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling to predict drug-drug interaction 
      of enzalutamide with combined P-gp and CYP3A substrates.
PG  - 365-376
LID - 10.1007/s10928-023-09867-7 [doi]
AB  - Enzalutamide is known to strongly induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). 
      Furthermore, enzalutamide showed induction and inhibition of P-glycoprotein 
      (P-gp) in in vitro studies. A clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study between 
      enzalutamide and digoxin, a typical P-gp substrate, suggested enzalutamide has 
      weak inhibitory effect on P-gp substrates. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), 
      such as apixaban and rivaroxaban, are dual substrates of CYP3A4 and P-gp, and 
      hence it is recommended to avoid co-administration of these DOACs with combined 
      P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers. Enzalutamide's net effect on P-gp and CYP3A for 
      apixaban and rivaroxaban plasma exposures is of interest to physicians who treat 
      patients for venous thromboembolism with prostate cancer. Accordingly, a 
      physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) analysis was performed to predict 
      the magnitude of DDI on apixaban and rivaroxaban exposures in the presence of 
      160 mg once-daily dosing of enzalutamide. The PBPK models of enzalutamide and M2, 
      a major metabolite of enzalutamide which also has potential to induce CYP3A and 
      P-gp and inhibit P-gp, were developed and verified as perpetrators of CYP3A-and 
      P-gp-mediated interaction. Simulation results predicted a 31% decrease in AUC and 
      no change in C(max) for apixaban and a 45% decrease in AUC and a 25% decrease in 
      C(max) for rivaroxaban when 160 mg multiple doses of enzalutamide were 
      co-administered. In summary, enzalutamide is considered to decrease apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban exposure through the combined effects of CYP3A induction and net P-gp 
      inhibition. Concurrent use of these drugs warrants careful monitoring for 
      efficacy and safety.

TI  - Anticoagulation in pediatric cancer-associated venous thromboembolism: a subgroup 
      analysis of EINSTEIN-Jr.
PG  - 5821-5828
LID - 10.1182/bloodadvances.2022008160 [doi]
AB  - Anticoagulant treatment of pediatric cancer-associated venous thromboembolism 
      (VTE) has not been prospectively evaluated. Management of anticoagulation for 
      cancer-associated VTE is often challenged by drug interactions and treatment 
      interruptions. A total of 56 of the 500 children (11.2%) with VTE who 
      participated in the recent EINSTEIN-Jr randomized study had cancer (hematologic 
      malignancy, 64.3%, solid malignant tumor, 35.7%). Children were allocated to 
      either therapeutic-dose bodyweight-adjusted oral rivaroxaban (n=40) or standard 
      anticoagulation with heparins, with or without vitamin K antagonists (n=16) and 
      received a median of 30 concomitant medications. Based on sparse blood sampling 
      at steady-state, pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of rivaroxaban were derived 
      using population PK modeling. During the 3 months of treatment, no recurrent VTE 
      or major bleeding occurred (95% confidence interval, 0.0%-6.4%), and 3-month 
      repeat imaging showed complete or partial vein recanalization in 20 and 24 of 
      52 evaluable children (38.5% and 46.2%, respectively). Anticoagulant treatment 
      was interrupted 70 times in 26 (46.4%) children because of thrombocytopenia, 
      invasive procedures, or adverse events, for a mean individual period of 5.8 days. 
      Anticoagulant therapy was resumed in therapeutic doses and was not associated 
      with thrombotic or bleeding complications. Rivaroxaban exposures were within the 
      adult exposure range and similar to those observed in children with VTE who did 
      not have cancer-associated VTE. Rivaroxaban and standard anticoagulants appeared 
      safe and efficacious and were associated with reduced clot burden in most 
      children with cancer-associated VTE, including those who had anticoagulant 
      treatment interruptions. Rivaroxaban exposures were within the adult exposure 
      range despite significant polypharmacy use. This trial was registered at 
      www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02234843.

TI  - Preparation and Optimization of Rivaroxaban by Self-Nanoemulsifying Drug Delivery 
      System (SNEDDS) for Enhanced Oral Bioavailability and No Food Effect.
PG  - 1847-1859
LID - 10.1208/s12249-018-0991-6 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, a novel self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) was 
      used to improve the oral bioavailability in fasted state and diminish the food 
      effect for rivaroxaban. Oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant were selected by 
      saturated solubility study. IPM, Tween80, and 1,2-propanediol were finally 
      selected as oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant, respectively. The 
      pseudo-ternary-phase diagram was utilized to optimize the preliminary composition 
      of SNEDDS formulation. The optimized rivaroxaban-SNEDDS formulation was selected 
      by central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology. Optimized 
      SNEDDS formulation was evaluated for drug content, self-emulsifying time, droplet 
      size, zeta potential, polydispersity index, Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) 
      spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The drug dissolution 
      profile compared to the commercial formulation Xarelto® (20 mg rivaroxaban) was 
      determined in four different media (pH 1.2HCl, pH 4.5NaAc-HAc, pH 6.8PBS, and 
      water). The result indicated that the SNEDDS formulation had successfully 
      increased the drug solubility in four different media. A HPLC-MS method that 
      indicated a high sensitivity, strong attribute, and high accuracy characteristic 
      was built to measure the drug concentration in plasma. The fast/fed in vivo 
      pharmacokinetics studies of SNEDDS formulation and Xarelto® were carried out in 
      adult beagle dog, rivaroxaban with no food effect was achieved in SNEDDS 
      formulation compared with Xarelto® in fed state. The result suggested that SNEDDS 
      formulation in this study is useful to increase the oral bioavailability and 
      diminish the food effect in fasted state.

AB  - The effect of the oral direct activated factor X (factor Xa) inhibitor apixaban 
      on tissue factor-induced thrombin generation in human plasma was investigated in 
      vitro using the calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT) method and compared with 
      the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban and the direct thrombin inhibitor 
      dabigatran. Pooled citrated, anticoagulated, platelet-poor human plasma was 
      spiked with apixaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran at concentrations of 0.01 to 10 
      μM. The inhibitory potencies of the compounds were quantified by 5 CAT 
      parameters: the control thrombin lag time (LT) and time to thrombin peak (TTP) 
      for the doubling of inhibitor concentration (IC2x); and the control endogenous 
      thrombin potential (ETP), thrombin peak, and maximum rate of thrombin generation 
      (Vmax) for the inhibitor concentration, which inhibited 50% (IC50). The 
      inhibitors modified CAT concentration dependently. Their inhibitory potencies, 
      expressed as IC2x LT, IC2x TTP, IC50 ETP, IC50 peak thrombin, and IC50 Vmax, were 
      as follows: 0.10 ± 0.01, 0.19 ± 0.02, 0.65 ± 0.11, 0.089 ± 0.019, and 0.049 ± 
      0.007 μM for apixaban; 0.049 ± 0.007, 0.070 ± 0.009, 0.43 ± 0.07, 0.048 ± 0.008, 
      and 0.022 ± 0.005 μM for rivaroxaban; and 0.063 ± 0.019, 0.18 ± 0.06, 0.50 ± 
      0.08, 0.55 ± 0.06, and 0.57 ± 0.27 μM for dabigatran. In summary, apixaban, 
      rivaroxaban, and dabigatran have similar potencies in the prolongation of LT and 
      TTP. The CAT parameters that are related to the rate of thrombin generation 
      during the propagation phase (ie, peak thrombin and Vmax) are more sensitive to 
      activities of apixaban and rivaroxaban than dabigatran. The ETP is the least 
      sensitive parameter for measuring the activities of these inhibitors. Recombinant 
      activated factor VII at 5 and 50 μg/mL reversed the anticoagulant effects of 
      apixaban more at 0.2 μM than at 2 μM. Our study suggests that the CAT method is a 
      sensitive assay to monitor the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of 
      apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran, and may provide insight into the mechanism 
      of action of these inhibitors. Recombinant activated factor VII may have some 
      potential to reverse the anticoagulant effects of apixaban in vitro.

TI  - Rivaroxaban: population pharmacokinetic analyses in patients treated for acute 
      deep-vein thrombosis and exposure simulations in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation treated for stroke prevention.
PG  - 675-86

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Rivaroxaban is an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor, 
      which is at an advanced stage of clinical development for prevention and 
      treatment of thromboembolic disorders. Two phase II studies, ODIXa-DVT and 
      EINSTEIN DVT, assessed the efficacy and safety of oral rivaroxaban (once daily or 
      twice daily) for treatment of acute deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). Population 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses of rivaroxaban in patients in these 
      two phase II studies were conducted to characterize the 
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban and the relationship between 
      important patient covariates and model parameters. Exposure simulations in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) were also performed in order to predict 
      the exposure of rivaroxaban, using modified demographic data reflecting the 
      characteristics of a typical AF population. METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic 
      model was developed using plasma samples from these patients. Various simulations 
      were conducted to explore the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in patients with 
      DVT and to predict exposure in those with AF. Correlations between plasma 
      rivaroxaban concentrations and the prothrombin time, Factor Xa activity, HepTest® 
      and activated partial thromboplastin time were also described. RESULTS: The 
      pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in patients with DVT were found to be consistent 
      and predictable across all doses studied. The area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) increased dose dependently. The same total daily 
      doses given once daily achieved higher maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) 
      values (∼20%) and lower trough (minimum) plasma concentration (C(trough)) values 
      (∼60%) than when given twice daily; however, the 5th-95th percentile ranges for 
      these parameters overlapped. Rivaroxaban clearance was moderately influenced by 
      age and renal function, and the volume of distribution was influenced by age, 
      body weight and sex; the effects were within the observed interindividual 
      variability. Simulations in virtual patient populations with AF showed that a 
      rivaroxaban dose of 15 mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance of 
      30-49 mL/min would achieve AUC and C(max) values similar to those observed with 
      20 mg once daily in patients with normal renal function. The prothrombin time 
      correlated almost linearly with plasma rivaroxaban concentrations (≤500 μg/L). 
      CONCLUSION: Population analyses of phase II clinical data indicated that the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of all rivaroxaban doses were predictable 
      and were affected by expected demographic factors in patients with acute DVT.

AB  - Aim: An eco-friendly ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry method was developed to study the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban 
      and ticagrelor in rat plasma, utilizing moxifloxacin as an internal standard. The 
      food-drug interaction between grapefruit juice and these drugs was also 
      investigated. Methods: Liquid-liquid extraction was used. A nonporous stationary 
      phase Agilent(®) Poroshell 120EC C18 column was used with methanol: 0.1% aqueous 
      formic acid (95:5 v/v) as a mobile phase. The detection was performed in multiple 
      reaction monitoring mode using positive electrospray ionization. The method's 
      validation was conducted in accordance with US FDA and European Medicines Agency 
      guidelines. Results & conclusion: Grapefruit juice should be ingested with 
      caution in patients treated with antithrombotic medications as it may increase 
      their plasma concentration, inducing bleeding, and requires close clinical 
      monitoring.

TI  - Rivaroxaban-loaded SLNs with treatment potential of deep vein thrombosis: 
      in-vitro, in-vivo, and toxicity evaluation.
PG  - 625-637
LID - 10.1080/10837450.2023.2231069 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Rivaroxaban (RXB), a novel Xa inhibitor having groundbreaking 
      therapeutic potential. However, this drug is associated with few limitations, 
      including its pharmacokinetics related toxicities. Here, we developed RXB-loaded 
      SLNs (RXB-SLNs) to improve its biopharmaceutical profile. Methods: High pressure 
      homogenizer was used to prepare RXB-SLNs, followed by their particle 
      characterization, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Dynamic light 
      scattering (DSC), and Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis. Beside this, 
      in-vitro, ex-vivo, and in-vivo evaluation, prothrombin time assessment and 
      toxicity was investigated. RESULTS: RXB-SLNs had their particle size in nano 
      range (99.1 ± 5.50 nm) with excellent morphology and low polydispersity index 
      (0.402 ± 0.02) and suitable zeta potential (-25.9 ± 1.4 mV). The incorporation 
      efficiency was observed around 95.9 ± 3.9%. In-vitro release profiles of the 
      RXB-SLNs exhibited enhanced dissolution (89 ± 9.91%) as compared to pure drug 
      (11 ± 1.43%) after 24 h of the study. PK study demonstrated a seven times 
      enhanced bioavailability of RXB-SLNs when compared with pure drug. Furthermore, 
      RXB-SLNs exhibited an expressive anti-coagulant behavior in human and rat blood 
      plasma. Also, the final formulation exhibited no toxicity after oral 
      administration of the SLNs. CONCLUSIONS: All together, these studies revealed the 
      capability of the SLNs for carrying the RXB with enhanced therapeutic efficacy 
      and no toxicity, most importantly for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis.

TI  - Anti-Factor Xa Activity of Standard and Japan-Specific Doses of Rivaroxaban in 
      Thai Patients With Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 1075-1082
LID - 10.1253/circj.CJ-20-0056 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recommended rivaroxaban doses for stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation (SPAF) are 20 and 15 mg/day in patients with normal and reduced 
      renal function, respectively, but lower doses (15 and 10 mg) have been tested and 
      approved in Japan. It is not known whether 15 and 10 mg rivaroxaban are 
      appropriate in other Asian populations. This study compared the anti-Factor Xa 
      (FXa) activity of 20 and 15 mg rivaroxaban in Thai patients with normal renal 
      function and 15 and 10 mg rivaroxaban in patients with reduced renal function. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients receiving 
      rivaroxaban (mean [±SD] age 69.3±9.1 years, mean creatinine clearance 59.2±22.7 
      mL/min) were enrolled. The anti-FXa activity of standard rivaroxaban and 
      Japan-specific doses was measured at peak and trough concentrations. Median 
      anti-FXa activity at peak concentrations was significantly higher for the 
      standard than Japan-specific dose. Median anti-FXa activity measured at the 
      trough was significantly higher for the standard dose only in those with impaired 
      renal function. A higher proportion of patients receiving the Japan-specific 
      rather than standard dose had anti-FXa activity at peak concentrations within the 
      expected range (87.7% vs. 64.4%; P=0.001). One-third of those receiving the 
      standard dose had anti-FXa activity higher than the expected range. CONCLUSIONS: 
      A significantly higher proportion of Thai patients receiving the Japan-specific 
      dose of rivaroxaban had anti-FXa activity at peak concentrations within the 
      expected range.

TI  - Persistent Rivaroxaban Effect Due to Impaired Renal Clearance and Medication 
      Effects.
PG  - 211-216
LID - 10.1093/labmed/lmz044 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban (Xarelto; Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc) is a direct oral 
      anticoagulant (DOAC) that works by directly inhibiting the active site of factor 
      Xa (FXa). Rivaroxaban is metabolized and cleared via the kidney and liver. The 
      results of various studies have shown that patients with severe renal impairment 
      should receive reduced dosages of rivaroxaban or another anticoagulant due to 
      impaired clearance. Although it is not required, monitoring rivaroxaban is useful 
      in some conditions; however, the assays required for such monitoring are not 
      readily available. Herein, we present a case of a 68-year-old Caucasian male 
      patient who was receiving rivaroxaban (20 mg/day) for atrial flutter and had mild 
      renal impairment. The patient was found to have increased effect of rivaroxaban 
      due to further impairment of renal clearance caused by several renally cleared 
      medications. This case highlights the importance of closely examining the renal 
      function of and medication list for a patient before starting DOACs such as 
      rivaroxaban.

TI  - Impact of gene polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters on 
      trough concentrations of rivaroxaban in patients with atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 297-304
LID - 10.1111/bcpt.13488 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is excreted from the body via multiple pathways involving glomerular 
      filtration, drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. In this study, we aimed 
      to examine the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms in P-glycoprotein, 
      breast cancer resistance protein, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 and CYP2J2 on the 
      pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. Eighty-six patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF) undergoing AF catheter ablation were enrolled in this study. 
      In these analyses, the dose-adjusted plasma trough concentration ratio (C(0h) /D) 
      of rivaroxaban was used as the pharmacokinetic index. The median (quartile range) 
      rivaroxaban C(0h) /D was 3.39 (2.08-5.21) ng/mL/mg (coefficient of variation: 
      80.5%). The C(0h) /D did not differ significantly among ABCB1 c.3435C>T, 
      c.2677G>A/T, c.1236C>T, ABCG2 c.421C>A, CYP3A5*3 and CYP2J2*7 genotypes. Stepwise 
      selection multiple linear regression analysis showed that the estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate was the only independent factor influencing the C(0h) 
      /D of rivaroxaban (R(2)  = 0.152, P < 0.001). There was a significant correlation 
      between the C(0h) of rivaroxaban and prothrombin time (PT) (rho = 0.357, P = 
      0.001). In patients with NVAF, pharmacokinetic genotype tests are unlikely to be 
      useful for prediction of the C(0h) of rivaroxaban.

TI  - Impaired Rivaroxaban Clearance in Mild Renal Insufficiency With Verapamil 
      Coadministration: Potential Implications for Bleeding Risk and Dose Selection.
PG  - 533-540
LID - 10.1002/jcph.1040 [doi]
AB  - Pharmacokinetics and antithrombotic effects of the Factor Xa inhibitor 
      rivaroxaban were studied in subjects with mild renal insufficiency concurrently 
      taking the P-glycoprotein and moderate CYP3A inhibitor verapamil, a drug commonly 
      administered to patients with hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or atrial 
      fibrillation. Age-matched controls with normal renal function were studied 
      concurrently. Subjects' overall mean age was 59 years. Mean creatinine clearance 
      values in the 2 groups were 105 and 71 mL/min. After single 20-mg oral doses, 
      rivaroxaban area under the curve (AUC) was increased by a factor of 1.11 (ratio 
      of geometric means [RGM]) in mild renal insufficiency compared to controls. 
      Verapamil coadministration independently increased AUC to the same extent in both 
      the mild renal insufficiency and control groups (RGM, 1.39 and 1.43). Concurrent 
      mild renal insufficiency and verapamil produced additive inhibition compared to 
      controls without verapamil (RGM, 1.58). Prothrombin time (PT) prolongation and 
      Factor Xa inhibition tracked plasma rivaroxaban, and were enhanced by verapamil. 
      Concentration-response relationships for PT (linear) and Factor Xa inhibition 
      (hyperbolic) were unaffected by renal function or verapamil. The absolute and 
      relative increases in rivaroxaban AUC caused by verapamil in mild renal 
      insufficiency subjects are potentially associated with an increased bleeding 
      risk. Modification of recommended dosage may be required in this combination of 
      circumstances to reduce risk to patients.

TI  - Rivaroxaban: a new oral factor Xa inhibitor.
PG  - 376-81
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.202978 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is a direct inhibitor of factor Xa, a coagulation factor at a 
      critical juncture in the blood coagulation pathway leading to thrombin generation 
      and clot formation. It is selective for human factor Xa, for which it has >10 
      000-fold greater selectivity than for other biologically relevant serine 
      proteases (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC(50)], >20 micromol/L). 
      Rivaroxaban inhibits factor Xa in a concentration-dependent manner (inhibitory 
      constant [K(i)], 0.4 nmol/L) and binds rapidly (kinetic association rate constant 
      [k(on)], 1.7x10(7) mol/L(-1) s(-1)) and reversibly (kinetic dissociation rate 
      constant [k(off)], 5x10(-3) s(-1)). By inhibiting prothrombinase complex-bound 
      (IC(50), 2.1 nmol/L) and clot-associated factor Xa (IC(50), 75 nmol/L), 
      rivaroxaban reduces the thrombin burst during the propagation phase. In animal 
      models of venous and arterial thrombosis, rivaroxaban showed dose-dependent 
      antithrombotic activity. In healthy individuals, rivaroxaban was found to have 
      predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics across a 5- to 80-mg total 
      daily dose range, inhibiting factor Xa activity and prolonging plasma clotting 
      time. In phase III clinical trials, rivaroxaban regimens reduced rates of venous 
      thromboembolism in patients after total hip or knee arthroplasty compared with 
      enoxaparin regimens, without significant differences in rates of major bleeding, 
      showing that rivaroxaban has a favorable benefit-to-risk profile.

TI  - Safety and Feasibility of Treatment with Rivaroxaban for Non-Canonical 
      Indications: A Case Series Analysis.
PG  - 857-62
LID - 10.1007/s40261-016-0436-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are used for the 
      prevention of thromboembolic complications in patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) and those at risk of deep venous thrombosis. Their rapid onset 
      of action and predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles make them 
      the optimal alternative to warfarin in the treatment of these two categories of 
      patients. Unfortunately, however, NOACs cannot be used in patients with valvular 
      AF or valvular cardiac prostheses. Although mechanical valves are effectively a 
      contraindication to NOAC use due to several pathophysiological mechanisms that 
      promote the use of warfarin rather than NOACs, few data exist regarding the use 
      of such new pharmacological compounds on patients with cardiac biological valves 
      or those who have undergone mitral repair or tubular aortic graft implantation. 
      METHODS: Our case series involved 27 patients [mean age 70 ± 10 years; mean 
      CHA2DS2-VASc (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥75 years (doubled), 
      Diabetes mellitus, Stroke/transient ischemic attack (doubled), Vascular disease, 
      Age 65-74 years, Sex category): 6 ± 1.4; and mean HAS-BLED (Hypertension, 
      Abnormal renal and liver function, Stroke, Bleeding, Labile international 
      normalized ratios, Elderly, Drugs or alcohol): 4 ± 1] with AF and biological 
      prostheses, repaired mitral valves, or tubular aortic graft who were treated with 
      the factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban due to inefficacy or adverse effects of 
      warfarin. RESULTS: The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 48 ± 9 %, the 
      left atrial diameter was 46.5 ± 7 mm, and the estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate was 45 ± 21 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The mean duration of treatment was 
      15 ± 2 months. No relevant complications or recurrent thromboembolic events 
      occurred. Three patients had recurrent nose bleeding and two had hematuria that 
      led to reduction of the rivaroxaban dose by the treating physician to 15 mg once 
      a day after 4 months of therapy. No further bleeding episode was recorded after 
      escalating the dose. CONCLUSIONS: Rivaroxaban is a valuable treatment option for 
      patients with biological prostheses, repaired mitral valves, or a tubular aortic 
      graft in order to prevent thromboembolic complications.

TI  - Safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of single doses of BAY 59-7939, an 
      oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor.
PG  - 412-21
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is a clinical need for new oral anticoagulants to 
      prevent and treat thromboembolic diseases. Given its integral role in the 
      coagulation cascade, factor Xa is a particularly promising target for new 
      anticoagulation therapies. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety, 
      pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of BAY 59--7939, an oral, direct factor Xa 
      inhibitor. METHODS: This single-center, randomized, single-blinded, 
      placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study included 108 healthy white male 
      subjects aged 19 to 45 years. Subjects received single oral doses of either BAY 
      59--7939 (1.25--80 mg) or placebo; in addition, 1 group received 2 doses of BAY 
      59--7939 (5--mg tablet and oral solution) or placebo in a crossover design. 
      RESULTS: Oral BAY 59--7939 in single doses up to 80 mg was safe and well 
      tolerated and was not associated with an increased risk of bleeding compared with 
      placebo. Pharmacodynamic effects (inhibition of factor Xa activity, prothrombin 
      time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and Hep Test) and plasma 
      concentration profiles were dose-dependent. Maximum inhibition of factor Xa 
      activity was achieved 1 to 4 hours after administration of BAY 59--7939 and 
      ranged from 20% to 61% for the 5- to 80-mg doses. BAY 59--7939 selectively 
      inhibited factor Xa activity; thrombin (factor IIa) and antithrombin were 
      unaffected. Inhibition of factor Xa activity and prolongation of prothrombin time 
      correlated well with BAY 59--7939 plasma concentrations (r=0.949 and 0.935, 
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: BAY 59--7939 was well tolerated with predictable 
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics across a wide range of doses in healthy 
      male subjects. BAY 59--7939 was shown to be an effective and specific factor Xa 
      inhibitor.

PG  - 267-275

AB  - Recent findings require an update of previous recommendations for the 
      perioperative use of Direct Oral AntiCoagulants (DOACs). A break in preoperative 
      treatment of 24-96 hours is recommended based on the pharmacokinetic profiles of 
      DOACs and depends on individual patient characteristics, their renal and possibly 
      liver function, and their surgery-related risk of bleeding. In cases of renal or 
      hepatic insufficiency, whether to extend the preoperative interruption of IIa- 
      and Xa-inhibitors is a clinical decision that must be reached on an individual 
      patient basis. In cases of epidural or spinal anaesthesia, more conservative 
      pausing-intervals are recommended due to the risk of persistent neurologic 
      deficits (e.g., paraplegia) following the development of spinal subdural and 
      epidural haematomas. Elective surgery should be postponed according to these 
      recommendations. Preoperative "bridging" with LMWH (more precisely referred to as 
      "switching") should be omitted due to a significantly increased risk of bleeding. 
      In addition, the incidence of perioperative thromboembolic risks, such as DVT, 
      PE, and stroke, are no different whether interruption or "switching" is 
      undertaken. Postoperatively, the DOACs can be reinstituted within the first 24 
      hours. In cases of major surgery or if there is a higher risk of bleeding, 
      resumption of DOACS should only begin after 24-72 hours. In patients with an 
      elevated thromboembolic risk, transient postoperative LMWH administration can be 
      recommended during this period.Interaction of DOACs with other drugs usually 
      occurs during the absorption, transport and elimination of these drugs. 
      Therefore, substance- specific restrictions and recommendations should be 
      observed during these times. In everyday clinical practice, webbased, independent 
      information portals on drug-interactions are very helpful in providing safe and 
      rapid information about potential interactions when DOACs are used in combination 
      with other drugs, especially during perioperative management.Non-adherence to 
      medications is a worldwide problem that has dangerous and costly consequences. 
      Present data suggest that persistence is the primary factor that supports 
      adherence. Despite the adherence data presented in the DOACS approval studies 
      (e.g., persistence in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism has been 
      reported to be between 94-99%), the first registries and meta-analyses provide 
      sobering results regarding the incidence of persistence and the success rate of 
      interventions designed to improve adherence with DOACs in cases of long-term 
      usage.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Drug transporters, metabolic enzymes, and renal clearance play 
      significant roles in the pharmacokinetics of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). 
      Recommendations for DOAC drug-drug interactions (DDIs) by the product labeling 
      are limited to selected CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors and lack 
      considerations for concomitant renal dysfunction. AREAS COVERED: This review 
      focuses on: 1) current recommendations for the management of pharmacokinetic DOAC 
      DDIs and the evidence used to support them; 2) alterations in DOAC exposure in 
      the setting of concomitant DDIs and mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment; 
      3) clinical outcomes associated with this combination; and 4) expert 
      recommendations for the management of pharmacokinetic DOAC DDIs. 
      English-language, full-text articles on apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and 
      edoxaban with a publication date up to 30 September 2021 were retrieved from 
      PubMed. EXPERT OPINION: Given the lack of supporting clinical data, empiric dose 
      adjustments based on pharmacokinetic data alone should be avoided. When a 
      considerable increase in a DOAC exposure is anticipated, it may be advisable to 
      use an alternative DOAC or anticoagulant from a different class. Future research 
      on identification of DOAC therapeutic ranges and target patient populations is 
      needed to inform clinical utility of DOAC level monitoring to guide the 
      management of DDIs.

TI  - Measuring Rivaroxaban in a clinical laboratory setting, using common coagulation

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban, a direct Xa inhibitor, is one of the new oral 
      antithrombotic agents for which laboratory monitoring is thought to be 
      unnecessary in most cases due to predictable pharmacokinetics. Circumstances are 
      conceivable, however, in which reliable laboratory testing of Rivaroxaban is 
      desirable. The aim of the present in vitro study was to investigate and compare 
      the analytical and practical use of Rivaroxaban monitoring with routine screening 
      assays, thrombin generation and anti-Xa activity, in a clinical laboratory 
      setting. METHODS: Rivaroxaban was added to nine normal donor plasmas and to a 
      normal pooled plasma in concentrations up to 1000 μg/L. Prothrombin time (PT), 
      activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) 
      and anti-Xa activity were measured in all donor samples. Responsiveness to 
      Rivaroxaban and imprecision of Rivaroxaban recovery were assessed. RESULTS: Low 
      intra-, but high inter-individual imprecision was found for PT displaying a 
      linear dose-response relationship. Imprecision was much lower when directly 
      measuring anti-Xa activity. Responsiveness of ETP lag-time was high, but of total 
      thrombin generation was low, illustrating that the main effect of Rivaroxaban Xa 
      inhibition lies in delaying thrombin formation rather than in preventing it. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite a high inter-individual imprecision of the PT, this 
      relatively fast and cost-friendly assay is sensitive to Rivaroxaban and 
      integrates its effects on the global coagulant state of patients. Anti-Xa 
      activity assays can be run to assess the actual Rivaroxaban concentration and in 
      the future ETP could serve as a fine-tuned hemostatic balance indicator for 
      patients using Rivaroxaban.

TI  - Absence of both MDR1 (ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2) 
      transporters significantly alters rivaroxaban disposition and central nervous 
      system entry.
PG  - 164-70
LID - 10.1111/bcpt.12005 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is a novel factor 10a inhibitor, where hepatic metabolism and renal 
      clearance account for its overall disposition. Renal impairment is known to 
      increase rivaroxaban-associated bleeding risk in patients. As renal rivaroxaban 
      clearance exceeds glomerular filtration rate, we suggested that active secretion 
      by efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (MDR1) and breast cancer resistance protein 
      (BCRP) contributes to rivaroxaban clearance. The ability of MDR1 and BCRP efflux 
      transporters to mediate rivaroxaban transport in vitro was assessed in polarized 
      cell monolayers. A significantly greater vectorial transport of rivaroxaban was 
      observed in the basal to apical direction in Caco-2 cells, which was attenuated 
      in the presence of the selective inhibitors. After oral administration of 
      rivaroxaban (2 mg/kg), plasma concentrations did not significantly differ between 
      wild-type and Mdr1a(def) or Bcrp(-/-) mice (n = 6 per group). However, 
      rivaroxaban clearance was significantly reduced in Mdr1a/Mdr1b(-/-)/Bcrp(-/-) 
      mice. Interestingly, rivaroxaban brain-to-plasma ratio did not differ in mice 
      lacking only Mdr1a or Bcrp, but more than two times higher in the 
      Mdr1a/Mdr1b(-/-)/Bcrp(-/-) mice. Rivaroxaban is a shared substrate of MDR1 and 
      BCRP. In vivo, MDR and BCRP function synergistically to modulate rivaroxaban 
      disposition and appear to be particularly relevant to limiting its central 
      nervous system entry. These data have important implications for safety and 
      efficacy of anticoagulation therapy with rivaroxaban as many drugs in clinical 
      use are known MDR1 inhibitors and loss-of-function polymorphisms in BCRP are 
      common.

TI  - Toward Genetic Testing of Rivaroxaban? Insights from a Systematic Review on the 
      Role of Genetic Polymorphism in Rivaroxaban Therapy.
PG  - 279-291
LID - 10.1007/s40262-024-01358-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Investigations into the rivaroxaban response from the perspective of 
      genetic variation have been relatively recent and wide in scope, whereas there is 
      no consensus on the necessity of genetic testing of rivaroxaban. Thus, this 
      systematic review aims to thoroughly evaluate the relationship between genetic 
      polymorphisms and rivaroxaban outcomes. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Chinese databases were 
      searched to 23 October 2022. We included cohort studies reporting the 
      pharmacogenetic correlation of rivaroxaban. Outcomes measured included efficacy 
      (all-cause mortality, thromboembolic events and coagulation-related tests), 
      safety (major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding [CRNMB] and any 
      hemorrhage), and pharmacokinetic outcomes. A narrative synthesis was performed to 
      summarize findings from individual studies according to the Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and the reporting guideline for 
      Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies published between 
      2019 and 2022 involving 1364 patients were included. Ten, one, and six studies 
      focused on the ABCB1, ABCG2, and CYP gene polymorphisms, respectively. 
      Pharmacokinetic outcomes accounted for the majority of the outcomes reported 
      (n = 11), followed by efficacy (n = 5) [including prothrombin time (PT) or 
      international normalized ratio (n = 3), platelet inhibition rate (PIR) or 
      platelet reactivity units (PRUs; n = 1), thromboembolic events (n = 1)], and 
      safety (n = 5) [including major bleeding (n = 2), CRNMB (n = 2), any hemorrhage 
      (n = 1)]. For ABCB1 gene polymorphism, the relationship between PT and ABCB1 
      rs1045642 was inconsistent across studies, however there was no pharmacogenetic 
      relationship with other efficacy outcomes. Safety associations were found in 
      ABCB1 rs4148738 and major bleeding, ABCB1 rs4148738 and CRNMB, ABCB1 rs1045642 
      and CRNMB, and ABCB1 rs2032582 and hemorrhage. Pharmacokinetic results were 
      inconsistent among studies. For ABCG2 gene polymorphism, no correlation was 
      observed between ABCG2 rs2231142 and dose-adjusted trough concentration 
      (C(min)/D). For CYP gene polymorphisms, PIR or PRUs have a relationship with 
      CYP2C19 rs12248560, however bleeding or pharmacokinetic effects did not show 
      similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available data are insufficient to 
      confirm the relationship between clinical or pharmacokinetic outcomes of 
      rivaroxaban and gene polymorphisms. Proactive strategies are advised as a 
      priority in clinical practice rather than detection of SNP genotyping. CLINICAL 
      TRIALS REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration number CRD42022347907.

TI  - Direct oral anticoagulants: a guide for daily practice.
PG  - w14286
LID - 10.4414/smw.2016.14286 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, small oral compounds that specifically block activated 
      coagulation factor X (FXa) or thrombin (FIIa) have become alternatives to the 
      anticoagulants that had been used for several decades. As of today, these direct 
      oral anticoagulants (DOACs) include dabigatran etexilate (thrombin inhibitor) and 
      apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban (inhibitors of FXa). While there is no doubt 
      that DOACs represent a major step forward in the management of patients with 
      venous thromboembolic disease and atrial fibrillation, new challenges have 
      arisen. They need to be addressed with the necessary pragmatism on the basis of 
      evidence. Indeed, a better understanding of the management of these 
      last-generation antithrombotics will favour safer use and increase confidence of 
      the practitioner for the prescription of these drugs. The aim of this article is 
      to present practical suggestions for the prescription and use of these drugs in 
      everyday clinical practice, based on clinical experience and recently updated 
      recommendations of the European Heart Rhythm Association and the American College 
      of Chest Physicians among other scientific organisations. We address issues such 
      as pharmacokinetics, dosing, side effects, limitations of use, drug interactions, 
      switching from and to other anticoagulants, renal function, concomitant 
      administration of antiplatelet agents and perioperative use. We also address the 
      issue of monitoring and reversal, taking advantage of the most recent development 
      in this latter area. Rather than being one additional set of recommendations, our 
      narrative review aims at assisting the practicing physician in his or her daily 
      handling of these novel anticoagulant compounds, based on frequently asked 
      questions to the authors, a group of experienced specialists in the field who 
      have, however, no commitment to issue guidelines.

TI  - Model-Based Risk Prediction of Rivaroxaban with Amiodarone for Moderate Renal 
      Impaired Elderly Population.
PG  - 605-609
LID - 10.1007/s10557-021-07266-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Increased bleeding risk was found associated with concurrent 
      prescription of rivaroxaban and amiodarone. We previously recommended dose 
      adjustment for rivaroxaban utilizing a physiologically based pharmacokinetic 
      (PBPK) modeling approach. Our subsequent in vitro studies discovered the pivotal 
      involvement of human renal organic anion transporter 3 (hOAT3) in the renal 
      secretion of rivaroxaban and the inhibitory potency of amiodarone. This study 
      aimed to redefine the disease-drug-drug interactions (DDDI) between rivaroxaban 
      and amiodarone and update the potential risks. METHODS: Prospective simulations 
      were conducted with updated PBPK models of rivaroxaban and amiodarone 
      incorporating hOAT3-related parameters. RESULTS: Simulations to recapitulate 
      previously explored DDDI in renal impairment showed a higher bleeding tendency in 
      all simulation scenarios after integrating hOAT3-mediated clearance into PBPK 
      models. Further sensitivity analysis revealed that both hOAT3 dysfunction and age 
      could affect the extent of DDDI, and age was shown to have a more pivotal role on 
      rivaroxaban in vivo exposure. When amiodarone was prescribed along with our 
      recommended dose reduction of rivaroxaban to 10 mg in moderate renal impaired 
      elderly people, it could result in persistently higher rivaroxaban peak 
      concentrations at a steady state. To better manage the increased bleeding risk 
      among such a vulnerable population, a dose reduction of rivaroxaban to 2.5 mg 
      twice daily resulted in its acceptable in vivo exposure. CONCLUSION: Close 
      monitoring of bleeding tendency is essential for elderly patients with moderate 
      renal impairment receiving co-prescribed rivaroxaban and amiodarone. Further dose 
      reduction is recommended for rivaroxaban to mitigate this specific DDDI risk.

TI  - Rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing major orthopedic 
      surgery.
PG  - 1061-71
LID - 10.1345/aph.1M681 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical 
      efficacy/safety profile of rivaroxaban to inform health-care professionals of 
      this new agent for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients 
      undergoing major orthopedic surgery. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was 
      performed in PubMed/MEDLINE (1966-March 2010), International Pharmaceutical 
      Abstracts (1970-March 2010), and EMBASE (1990-March 2010), limited to 
      publications in English, using the search terms BAY 59-7939, rivaroxaban, factor 
      Xa inhibitor, hip replacement, and/or knee replacement to identify literature 
      sources. References from retrieved articles were evaluated to identify relevant 
      literature. Unpublished Phase 3 clinical trials in progress (using 
      www.clinicaltrials.gov) were also reviewed. The Food and Drug Administration, 
      European Medicines Agency, and Health Canada Web sites were used to retrieve 
      product monographs, regulatory guidance, and advisory committee briefing packets. 
      STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All available studies relevant to the 
      pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical safety/efficacy of rivaroxaban for 
      the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery were 
      included, with preference for clinical data. DATA SYNTHESIS: Rivaroxaban use was 
      significantly more effective for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing total 
      knee replacement (TKR) or total hip replacement (THR), compared to enoxaparin for 
      the composite incidence of deep vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, 
      all-cause mortality, and the rate of major VTE; bleeding events occurred at 
      statistically similar rates. In Phase 3 studies, rivaroxaban 10 mg was 
      administered orally 6-8 hours post-surgery and post-hemostasis. Thereafter, 
      administration was once daily for 35 days in THR and 10-14 days in TKR. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Rivaroxaban has demonstrated comparable safety and superior efficacy 
      to the commonly used low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxaparin. Ongoing and future 
      clinical trials will allow clinicians to further assess the efficacy, safety, and 
      pharmacoeconomics of rivaroxaban.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are nonvitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) approved for stroke prevention in patients 
      with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Phase-3 clinical trials demonstrated 
      NOACs were as effective as warfarin in the prevention of stroke or systemic 
      embolism and associated with decreased incidences of intracranial bleeding. 
      Additionally, NOACs provide quicker onset of action, simpler dosing, more 
      predictable pharmacokinetic profiles, and decreased food and drug interactions 
      compared with warfarin. Despite the advantages of NOACs, the lack of knowledge 
      may limit their use in clinical practice. METHODS: A search was performed on the 
      terms 'atrial fibrillation' and 'dabigatran', 'apixaban', 'edoxaban', or 
      'rivaroxaban' to identify relevant papers; large randomized clinical trials, 
      meta-analyses, and treatment guideline recommendations were given preference. 
      Searches to identify registries, treatment guidelines, and meta-analyses relevant 
      to patient subgroups were also employed. RESULTS: Dosing recommendations, 
      initiation of treatment, and applications in patients who undergo NVAF 
      procedures, have mechanical heart valves, or experience other cardiovascular 
      conditions such as myocardial infarction, previous stroke, and valvular heart 
      disease are summarized. The NOAC-specific reversal approaches are also discussed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Several important factors should be considered regarding the 
      adequate use of NOACs, especially in patients with renal impairment or 
      cardiovascular conditions other than NVAF.

AB  - A high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric method for the 
      determination of Rivaroxaban in human plasma has been developed and validated 
      using Rivaroxaban D(4) as an internal standard. The extraction of analyte and 
      internal standard was accomplished by solid phase extraction technique. The 
      method has been validated over a concentration range of 5.96-801 ng/mL. 
      Chromatographic separations were achieved using Gemini C18, 150 mm × 4.6 mm, 
      5 µm, column eluted at flow rate of 1.5 mL/min with mobile phase (acetonitrile: 
      ammonium acetate buffer (80:20 v/v)). The overall run time of method was about 
      1.8 min with elution times of Rivaroxaban and its internal standard Rivaroxaban 
      D(4) at around 1.18 min. The multiple reaction monitoring transitions were set at 
      436/145 (m/z) and 440/145 (m/z) for Rivaroxaban and Rivaroxaban D(4), 
      respectively. The calibration curves were linear (r(2 )≥ 0.99) over the range of 
      5.96-801 ng/mL with lower limit of quantitation validated at 5.96 ng/mL. 
      Extraction recoveries were >88% for both rivaroxaban and its stable labeled 
      internal standard rivaroxaban D(4). The inter-day/between run precisions were 
      ranged from 1.08% to 3.75%, while accuracy ranged from 96.3% to 102%. The 
      presented method was used in pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers. Results 
      of incurred sample reanalysis were within the acceptance range of ±20% of 
      original value, for 98.3% of samples reanalyzed. This indicated good assay 
      precision of target analytes in their real matrix at the employed experimental 
      conditions. The applicability of the assay for the determination of the 
      pharmacokinetic parameters was demonstrated.

TI  - Using a low-molecular weight heparin-calibrated anti-factor Xa assay to assess 
      the concentration of apixaban and rivaroxaban.
PG  - 163-167
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.13692 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)-inhibiting factor Xa (FXa-DOAC) 
      are being increasingly used as prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism and for 
      prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. In contrast to vitamin 
      K antagonists, DOACs do not require monitoring in general. However, it is 
      sometimes of value in the acute setting, for instance when considering a reversal 
      agent in uncontrolled bleeding in patients on DOAC. METHODS: We evaluated if a 
      low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH)-calibrated anti-factor Xa assay could be used 
      to estimate FXa-DOAC concentration in the concentration range <100 ng/mL by 
      spiking known concentrations of FXa-DOAC and from those result calculate the 
      FXa-DOAC concentration from the response of the LMWH assay. This procedure was 
      then evaluated by comparing the result with a drug-calibrated chromogenic assay 
      and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on clinical plasma 
      samples from patients treated with apixaban or rivaroxaban. RESULTS: Although the 
      measuring range was narrower for the LMWH-calibrated assay, concentrations 
      recalculated from the LMWH assay was comparable with those measured by the 
      drug-calibrated method when compared with LC-MS/MS. CONCLUSION: We suggest that 
      an LMWH-calibrated anti-factor Xa assay can be used after characterization of the 
      response of FXa-DOACs to give guidance on the concentration of apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban. Shorter turnaround time than LC-MS/MS and the greater availability 
      than drug-calibrated chromogenic assays could make this a valuable option in the 
      acute setting.

TI  - The influence of feeding and gastroprotectant medications on the Factor Xa 
      inhibitory activity of orally administered rivaroxaban in normal dogs.
PG  - 59-65
LID - 10.1111/vec.13019 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rivaroxaban is a new anticoagulant option for dogs, yet its reported 
      oral bioavailability is as low as 60%. The objective of this study was to examine 
      the influence of feeding and gastroprotectant medications on the bioactivity 
      (anti-Xa activity) of rivaroxaban in healthy dogs. DESIGN: Prospective 
      experimental study. SETTING: University research laboratory. ANIMALS: Five 
      healthy neutered male purpose-bred Beagles. INTERVENTIONS: Dogs were administered 
      a median dose of 1.8 mg/kg rivaroxaban (range, 1.6-1.8 mg/kg) orally once daily 
      for 2 consecutive days with either (1) no food, (2) food, (3) sucralfate 30 
      minutes before rivaroxaban, or (4) omeprazole at the same time as rivaroxaban. 
      Blood was collected from preplaced jugular catheters immediately before and at 6 
      time points after rivaroxaban administration (2, 4, 8, 24, 36, and 48 hours). A 
      rivaroxaban calibrated anti-Xa activity assay (RIVA) was used to monitor 
      anticoagulant effect. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Rivaroxaban administration 
      resulted in significant increases in RIVA (P = 0.02), with peak activities 
      occurring 2 to 4 hours after dosingduring each study arm. No feeding was 
      associated with significantly higher RIVA at the 36-hour time point compared to 
      all other treatment arms (P < 0.0001), and feeding resulted in high RIVA at the 
      48-hour time point compared with sucralfate administration (P = 0.003). No 
      significant changes in RIVA were otherwise identified with respect to feeding or 
      gastroprotectant administration (P = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: 
      Although administration without food demonstrated an apparent increase in RIVA 
      36 hours after drug administration, clinically relevant differences among 
      treatment groups were not identified in combined analyses of time points. Based 
      on these results, dogs treated with rivaroxaban do not require special 
      modification of feeding practices or gastroprotectant drug administration.

TI  - New anticoagulants for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism.
PG  - 373-82
AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major public health issue, with a high 
      incidence in hospitalised patients. Furthermore, many VTE events are preventable 
      with appropriate thromboprophylaxis. Medical thromboprophylaxis usually comprises 
      heparins, while warfarin has been the mainstay of long term anticoagulation for 
      many years. Both drugs are limited by their narrow therapeutic index and the need 
      for regular monitoring. The introduction of low molecular weight heparins and 
      fondaparinux has overcome some of these shortfalls but their use remains 
      restricted by requisite parenteral administration. There is a clear need for new 
      anticoagulants with predictable pharmacokinetics and anticoagulant effect. To 
      this end, 2 new agents; dabigatran and rivaroxaban, have recently been licensed 
      for use in orthopaedic thromboprophylaxis. This review discusses the limitations 
      of traditional anticoagulants, and summarises the development and clinical 
      studies pertaining to the use of 3 new targeted anticoagulants: idraparinux, 
      rivaroxaban and dabigatran in VTE, in addition to the limitations of these novel 
      agents.

AB  - Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is a new oral, direct and selective inhibitor of the factor 
      Xa of the coagulation cascade. The main pharmacokinetic characteristics of 
      rivaroxaban are a bioavailability of approximately 80-100%, a maximum 
      concentration obtained in 2 to 4 hours, a terminal half-life of elimination of 7 
      to 11 hours, a renal elimination for 1/3 for the active hepatic metabolism from 
      the cytochrome P450 (3A4) for the other 2/3. The main sources of variability are 
      the renal and the liver function and potential interactions with some strong 
      inhibitors or inducers of the CYP450 3A4. Phase II clinical studies have shown 
      that this compound can be orally administrated, once or twice daily, without any 
      biological monitoring and without any need for dose adjustment. There is a 
      contra-indication in case of severe liver insufficiency and not recommended in 
      case of severe renal impairment. Pharmacodynamically, Rivaroxaban is a direct and 
      selective factor Xa inhibitor without any effect on the factor IIa and without 
      any interaction on platelets. Four phases II with 2787 patients were carried out 
      to for venous thromboembolic (VTE) prophylaxis after major orthopaedic surgery, 
      showing that 10 mg once daily could be the optimal dose regimen to assess in 
      phase III. Two phases II with 1446 patients were carried out for the treatment of 
      VTE showing that 15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks and then 20 mg once daily could be 
      the optimal dose regimen to evaluate in the following phases 3. No strong signal 
      for a potential liver toxicity was shown during these 6 phases II.

TI  - Pharmacogenetics of novel oral anticoagulants: a review of identified gene 
      variants & future perspectives.
PG  - 209-221
LID - 10.2217/pme-2017-0092 [doi]
AB  - Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are becoming a therapy of choice in everyday 
      clinical practice after almost 50 years during which warfarin and related 
      coumarin derivatives were used as the main anticoagulants. Advantages of NOACs 
      over standard anticoagulants include their predictable pharmacodynamics and 
      pharmacokinetics, stable plasma concentrations and less drug-drug and food-drug 
      interactions. However, pharmacogenetics has its place in administration of NOACs, 
      as considerable interindividual variations have been detected. In this review, 
      previous findings in pharmacogenetics of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban are summarized, along with recommendations for studying genes encoding 
      metabolically important enzymes for four selected NOACs. Future directions 
      include identification of clinically relevant SNPs, and change in optimum dosage 
      for patients who are carriers of significant variants.

TI  - Time Course of the Interaction Between Oral Short-Term Ritonavir Therapy with 
      Three Factor Xa Inhibitors and the Activity of CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 in 
      Healthy Volunteers.
PG  - 469-481
LID - 10.1007/s40262-024-01350-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the effect of a 5-day low-dose ritonavir therapy, as 
      it is used in the treatment of COVID-19 with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, on the 
      pharmacokinetics of three factor Xa inhibitors (FXaI). Concurrently, the time 
      course of the activities of the cytochromes P450 (CYP) 3A4, 2C19, and 2D6 was 
      assessed. METHODS: In an open-label, fixed sequence clinical trial, the effect 
      and duration of a 5-day oral ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) treatment on the 
      pharmacokinetics of three oral microdosed FXaI (rivaroxaban 25 µg, apixaban 
      25 µg, and edoxaban 50 µg) and microdosed probe drugs (midazolam 25 µg, yohimbine 
      50 µg, and omeprazole 100 µg) was evaluated in eight healthy volunteers. The 
      plasma concentrations of all drugs were quantified using validated liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods and pharmacokinetics 
      were analysed using non-compartmental analyses. RESULTS: Ritonavir increased the 
      exposure of apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, but to a different extent the 
      observed area under the plasma concentration-time curve (geometric mean ratio 
      1.29, 1.46, and 1.87, respectively). A strong CYP3A4 inhibition (geometric mean 
      ratio > 10), a moderate CYP2C19 induction 2 days after ritonavir (0.64), and no 
      alteration of CYP2D6 were observed. A CYP3A4 recovery half-life of 2.3 days was 
      determined. CONCLUSION: This trial with three microdosed FXaI suggests that at 
      most the rivaroxaban dose should be reduced during short-term ritonavir, and only 
      in patients receiving high maintenance doses. Thorough time series analyses 
      demonstrated differential effects on three different drug-metabolising enzymes 
      over time with immediate profound inhibition of CYP3A4 and only slow recovery 
      after discontinuation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT number: 
      2021-006643-39.

TI  - Influence of direct oral anticoagulants on thrombin generation on Ceveron TGA.
PG  - 193-201
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.13721 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Monitoring of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) with calibrated 
      anti-Xa assay is limited by the high intra- and interindividual variations of the 
      test results. Thrombin generation (TG) is a global hemostatic assay that reflects 
      the patient´s individual coagulation status. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the influence of DOACs on TG measured with a fully automated assay 
      system. METHODS: All consecutive patients under apixaban and rivaroxaban coming 
      to the outpatient coagulation center MVZ Limbach, Magdeburg, Germany between 
      October 2017 and April 2020 were included. DOAC plasma levels were correlated 
      with TG assessed using the fully automated Ceveron TG analyzer. RESULTS: A total 
      of 703 rivaroxaban and 252 apixaban containing plasma samples were included. 
      There was a significant correlation between DOAC plasma levels and all TG 
      parameters except for lag time regarding apixaban. Time to peak and peak thrombin 
      followed an exponential regression curve, while this was linear for the 
      endogenous thrombin potential (ETP). Apixaban showed a lower correlation 
      coefficient for all TG parameters compared with rivaroxaban, and thrombin 
      generation was less influenced by apixaban than rivaroxaban at plasma levels 
      >100 ng/ml. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of normal TG parameters 
      for the prediction of DOAC plasma levels <30 ng/ml was >85%. CONCLUSION: The 
      present data show a moderate predominantly nonlinear correlation between TG 
      parameters and plasma levels of apixaban and rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban has a 
      stronger effect on TG than apixaban.

TI  - [Monitoring of NOAC].
PG  - 92-98
LID - 10.1007/s00063-016-0249-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monitoring non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) is 
      usually not necessary; however, in some patients it may prove beneficial. 
      OBJECTIVES: Patient subgroups who may profit from monitoring were identified, and 
      methods of monitoring (including assessment of which coagulation parameters are 
      affected by NOAC) are described. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the PubMed 
      database for each of the search terms, "NOAC", "DOAC", "rivaroxaban", 
      "dabigatran", and "apixaban", in combination with one of the terms, "monitoring", 
      "measurement", "measuring", or "assessment". The results were compiled and 
      reviewed. RESULTS: Monitoring is most advantageous in emergency cases with severe 
      bleeding where drug activity needs to be assessed. It can also help in deciding 
      for or against lysis therapy after acute stroke in patients taking NOAC. 
      Furthermore, it can also identify compliance problems and help in planning 
      periprocedural management. There are quantitative measurement methods which 
      measure plasma concentrations exactly and qualitative methods which only allow 
      for a rough estimate or a general confirmation of drug activity. Recommended 
      quantitative measurement methods are diluted thrombin time for dabigatran, and 
      anti-factor Xa activity (calibrated) for rivaroxaban and apixaban. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Several patient subgroups may profit from monitoring of NOAC plasma 
      concentration. One should, however, take several issues into consideration before 
      measurements, such as the objective of each individual measurement, possible 
      consequences (e. g., dose adjustment), and which measurement method to pick.

      implications.
PG  - 78-86

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban are approved novel 
      oral anticoagulants (NOACs) as alternatives to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA). 
      Physicians are prescribing an ever-increasing amount these drugs to their 
      patients due to various advantages over existing medications. AIMS: The objective 
      of this review is to provide the dental professional with current literature 
      surrounding the emergence of NOACs, as well as various case studies on the 
      subject, in an effort to guide clinical decision making regarding these 
      medications. The pharmacological profiles of these NOACs and idarucizumab, a 
      reversal agent for dabigatran, will be detailed in this review. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A review of the literature on NOACs was undertaken and the Pubmed, 
      Medline, and Embase databases were used to identify articles published in the 
      English language. Additionally, major dental medicine journals were hand 
      searched, followed by a review of the ClinicalTrials.gov database. RESULTS: Due 
      to minimal research regarding dental treatment of patients on NOACs and minimal 
      clinical experience of practitioners treating these patients, there is currently 
      insufficient data to establish an evidence-based NOAC management protocol in a 
      dental setting. DISCUSSION: In this review, the most significant advantages of 
      NOACs over VKAs was found to be limited interactions with other drugs as well as 
      rapid onset and offset of action. CONCLUSION: Despite these benefits, as well as 
      various others, NOACs still lack specific management parameters as well as 
      antidotes or reversal agents. Therefore, dental professionals must use caution 
      when treating patients currently taking these specific anticoagulants.

TI  - Rivaroxaban: an oral direct inhibitor of factor Xa.
PG  - 1520-9
LID - 10.2146/ajhp070624 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy in 
      clinical trials, interactions, adverse effects and toxicity, and place in therapy 
      of rivaroxaban are reviewed. SUMMARY: Rivaroxaban, the first oral, direct factor 
      Xa (FXa) inhibitor to reach Phase III trials, inhibits thrombin generation by 
      both the intrinsic and the tissue factor pathways. It has shown predictable, 
      reversible inhibition of FXa activity, and it may have the ability to inhibit 
      clot-bound FXa. Rivaroxaban is being evaluated for prevention of venous 
      thrombosis in patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty, treatment of venous 
      thrombosis, long-term use for secondary prevention of venous thrombosis, and 
      prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation. To date, only short-term trials have 
      been reported, but rivaroxaban's safety and efficacy appear to be at least 
      equivalent to those of traditional anticoagulants. The results of four studies of 
      primary prevention of venous thrombosis in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery 
      suggest that rivaroxaban 10 mg daily is a promising alternative to 
      low-molecular-weight heparins. Rivaroxaban appears to have a low potential for 
      drug-drug or drug-food interactions. It offers the advantages of a fixed oral 
      dose, rapid onset of action, and predictable and consistent anticoagulation 
      effect, precluding the need for routine monitoring of anticoagulation. 
      CONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban is a promising alternative to traditional anticoagulants 
      for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism and for stroke 
      prevention in atrial fibrillation; it offers once-daily oral administration 
      without the need for routine monitoring.

TI  - Application of physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling to the prediction 
      of drug-drug and drug-disease interactions for rivaroxaban.
PG  - 755-765
LID - 10.1007/s00228-018-2430-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Rivaroxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant with a large inter-individual 
      variability. The present study is to develop a physiologically based 
      pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict several scenarios in clinical practice. 
      METHODS: A whole-body PBPK model for rivaroxaban, which is metabolized by the 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5, 2J2 pathways and excreted via kidneys, was developed 
      to predict the pharmacokinetics at different doses in healthy subjects and 
      patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. Hepatic clearance and drug-drug 
      interactions (DDI) were estimated by in vitro in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) based 
      on parameters obtained from in vitro experiments. To validate the model, observed 
      concentrations were compared with predicted concentrations, and the impact of 
      special scenarios was investigated. RESULTS: The PBPK model successfully 
      predicted the pharmacokinetics for healthy subjects and patients as well as DDIs. 
      Sensitivity analysis shows that age, renal, and hepatic clearance are important 
      factors affecting rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics. The predicted fold increase of 
      rivaroxaban AUC values when combined administered with the inhibitors such as 
      ketoconazole, ritonavir, and clarithromycin were 2.3, 2.2, and 1.3, respectively. 
      When DDIs and hepatic dysfunction coexist, the fold increase of rivaroxaban 
      exposure would increase significantly compared with one factor alone. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study using PBPK modeling provided a reasonable approach to 
      evaluate exposure levels in special patients under special scenarios. Although 
      further clinical study or real-life experience would certainly merit the current 
      work, the modeling work so far would at least suggest caution of using 
      rivaroxaban in complicated clinical settings.

AB  - Anticoagulation in patients with impaired kidney function can be challenging 
      since drugs' pharmacokinetics and bioavailability are altered in this setting. 
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) treated with conventional 
      anticoagulant agents [vitamin K antagonist (VKA), low-molecular weight heparin 
      (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH)] are at high risk of bleeding events (both 
      non-major and major clinically relevant bleeding). While anticoagulation reduces 
      the risk of thromboembolic events, the co-existing bleeding risk and the fact 
      that the most commonly used anticoagulation agents are eliminated via the kidneys 
      pose additional challenges. More recently, two classes of direct oral 
      anticoagulant agents (DOACs) have been investigated for the prevention and 
      management of venous thromboembolic events: the direct factor Xa inhibitors 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban, and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. 
      In this review, we discuss the complex challenges and the practical 
      considerations associated with the management of anticoagulation treatment in 
      patients with CKD, with a special focus on DOACs.

      Disposition of Calcineurin Inhibitors in Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 77-82
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000356 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      share certain metabolic pathways, but whether DOACs influence CNI exposure has 
      not been assessed. METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis was performed 
      including 39 organ recipients treated with the combination of a CNI and 
      rivaroxaban (n = 29) or apixaban (n = 10). Dose-corrected CNI trough 
      concentrations (C0/D) during 200 days before and after DOAC initiation were 
      recorded (n = 261), together with covariates known to influence CNI disposition 
      such as steroid dose and hematocrit. The average C0/D before and during DOAC 
      therapy was compared using paired samples t test. Multivariable mixed models were 
      constructed to estimate the effect of DOAC and other predictors on C0/D at each 
      time point. RESULTS: Group average C0/D was not significantly different before 
      and during DOAC therapy for any CNI-DOAC combination (P = 0.089-0.761), although 
      C0/D changed >20% in 19/39 patients (13 increases, 6 decreases). In multivariable 
      analysis, independent predictors of tacrolimus C0/D were methylprednisolone dose 
      (P = 0.039) and concomitant use of a CYP3A inhibitor (P = 0.007). The subgroup 
      analysis per DOAC showed a limited but significant effect of rivaroxaban on 
      tacrolimus C0/D (9.2% increase, P = 0.042). Independent predictors of ciclosporin 
      C0/D were age (P = 0.018) and use of any DOAC (12.1% increase, P = 0.020). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban, and particularly rivaroxaban, may cause a limited (<20%) 
      increase in CNI trough concentration, an effect that is unlikely to trigger a 
      dose change. It may be prudent to perform an additional CNI trough concentration 
      measurement 5-7 days after DOAC initiation, but preemptive CNI dose changes are 
      not warranted based on these observations.

TI  - In Vitro Assessment of Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interactions of Direct Oral 
      Anticoagulants: Type 5-Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors Are Inhibitors of Rivaroxaban 
      and Apixaban Efflux by P-Glycoprotein.
PG  - 519-525
LID - 10.1124/jpet.117.245993 [doi]
AB  - Because of their lower bleeding risk and simplicity of use, direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) could represent an interesting alternative to conventional 
      anticoagulant treatment with vitamin K antagonists for patients with pulmonary 
      arterial hypertension (PAH). P-glycoprotein (P-gp) plays a key role in DOAC 
      pharmacokinetics. Type 5-phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE5is), a drug class 
      commonly used in the treatment of PAH, have been shown to strongly inhibit P-gp. 
      This work aimed to assess potential P-gp-mediated drug-drug interactions between 
      PDE5is and DOACs using in vitro methods. A cellular model of drug transport 
      assay, using P-gp-overexpressing Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (transfected 
      with the human P-gp gene), was used to determine the bidirectional permeabilities 
      of two DOACs (rivaroxaban and apixaban) in the absence and presence of increasing 
      concentrations (0.5-100 µM) of three PDE5is (sildenafil, tadalafil, and 
      vardenafil). Permeabilities and efflux ratios were calculated from DOAC 
      concentrations, were measured with liquid chromatography coupled with mass 
      spectrometry, and were subsequently used to determine the PDE5i percentage of 
      inhibition and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50) ). Rivaroxaban 
      efflux was inhibited by 99%, 66%, and 100% with 100 µM sildenafil, tadalafil, and 
      vardenafil, respectively. Similarly, apixaban efflux was inhibited by 97%, 74%, 
      and 100%, respectively. The IC(50) values of the three PDE5is were 8, 28, and 5 
      µM for rivaroxaban and 23, 15, and 3 µM for apixaban, respectively. This study 
      showed strong in vitro inhibition of DOAC efflux by PDE5is. In vivo studies are 
      required to determine the clinical relevance of these interactions.

AB  - Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) available for the treatment and prevention of 
      thromboembolic diseases include dabigatran, a direct thrombin (IIa) inhibitor, 
      and apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, which are direct inhibitors of Stuart 
      factor (Xa). DOACs have a different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics 
      profiles, with less probable drug-drug interactions than vitamin K antagonists. 
      They do not require systematic therapeutic monitoring except in specific clinical 
      situations such as emergency procedures or drug non-compliance. Furthermore, 
      anticoagulant effects of DOACs could be impacted by renal impairment, drug-drug 
      interactions, food interactions, or pharmacogenetic variability. In this context, 
      we developed a method for simultaneous determination of dabigatran, rivaroxaban 
      and apixaban in human plasma using high performance liquid chromatography coupled 
      with a mass spectrometry assay and applied it to 26 patient samples. Our method 
      presents a total run time of 5 min and extends from 25 to 1000 μg/L for apixaban 
      and dabigatran; and from 5 to 1000 μg/L for rivaroxaban. Intra- and inter-assay 
      accuracy were between -22.3 and 25.4%; and - 23.7 and 3.8%, respectively. 
      Precision at low and high concentrations were below 17.5%. Frozen samples were 
      stable up to 3 months. No significant cross-contamination was observed. In 
      conclusion, our assay can be used during clinical studies and in daily routine 
      practice for the management of specific clinical situations at reasonable cost.

      in vitro and in vivo evaluation.
PG  - 316-327
LID - 10.1080/10837450.2020.1870237 [doi]
AB  - In this study, chitosan (CS) caged classic liposomes (CLs) and flexible liposomes 
      (FLs) were developed to enhance the oral bioavailability of rivaroxaban (RVX) in 
      the fasted condition. The prepared formulations were subjected to physicochemical 
      characterization included: FTIR, DSC, zeta potential, particle size, 
      polydispersity index, entrapment efficiency, in vitro dissolution, and 
      transmission electron microscope imaging. The selected formulation (RVX-TFL2) 
      composed of PL S100/Tween 80 (85/15% w/w) and coated with CS solution in the 
      strength of (0.2% w/v) had a particle size of 105.67 nm, a zeta potential of 
      +5.67 mV and EE of 96.07%. Compared to RXV suspension, the pharmacokinetic 
      parameters (C (max), AUC(0-24), and AUC(0-∞)) of RVX-TFL2 showed no statistically 
      significant difference (P > 0.05) in the fasted and fed test animals. Besides, 
      RVX bioavailability with RVX-TFL2 was improved by 59.66% and 26.97% in the fed 
      and fasted states, respectively, compared to RVX suspension in the fed state. The 
      result highlighted the efficacy of the prepared liquid formulation comprising CS 
      coated liposomes in improving the oral bioavailability of RVX regardless of the 
      fed state. Moreover, the studied liquid formulation could be utilized in 
      developing a liquid dosage form that might be useful as a pediatric formulation 
      of RVX.

PG  - 249
LID - 10.1186/s13054-016-1413-3 [doi]
LID - 249
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, a new generation of direct-acting oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) with a greater specificity towards activated coagulation factors was 
      introduced based on encouraging results for efficacy and safety in clinical 
      studies. An initial limitation of these new drugs was the absence of an adequate 
      strategy to reverse the effect if a bleeding event occurs or an urgent invasive 
      procedure has to be carried out. MAIN TEXT: Specific reversing agents for DOACs 
      have become available, however, and are now evaluated in clinical studies. For 
      the anti-factor Xa agents (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) a number of 
      studies have shown that the administration of prothrombin complex concentrate 
      resulted in a correction of the prolonged prothrombin time and restored depressed 
      thrombin generation after rivaroxaban treatment in a controlled trial in healthy 
      human subjects. In view of the relatively wide availability of prothrombin 
      complex concentrates, this would be an interesting option if the results can be 
      confirmed in patients on oral factor Xa inhibitors who present with bleeding 
      complications. More specific reversal can be achieved with andexanet, a new agent 
      currently in development that competitively binds to the anti-factor Xa agents. 
      For the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, the administration of prothrombin 
      complex concentrates showed variable results in various volunteer trials and 
      efficacy at relatively high doses in animal studies. Recently, a Fab fragment of 
      a monoclonal antibody (idarucizumab) was shown to be an effective reversal agent 
      for dabigatran in human studies. CONCLUSION: For the new generation of DOACs, 
      several reversal strategies and specific antidotes are under evaluation, although 
      most interventions need further evaluation in clinical trials.

TI  - Value of quantifying ABC transporters by mass spectrometry and impact on in 
      vitro-to-in vivo prediction of transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions of 
      rivaroxaban.

AB  - ABC transporters, such as P-gp and BCRP, are involved in rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics and can lead to drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Investigations of 
      the victim role for rivaroxaban and transporter-mediated DDI are commonly 
      performed using in vitro models. However, interpretation of rivaroxaban efflux 
      transport and DDI studies in cell models may be influenced by P-gp and BCRP 
      transporter abundance. This study aimed to develop an LC-MS/MS quantification 
      method for assessing the relationship between transporter expression and 
      functionality in Caco-2(ATCC), Caco-2(ECACC), MDCK-MDR1, MDCK-BCRP cell models. 
      First, the relative and absolute quantities of the transporters were determined 
      by LC-MS/MS. P-gp and BCRP expression was then confirmed by western blotting and 
      immunofluorescence staining. Finally, P-gp and BCRP functional activities and 
      half-inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of two specific inhibitors (verapamil and 
      ko143) were determined by bidirectional transport experiments. P-gp and BCRP 
      protein expression was detected at the cell membrane and was greater in the 
      respective transfected models. Efflux ratios were correlated with P-gp and BCRP 
      quantities. The lowest IC50s were obtained in the MDCK-MDR1 and MDCK-BCRP models 
      for verapamil and ko143, respectively. In conclusion, this study demonstrated 
      that LC-MS/MS can accurately quantify P-gp and BCRP efflux transporters and 
      thereby improve the interpretation of transport data and in vitro-in vivo 
      correlations.

TI  - Absence of clinically relevant interactions between rivaroxaban--an oral, direct 
      Factor Xa inhibitor--and digoxin or atorvastatin in healthy subjects.
PG  - 1688-707
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate potential interactions between rivaroxaban, an oral 
      direct Factor Xa inhibitor approved for the management of thromboembolic 
      disorders, and digoxin or atorvastatin. METHODS: Two randomized, phase 1 clinical 
      trials were undertaken in healthy men to assess pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic interactions between rivaroxaban and digoxin or atorvastatin, and 
      the safety of these drug combinations. RESULTS: Steady-state rivaroxaban did not 
      affect the pharmacokinetic profile of steady-state digoxin (n = 17). Digoxin did 
      not significantly influence the pharmacokinetic profile of single-dose 
      rivaroxaban and had minimal effects on rivaroxaban-induced inhibition of Factor 
      Xa activity and prolongation of clotting time. Similarly, steady-state 
      atorvastatin did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile or the pharmacodynamics 
      of rivaroxaban and vice versa (n = 19). All drugs (alone or in combination) were 
      well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: There were no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic or 
      pharmacodynamic interactions between rivaroxaban and digoxin, or between 
      rivaroxaban and atorvastatin, suggesting that rivaroxaban can be coadministered 
      with either drug. This study also confirmed that rivaroxaban does not interact 
      with substrates for permeability (P)-glycoprotein alone (digoxin) or 
      P-glycoprotein and cytochrome P(450) (CYP)3A4 (atorvastatin).

LID - 10.1177/1060028015591846 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review current literature for target-specific oral anticoagulants 
      (TSOACs) and provide critical analysis for dosing recommendations in special 
      population groups. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted in Medline 
      (1996 to April week 2 2015) and Embase (1980 to 2015 week 16) using key terms 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, kidney diseases, liver diseases, 
      elderly, obesity, and special populations. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: 
      Randomized controlled trials in English assessing efficacy and safety of TSOACs 
      in healthy adults and special populations were selected for analysis. DATA 
      SYNTHESIS: Phase 3 trials for TSOACs predominately excluded patients with severe 
      renal impairment or active liver disease. There were no exclusion criteria based 
      on age, body weight or body mass index. Additional conclusions were made in 
      special populations, including those with renal or liver impairment and obese and 
      elderly patients, based on secondary analyses, pharmacokinetic, and 
      pharmacodynamic studies. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes 
      associated special populations may alter clinical decision with regard to drug 
      selection and dosing. It is valuable to understand the rationale for labeled 
      dosing recommendations in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and venous 
      thromboembolism treatment and prevention, particularly in patients that fall into 
      special population groups. Furthermore, the use of TSOACs is likely to increase 
      as clinicians gain experience with these agents and additional TSOACs and 
      indications are approved.

TI  - Downregulation of ABCB1 gene in patients with total hip or knee arthroplasty 
      influences pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban: a population 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study.
PG  - 817-824
LID - 10.1007/s00228-019-02639-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Rivaroxaban is a substrate for ABCB1 transporter and is commonly used in 
      patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery for thromboprophylaxis. The 
      objective of this study was to develop a population 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model to investigate the influence of 
      ABCB1 gene expression and polymorphism on rivaroxaban exposure and 
      anticoagulation effects. METHODS: Five blood samples per patient were collected 
      during 5 days after the surgery for the determination of rivaroxaban 
      concentration in plasma and for determination of prothrombin time and partial 
      thromboplastin time. Non-linear mixed effects model was used for a population 
      PK-PD analysis and for testing covariate effects. RESULTS: A one-compartment PK 
      model with first-order absorption adequately described the pharmacokinetic data. 
      The typical oral clearance (CL/F) was 6.12 L/h (relative standard error, 15.8%) 
      and was associated with ABCB1 expression. Compared to base line before the 
      surgery, a significant ABCB1 downregulation was observed 5 days after the surgery 
      (p < 0.001). Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were both linearly 
      associated to the logarithm of the rivaroxaban plasma concentration. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We confirmed that variable rivaroxaban CL/F is associated with ABCB1 expression, 
      which is in accordance with previous studies on P-glycoprotein involvement in 
      rivaroxaban PK. Furthermore, we observed the downregulation of ABCB1 expression 
      after the surgery. The cause remains unclear and further research is needed to 
      explain the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Oral anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy are risk factors for 
      gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. GI bleeding-especially lower GI bleeding-seems to 
      be associated with a poorer outcome. With the introduction of dabigatrane and 
      rivaroxaban, difficulties in the management of bleeding complications arose. 
      Thus, the goal of the authors was to establish a standard operating procedure 
      (SOP) for the treatment of severe GI bleeding associated with rivaroxaban, 
      dabigatrane, and antiplatelet therapy. Bleeding complications during 
      phenprocoumon treatment should be treated with prothrombin complex concentrates 
      and vitamin K1. Dabigatrane elimination is highly dependent to the renal 
      function. The measurement of drug concentrations of dabigatrane and rivaroxaban 
      is useful to indicate an increased risk of bleeding complications. Severe 
      bleeding associated with dabigatrane or rivaroxaban therapy should trigger 
      prothrombin complex therapy, whereby in cases with severe bleeding associated 
      with antiplatelet therapy platelet transfusion should be initiated. Low-dose 
      aspirin should be continued after 24 h.

TI  - Effect of polypharmacy on bleeding with rivaroxaban versus vitamin K antagonist 
      for treatment of venous thromboembolism.
PG  - 1376-1384
LID - 10.1111/jth.15692 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy, including use of inhibitors of CYP3A4 and 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is common in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
      and is associated with increased bleeding. METHODS: In 8246 patients included in 
      the EINSTEIN-VTE studies for acute VTE, we evaluated the effect of polypharmacy 
      on bleeding and on the relative differences between rivaroxaban and 
      enoxaparin/vitamin K antagonist (VKA). We assessed the incidence of clinically 
      relevant bleeding (major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding) by number of 
      comedications (none, 1-3, ≥4) at baseline, and by use of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp 
      inhibitors. Interaction between rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin/VKA and 
      comedication was assessed by Cox regression analysis with p(interaction) 
      estimates. RESULTS: With increasing number of comedications, the incidence of 
      clinically relevant bleeding rose from 5.7% to 13.3% in rivaroxaban recipients 
      and from 9.1% to 11.1% in enoxaparin/VKA recipients. Whereas rivaroxaban was 
      associated with a reduced bleeding risk compared with enoxaparin/VKA in patients 
      without comedication (hazard ratio [HR] 0.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      0.4-0.9), the risk was similar in patients with ≥4 comedications (HR 1.2, 95% CI 
      0.97-1.5, p(interaction) .002). Use of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp inhibitors was 
      associated with a doubled bleeding risk compared with no use, without a 
      difference between rivaroxaban and enoxaparin/VKA. CONCLUSION: We conclude that 
      fixed-dose rivaroxaban as compared with enoxaparin followed by dose-adjusted VKA 
      is not associated with an increased bleeding risk in patients with VTE 
      administered polypharmacy in general and CYP3A4 and/or P-gp inhibitors 
      specifically. This implies that the observed increased bleeding risks with 
      polypharmacy and use of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp inhibitors are likely explained by 
      comorbidities and frailty, and not by pharmacokinetic interactions.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is increasingly used to treat patients with acute venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE), a potentially life-threatening condition. Because 
      absorption of rivaroxaban decreases from nearly 100% to 66% under fasting 
      conditions, it is recommended that VTE patients take rivaroxaban with a meal. 
      However, this recommendation is based on preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies 
      in healthy volunteers. So far, no clinical evidence is available to support this 
      recommendation. We describe a case of a compliant young patient who developed 
      recurrent pulmonary embolism during rivaroxaban treatment. PK studies provided 
      evidence that malabsorption of rivaroxaban 20 mg due to irregular intake of meals 
      during shift work was the leading cause of recurrent pulmonary embolism. When the 
      patient was instructed to take rivaroxaban with a regular meal, peak plasma 
      concentrations increased from 115 to 318 ng mL(-1) (+ 176%). Consequently, the 
      importance of taking rivaroxaban with food may have a greater clinical relevance 
      than data from preclinical PK studies suggest.

AB  - Renal impairment increases risk of stroke and systemic embolic events and 
      bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      have varied dependence on renal elimination, magnifying the importance of 
      appropriate patient selection, dosing, and periodic kidney function monitoring. 
      In randomized controlled trials of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, DOACs were at 
      least as effective and associated with less bleeding compared with warfarin. Each 
      direct oral anticoagulant was associated with reduced risk of stroke and systemic 
      embolic events and major bleeding compared with warfarin in nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Renal function 
      decrease appears less impacted by DOACs, which are associated with a better 
      risk-benefit profile than warfarin in patients with decreasing renal function 
      over time. Limited data address the risk-benefit profile of DOACs in patients 
      with severe impairment or on dialysis.

AB  - Rivaroxaban, a direct Factor Xa inhibitor, is indicated for stroke prevention in 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Studies have revealed that the clearance of 
      rivaroxaban is largely attributed to CYP3A4, CYP2J2 metabolism, and 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pathways. Amiodarone and dronedarone are 
      antiarrhythmic agents employed in AF management. Amiodarone, dronedarone, and 
      their major metabolites, N-desethylamiodarone (NDEA) and N-desbutyldronedarone 
      (NDBD), demonstrate inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 and CYP2J2 with U.S. Food and 
      Drug Administration-recommended probe substrates. In addition, both amiodarone 
      and dronedarone are known P-gp inhibitors. Hence, the concomitant administration 
      of these antiarrhythmic agents has the potential to augment the systemic exposure 
      of rivaroxaban through simultaneous impairment of its clearance pathways. 
      Currently, however, clinical data on the extent of these postulated drug-drug 
      interactions are lacking. In this study, in vitro inhibition assays using 
      rivaroxaban as the probe substrate demonstrated that both dronedarone and NDBD 
      produced reversible inhibition as well as irreversible mechanism-based 
      inactivation of CYP3A4- and CYP2J2-mediated metabolism of rivaroxaban. However, 
      amiodarone and NDEA were observed to cause reversible inhibition as well as 
      mechanism-based inactivation of CYP3A4 but not CYP2J2. In addition, amiodarone, 
      NDEA, and dronedarone, but not NDBD, were determined to inhibit P-gp-mediated 
      rivaroxaban transport. The in vitro inhibition parameters were fitted into a 
      mechanistic static model, which predicted a 37% and 31% increase in rivaroxaban 
      exposure due to the inhibition of hepatic and gut metabolism by amiodarone and 
      dronedarone, respectively. A separate model quantifying the inhibition of 
      P-gp-mediated efflux by amiodarone or dronedarone projected a 9% increase in 
      rivaroxaban exposure.

TI  - Rivaroxaban or Apixaban for Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation　- Efficacy and 
      Safety of Off-Label Under-Dosing According to Plasma Concentration.
PG  - 991-999
LID - 10.1253/circj.CJ-18-1282 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Practice-based investigations on direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) 
      treatment for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) have shown that off-label 
      under-dosing is increasingly becoming an issue. Here, we investigate the 
      significance of drug monitoring to prevent undesirable under-dosing with DOAC. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: In 255 outpatients with NVAF undergoing treatment with 
      rivaroxaban or apixaban we estimated the cut-offs for bleeding events using drug 
      plasma concentration (PC) data 3 h after drug treatment, that is, at the peak 
      level. Furthermore, we evaluated the appropriateness of labeled and off-label 
      dosing implemented for 348 patients using the obtainable PC threshold. A total of 
      73 off-label under-dose users of rivaroxaban (37% of all users and 63% of lower 
      dose users) had acceptable peak PC (155-400 ng/mL). Additionally, 46 off-label 
      under-dose users of apixaban (31% of all users and 55% of lower dose users) 
      received appropriate doses according to peak PC threshold (90-386.4 ng/mL). These 
      off-label under-dose users reported no bleeding or thromboembolic events during 
      follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulation monitoring enables personalized and 
      appropriate off-label under-dosing in NVAF patients on rivaroxaban or apixaban 
      through the measurement of peak PC during DOAC use.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of laboratory methods to monitor exposure of rivaroxaban at 
      trough and peak in patients with atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 671-9
LID - 10.1007/s00228-016-2060-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The one-dose daily regime of rivaroxaban could cause a pronounced 
      variability in concentration and effect of which a deeper knowledge is warranted. 
      This study aimed to evaluate the typical exposure range and effect of the direct 
      factor Xa (FXa)-inhibitor rivaroxaban in a cohort of well-characterized patients 
      with atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: Seventy-one AF patients (72 ± 8 years, 
      55 % men) were treated with rivaroxaban 15 mg/20 mg (n = 10/61) OD. Trough 
      (n = 71) and peak (n = 30) plasma concentrations determined by liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were compared to the 
      coagulation assays anti-FXa for rivaroxaban, prothrombin time-international 
      normalized ratio (PT-INR) (venous samples and point-of-care assay (POC) CoaguChek 
      XS Pro), and aPTT. RESULTS: Median rivaroxaban plasma concentrations by LC-MS/MS 
      were 34 (range 5-84) and 233 ng/ml (range 120-375) at trough and peak, 
      respectively. A strong correlation between LC-MS/MS and the anti-FXa assay was 
      found (p < 0.001) for both trough (r (2) = 0.92) and peak (r (2) = 0.91) samples. 
      PT-INR results from the POC assay, but not from the conventional PT assay, 
      correlated significantly with LC-MS/MS in peak samples exclusively (r (2) = 0.41, 
      p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In "real-life" AF patients treated with rivaroxaban, we 
      observed a pronounced variability in plasma concentrations at trough and to a 
      lesser extent at peak measured by LC-MS/MS. The anti-FXa assay performed well 
      upon rivaroxaban levels in a normal exposure range, although LC-MS/MS remains the 
      only method that covers the whole concentration range with accuracy. 
      Interestingly, the POC assay for PT-INR could be useful to indicate high exposure 
      to rivaroxaban in emergency situations although further validation is required.

TI  - Safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of BAY 59-7939--an oral, direct 
      Factor Xa inhibitor--after multiple dosing in healthy male subjects.
PG  - 873-80
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is a clinical need for safe new oral anticoagulants. The 
      safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of BAY 59-7939--a 
      novel, oral, direct Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor--were investigated in this 
      single-center, placebo-controlled, single-blind, parallel-group, multiple-dose 
      escalation study. METHODS: Healthy male subjects (aged 20-45 years, body mass 
      index 18.6-31.4 kg/m(2)) received oral BAY 59-7939 (n=8 per dose regimen) or 
      placebo (n=4 per dose regimen) on days 0 and 3-7. Dosing regimens were 5 mg once, 
      twice (bid), or three times daily, and 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg bid. RESULTS: There 
      were no clinically relevant changes in bleeding time or other safety variables 
      across all doses and regimens. There was no dose-related increase in the 
      frequency or severity of adverse events with BAY 59-7939. Maximum inhibition of 
      FXa activity occurred after approximately 3 h, and inhibition was maintained for 
      at least 12 h for all doses. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin 
      time, and HepTest were prolonged to a similar extent to inhibition of FXa 
      activity for all doses. Dose-proportional pharmacokinetics (AUC(tau, norm) and 
      C(max, norm)) were observed at steady state (day 7). Maximum plasma 
      concentrations were achieved after 3-4 h. The terminal half-life of BAY 59-7939 
      was 5.7-9.2 h at steady state. There was no relevant accumulation at any dose. 
      CONCLUSIONS: BAY 59-7939 was safe and well tolerated across the wide dose range 
      studied, with predictable, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics and no relevant accumulation beyond steady state. These results 
      support further investigation of BAY 59-7939 in phase II clinical trials.

AB  - An imbalance in coagulation is associated with cardiovascular events. For 
      prevention and treatment, anticoagulants, currently mainly xabans and gatrans, 
      are used. The purpose of the present study was to provide a head-to-head 
      comparison since there are no studies directly evaluating these novel 
      anticoagulants. An additional aim was to find whether selected anthropological 
      and biochemical factors can affect their anticoagulant properties as they are 
      used in fixed doses. In this cross-sectional study, blood from 50 generally 
      healthy donors was collected, and coagulation responses to dabigatran, 
      argatroban, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, at a concentration of 1 μM, were analyzed. 
      Heparin was used as a positive control. Prothrombin time (PT) expressed as 
      international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time 
      (aPTT) were measured and compared. Rivaroxaban was the most active according to 
      PT/INR while argatroban according to aPTT. The ex vivo anticoagulant effect 
      measured by INR correlated inversely with body mass index (BMI) in all four 
      anticoagulants tested. Shortening of aPTT was associated with higher cholesterol 
      and triglyceride levels. No sex-related differences were observed in response to 
      the anticoagulant treatments. As this was an ex vivo study and pharmacokinetic 
      factors were not included, the influence of BMI is of high therapeutic 
      importance.

TI  - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and direct oral anticoagulants: In vitro evaluation of 
      drug-drug interaction mediated by P-glycoprotein.
PG  - 860-868
LID - 10.1111/fcp.12769 [doi]
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now an option in the prevention and 
      treatment of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in patients with active cancer. 
      Pharmacokinetics of DOACs are largely influenced by efflux transporters derived 
      from ABC transporters, notably by P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The aim of this study 
      was to assess the potential P-gp-mediated drug-drug interactions between 11 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with apixaban and rivaroxaban. Bidirectional 
      permeabilities of apixaban and rivaroxaban were investigated across MDCK-MDR1 
      models, to determine half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50) ). Several 
      categories of interaction risks based on IC(50) values can be distinguished 
      depending on the TKI and DOAC used. IC(50) values of less than 10 μM were 
      observed with the combination of erlotinib, nilotinib with both DOACs, and with 
      dabrafenib and apixaban. IC(50) values between 10 and 100 μM were seen for 
      axitinib, crizotinib, dasatinib, imatinib, and lapatinib with apixaban, and for 
      axitinib, crizotinib, dabrafenib, idelalisib, imatinib, and vemurafenib with 
      rivaroxaban. A risk of drug-drug interaction was found in vitro between TKIs and 
      DOACs. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies are needed to ensure the safety of 
      prescribing DOACs in cancer patients on TKI therapy, in order to avoid major, 
      potentially preventable bleeding events.

AB  - The in vitro metabolism of rivaroxaban, a novel, oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor 
      for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders, was investigated in 
      several species, including humans. The objective of this study was to elucidate 
      metabolite structures and identify the metabolic pathways to provide support for 
      in vivo safety and clinical studies. [(14)C]Rivaroxaban was incubated with liver 
      microsomes and hepatocytes of rats, dogs, and humans. The samples were analyzed 
      by high-performance liquid chromatography-(14)C-tandem mass spectroscopy, to 
      generate metabolite profiles and propose or confirm the structures of the 
      metabolites formed. In vitro metabolite profiles showed no major differences 
      between species. The main oxidative metabolic pathways identified for all species 
      were hydroxylation at the morpholinone moiety (M-2, M-3, and M-8) and to a lesser 
      extent at the oxazolidinone moiety (M-9). M-2 was the main metabolite in all 
      microsomal incubations. M-1, a morpholinone ring-opened product formed by further 
      oxidation of M-2, was the main metabolite in all hepatocyte incubations. Other 
      pathways were amide hydrolysis at the morpholinone ring (M-7) and the 
      chlorothiophene amide moiety (M-13 and M-15). In hepatocytes, M-13 was readily 
      conjugated with glycine, leading to M-4. The metabolic fate of unlabeled M-15 was 
      investigated separately. Incubations with human liver microsomes and hepatocytes 
      showed that M-15 was first oxidized to the aldehyde intermediate M-16 and 
      subsequently reduced to M-17 (alcohol) or oxidized to M-18 (carboxylic acid). No 
      metabolism at the chlorothiophene moiety itself was found. Overall, rivaroxaban 
      showed no species differences in metabolism, with different independent metabolic 
      pathways and no formation of reactive metabolites.

TI  - Anti-Xa Activity Monitoring for Optimizing Rivaroxaban Dosage in Chinese Patients 
      with Cerebral Venous Thrombosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban, a direct Factor Xa inhibitor, is commonly used for 
      cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) correction. However, pharmacokinetic differences 
      in Chinese may vary in sensitivity and tolerance, resulting in either 
      insufficient or excessive anticoagulation. Herein, the optimizing dosages of 
      rivaroxaban in Chinese patients with CVT were analyzed based on monitoring 
      anti-Xa activity dynamically, to maintain therapeutic efficacy and reduce 
      rivaroxaban-related bleeding. METHODS: A real-world cohort study was conducted 
      involving 112 CVT patients in Xuanwu Hospital, from August 2021 through January 
      2024. Patients were grouped according to their doses of rivaroxaban use (5, 10, 
      15, and 20 mg daily) based on dynamic plasma anti-Xa activity monitored using the 
      chromogenic anti-Xa assay. Plasma levels of anti-Xa activity reached the 
      therapeutic range, bleeding events and the dosage of rivaroxaban among these 
      groups were analyzed. RESULTS: The ratios of the patients whose plasma anti-Xa 
      levels reached the standard therapeutic level (0.3-0.7 IU/mL) between the cohorts 
      less than 20 mg/d and 20 mg/d showed no statistical difference, and no 
      significant disparities were observed among 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/d dose groups. 
      There was a discernible increase in the proportion of patients with bleeding 
      events in the 20 mg/d group, even though the results did not reach a statistical 
      difference. Meanwhile, in patients with bleeding events, their plasma anti-Xa 
      levels could exceed 0.7 IU/mL. CONCLUSION: Sensitivity and tolerance to 
      rivaroxaban in Chinese may vary. Individualized therapy dosage under the guidance 
      of anti-Xa activity monitoring may not only guarantee anticoagulation effect, but 
      also reduce rivaroxaban-related bleeding events.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the rate and extent of 
      rivaroxaban transfer across the term human placenta and determine whether passive 
      diffusion was the primary mechanism involved in this transfer. STUDY DESIGN: The 
      transplacental pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban was determined with the ex-vivo 
      placenta perfusion model. Rivaroxaban was added to the maternal or fetal 
      circulation only (250 ng/mL). Additional experiments were conducted under 
      equilibrative conditions with the addition of rivaroxaban to both the maternal 
      and fetal circulations (250 ng/mL). Rivaroxaban concentrations were measured with 
      the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: There was 
      rapid transfer of rivaroxaban across the human placenta in both the 
      maternal-to-fetal and fetal-to-maternal directions, as evidenced by transfer 
      ratios of 0.69 (interquartile range, 0.58-0.73; n = 5) and 0.69 (interquartile 
      range, 0.67-0.71; n = 2), respectively, after 3 hours. Under equilibrative 
      conditions (n = 2), rivaroxaban concentrations remained relatively constant, 
      which suggests that rivaroxaban crosses the placenta down a concentration 
      gradient. CONCLUSION: This is the first direct evidence of rivaroxaban transfer 
      across the term human placenta from both the mother-to-fetus and fetus-to-mother 
      directions. Our results document that unbound rivaroxaban rapidly crosses the 
      placental barrier via passive diffusion. However, because rivaroxaban is highly 
      bound to plasma proteins (up to 95%), this suggests that the amount of unbound 
      drug that may reach the fetus is likely much lower. Additional studies will need 
      to explore its safety before administering rivaroxaban to a pregnant woman.

TI  - Rivaroxaban in atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 525-31
LID - 10.2147/VHRM.S19825 [doi]
AB  - Warfarin is the traditional therapeutic option available to manage thromboembolic 
      risk in atrial fibrillation. The hemorrhagic risk with warfarin depends mainly on 
      the international normalized ratio (INR). Data from randomized controlled trials 
      show that patients have a therapeutic INR (2.00-3.00) only 61%-68% of the time 
      while taking warfarin, and this target is sometimes hard to establish. Many 
      compounds have been developed in order to optimize the profile of oral 
      anticoagulants. We focus on one of them, rivaroxaban, comparing it with novel 
      alternatives, ie, dabigatran and apixaban. The indication for rivaroxaban in 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation was evaluated in ROCKET-AF (Rivaroxaban-once 
      daily, Oral, direct factor Xa inhibition Compared with vitamin K antagonism for 
      prevention of stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation). In this trial, 
      rivaroxaban was associated with a 12% reduction in the incidence of the primary 
      endpoint compared with warfarin (hazard ratio 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      0.74-1.03; P < 0.001 for noninferiority and P = 0.12 for superiority). However, 
      patients remained in the therapeutic range for INR only 55% of the time, which is 
      less than that in RE-LY (the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation 
      Therapy, 64%) and in the ARISTOTLE trial (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and 
      Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation, 66%). This shorter time spent 
      in the therapeutic range has been one of the main criticisms of the ROCKET-AF 
      trial, but could actually reflect what happens in real life. In addition, 
      rivaroxaban exhibits good pharmacokinetic and pharmacoeconomic properties. Novel 
      anticoagulants are a viable and commercially available alternative to vitamin K 
      antagonists nowadays for the prevention of thromboembolic complications in atrial 
      fibrillation. Rivaroxaban is an attractive alternative, but the true picture of 
      this novel compound in atrial fibrillation will only become available with more 
      widespread use.

TI  - Rivaroxaban, a direct Factor Xa inhibitor, versus acetylsalicylic acid as 
      thromboprophylaxis in children post-Fontan procedure: Rationale and design of a 
      prospective, randomized trial (the UNIVERSE study).
PG  - 97-104

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Fontan procedure is the final step of the 3-stage palliative 
      procedure commonly performed in children with single ventricle physiology. 
      Thrombosis remains an important complication in children after this procedure. To 
      date, guideline recommendations for the type and duration of thromboprophylaxis 
      after Fontan surgery are mainly based on extrapolation of knowledge gained from 
      adults at risk for thrombosis in other clinical settings. Warfarin is being used 
      off-label, and because of its multiple interactions with other drugs and food, a 
      new alternative is highly desirable. Rivaroxaban, a direct Factor Xa inhibitor 
      with a predictable pharmacokinetic profile, is a candidate to address this 
      medical need. STUDY DESIGN: The UNIVERSE study is a prospective, open-label, 
      active-controlled, multicenter study in children 2 to 8 years of age who have 
      single ventricle physiology and had the Fontan procedure within the 4 months 
      preceding enrollment. This study consists of 2 parts. In Part A, rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability are assessed to 
      validate the pediatric dosing selected. In Part B, safety and efficacy of 
      rivaroxaban versus acetylsalicylic acid are evaluated for thromboprophylaxis in 
      children post-Fontan procedure. Children in each part will receive study drug for 
      12 months. Part A has been completed with 12 children enrolled. Enrollment into 
      Part B is currently ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: The UNIVERSE study aims to provide 
      dosing, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy information on 
      the use of rivaroxaban, an oral anticoagulant, versus acetylsalicylic acid, an 
      antiplatelet agent, in children with single ventricle physiology after the Fontan 
      procedure.

TI  - The potential of target-specific oral anticoagulants for the acute and long-term 
      treatment of venous thromboembolism.
PG  - 2179-90
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2014.951425 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) comprises both deep vein thrombosis and 
      pulmonary embolism. VTE is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide 
      and its increasing incidence and prevalence are a major health concern. The 
      primary medical objective during the acute phase of VTE treatment is to prevent 
      thrombus extension and embolization. Extended treatment aims to prevent or 
      minimize long-term complications, such as recurrent VTE, post-thrombotic syndrome 
      and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. SCOPE: Anticoagulant therapy 
      has been the mainstay of treatment for VTE and traditionally involves initial 
      therapy with heparin, overlapping with and followed by a vitamin K antagonist. 
      Although effective, standard heparin/vitamin K antagonist therapy has several 
      limitations that can be overcome by more recently developed target-specific oral 
      anticoagulants (TSOACs). These agents have predictable pharmacokinetics, a rapid 
      onset of action and few drug-drug or drug-food interactions. Furthermore, TSOACs 
      offer convenient anticoagulation without the need for routine coagulation 
      monitoring and dose adjustment. FINDINGS: The efficacy and safety data from phase 
      III clinical trials support the use of TSOACs for VTE treatment, including in 
      special patient populations. Risk-stratification tools and strategies have been 
      developed to assist physicians in managing anticoagulation treatment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Rivaroxaban is the first TSOAC to gain widespread approval for the 
      treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and the long-term 
      prevention of recurrent VTE as monotherapy. Dabigatran has also been approved for 
      this indication recently. TSOACs, especially as monotherapy, represent a paradigm 
      shift in clinical practice for the management of patients with VTE.

TI  - New oral anticoagulants in practice: pharmacological and practical 
      considerations.
PG  - 175-89
LID - 10.1007/s40256-013-0061-0 [doi]
AB  - Although highly effective, warfarin use is complicated by its unpredictable 
      narrow therapeutic window, genetic heterogeneity in pharmacokinetic response, 
      numerous food and drug interactions, and the need for regular international 
      normalized ratio (INR) monitoring. Currently, several novel oral anticoagulant 
      (NOAC) drugs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) are available on the market as 
      alternatives to warfarin. These agents all feature more predictable 
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties than warfarin. Additionally, the 
      NOACs do not require routine monitoring of coagulation parameters, and have a 
      relatively lower potential for interactions with drug, herb, and dietary 
      constituents, which enhances the convenience of management for both patients and 
      health professionals alike. However, there are other considerations regarding the 
      use of NOACs that must be taken into account during management of therapy. In 
      contrast to warfarin, most NOACs need dosage adjustments in renal impairment and 
      are contraindicated in severe liver impairment, and there are no specific 
      antidotes for treating NOAC-related over-anticoagulation. The more frequent 
      dosing needed for NOACs may reduce adherence, especially in elderly patients with 
      polypharmacy. Furthermore, NOACs, especially dabigatran, are not as well 
      tolerated as warfarin in patients with gastrointestinal diseases. Overall, the 
      availability of the NOACs has expanded the treatment armamentarium, but they are 
      not without risk. Given the limited experience with the NOACs, their limited 
      range of indications, and their cost, the characteristics of each anticoagulant 
      must be carefully considered to carefully select the agent that will provide the 
      optimal risk/benefit profile in the individual patient.

TI  - Model-Based Assessment Using Conventional Bioequivalence Limits to Ensure Safety 
      and Efficacy of Rivaroxaban in Patients Undergoing Hip or Knee Replacement.
PG  - 1591-1599
LID - 10.1002/jcph.930 [doi]
AB  - We evaluated whether the current bioequivalence limit is adequate to ensure 
      safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban in patients under total hip arthroplasty and 
      total knee arthroplasty based on its model informed benefit/risk profile. 
      Clinical data from a total of 7145 patients from 3 phase 2 and 4 phase 3 clinical 
      trials were included in the current model-based exposure-response analysis. The 
      relationships between rivaroxaban exposure measurements (ie, minimum or trough, 
      maximum, average concentration, and area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] 
      at steady state) and clinical outcomes (ie, the probabilities of major bleeding 
      [MB] and venous thromboembolism [VTE]) were modeled using NONMEM 7.3. Model 
      evaluation was performed using predictive checks and nonparametric bootstrap. 
      Simulations were conducted to assess the study objectives. A shallow relationship 
      was observed between explored exposure measurements within the tested dose range 
      and the probability of VTE following rivaroxaban treatment. Trough concentrations 
      were found to be a statistically significant predictor of the probability of MB. 
      This relationship was better described using a power function. Model validation 
      confirmed model adequacy. Based on the simulations results, the relative risk of 
      MB of a hypothetical test product (with 20% change in AUC) will not statistically 
      differ from the brand name drug. Twenty percent AUC variations do not change the 
      relative risk of MB and is unlikely to compromise efficacy of therapy. A generic 
      drug of rivaroxaban passing the typical bioequivalence assessment is expected to 
      have similar safety and efficacy as the brand name drug.

TI  - Effects of the oral, direct factor xa inhibitor rivaroxaban on platelet-induced 
      thrombin generation and prothrombinase activity.
PG  - 1398-407
AB  - Rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) is an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor in advanced 
      development. This study was undertaken to investigate its effects on thrombin 
      generation. In this placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study, 12 healthy 
      subjects received rivaroxaban (single 5- or 30-mg dose) or placebo. Thrombin 
      generation was investigated by measuring the endogenous thrombin potential and 
      prothrombinase-induced clotting time. Maximal effect of rivaroxaban was observed 
      2 hours after drug administration: prothrombinase-induced clotting time was 
      prolonged 1.8 and 2.3 times baseline after rivaroxaban 5 and 30 mg, respectively. 
      Collagen-induced endogenous thrombin potential was reduced by approximately 80% 
      and approximately 90% compared with baseline after rivaroxaban 5 and 30 mg, 
      respectively, and tissue factor-induced endogenous thrombin potential was reduced 
      by approximately 40% (5 mg) and approximately 65% (30 mg), respectively. Thrombin 
      generation remained inhibited for 24 hours. There was a close correlation between 
      plasma concentration of rivaroxaban and prolongation of prothrombinase-induced 
      clotting time and reduction in endogenous thrombin potential. Rivaroxaban 
      strongly inhibits platelet-induced thrombin generation, after activation of 
      either platelets or the coagulation pathway, even in the presence of minimal 
      factor Xa inhibition in plasma.

TI  - Prevalence and bleeding risk associated with the concomitant use of direct oral 
      anticoagulants and antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with atrial fibrillation, 
      based on the French healthcare insurance database.
PG  - 937-945

AB  - PURPOSE: Pharmacokinetic interactions exist between apixaban or rivaroxaban, and 
      CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as amiodarone, verapamil and diltiazem. 
      We aimed to estimate the prevalence of exposure to this drug-drug association 
      (DDA) and to assess the bleeding risk associated in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation (AF). METHODS: We conducted a cohort study using a representative 
      1/97(th) sample of the French healthcare insurance database between 2014 and 
      2019. Patients with AF receiving apixaban or rivaroxaban were included and 
      followed-up until hospitalization for bleeding, death, discontinuation of 
      apixaban or rivaroxaban, exposure to strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, or until December 
      31(st) 2019, whichever came first. Primary outcome was hospitalization for 
      bleeding registered as primary diagnosis. The association between the exposure to 
      the DDA and hospitalization for bleeding was evaluated as a time-dependent 
      variable in Cox model. RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2019, the AF population under 
      apixaban or rivaroxaban represented 10,392 patients. During the study period, the 
      annual average prevalence of DDA exposure in this population was 38.9%. Among the 
      10,392 patients, 223 (2.1%) were hospitalized for bleeding, of which 75 (33.6%) 
      received the association and 148 (66.4%) received apixaban or rivaroxaban alone. 
      There was no association between DDA exposure and risk of hospitalization for 
      bleeding (aHR = 1.19, [95% CI: 0.90, 1.58]). Age (HR 1.03 [1.02, 1.05]) and male 
      gender (HR 1.72 [1.28, 2.30]) were associated with an increased risk of 
      hospitalization for bleeding. CONCLUSION: Exposure to antiarrhythmic drugs was 
      not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for bleeding in patients 
      with AF under rivaroxaban or apixaban.

TI  - Vesicular Carriers for Improved Oral Anticoagulation Competence of Rivaroxaban: 
      In Vitro and In Vivo Investigation.
PG  - 264
LID - 10.1208/s12249-024-02962-z [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant for avoidance and therapy of thromboembolic 
      disorders. Unfortunately, oral bioavailability of rivaroxaban is compromised with 
      dose increments. Accordingly, the aim was to test nano-vesicular lipid systems 
      for improved oral anticoagulation activity of rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban loaded 
      niosomes, bilosomes and spanlastic formulations were prepared. The prepared 
      systems were assessed in terms of particle size, zeta potential, transition 
      electron microscopic features (TEM), entrapment efficiency, in-vitro drug 
      release, and in-vivo anticoagulation performance in rats. The prepared vesicular 
      systems exposed spherical negatively charged vesicles with mean particle size 
      values between 136.6 nm to 387.9 nm depending on the composition. Rivaroxaban was 
      efficiently entrapped in the vesicular systems with entrapment efficiency values 
      ranging from 92.4% to 94.0%. Rivaroxaban underwent sustained release from the 
      fabricated vesicular systems. The in vivo performance of the tested preparation 
      revealed significant enhancement of the anticoagulation parameters. This was 
      manifested from the prolonged clotting time, and prothrombin time. Moreover, the 
      cut tails of the examined rats receiving the formulated nano-systems exposed a 
      lengthy tail bleeding time compared to those receiving the un-processed 
      rivaroxaban aqueous dispersion. In Conclusion, niosomes, bilosomes and spanlastic 
      nano-dispersions have a potential to overwhelm the oral anticoagulation 
      efficiency of rivaroxaban with spanlastic ranked as best.

TI  - Development of a Rapid Qualitative Screen for Anticoagulant Presence.
PG  - 305-315
LID - 10.1093/jalm/jfad081 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and fondaparinux with stable 
      pharmacokinetics are commonly used anticoagulants for outpatient care. Due to the 
      lack of monitoring requirements, drug-specific assays are not available in most 
      hospital laboratories, but drug levels are needed in some urgent/emergency 
      situations. This study describes the development of a qualitative screen for the 
      presence of DOAC or fondaparinux using coagulation tests found in most 
      laboratories. METHODS: The DOAC screen is composed of a heparin anti-Xa activity 
      assay and thrombin time (TT) assay. The STA®-Liquid-Anti-Xa assay calibrated with 
      Stago Multi Hep® and STA®-TT were run on STA-R Max® analyzers. The anti-Xa 
      activity and TT assays were repeated 5 times in samples of commercially available 
      calibrators and controls for each drug: fondaparinux, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban. Statistical analysis and correlations were performed for 
      anti-Xa activity and TT results for each drug and pooled normal plasma. RESULTS: 
      A significant correlation was found between heparin-calibrated anti-Xa levels and 
      fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, apixiban, and edoxaban (r2 = 0.99-1.0). Dabigatran 
      showed a strong linear correlation (r2 = 0.99) with TT. Anti-Xa levels >0.3 IU/mL 
      and TT >25 seconds were determined as cutoffs at our lab for the detection of 
      clinically relevant drug levels of factor Xa inhibitor and direct thrombin 
      inhibitor, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that commonly 
      available heparin anti-Xa activity and TT assays can be used to qualitatively 
      detect DOACs and fondaparinux and provides a method to establish a qualitative 
      interpretation.

      various stages of chronic kidney disease. Overall, anticoagulation is underused. 
      Warfarin use becomes increasingly difficult with advancing kidney disease, with 
      difficulty maintaining international normalised ratio (INR) in therapeutic range, 
      increased risk of intracranial and fatal bleeding compared to non-vitamin K oral 
      anticoagulants (NOACs), and high rates of discontinuation. Similarly, the direct 
      thrombin inhibitor dabigatran is not recommended as it is predominantly renally 
      excreted with consequent increased plasma levels and bleeding risk with advanced 
      kidney disease. The Factor Xa inhibitors apixaban and rivaroxaban have less renal 
      excretion (25-35%), modest increases in plasma levels with advancing kidney 
      disease, and are the preferred first line choice for anticoagulation in moderate 
      kidney disease based on strong evidence from randomised clinical trials (RCTs). 
      In severe kidney disease there is a paucity of RCT data, but extrapolation of the 
      pharmacokinetic and RCT data for moderate kidney disease, and observational 
      studies, support the considered use of dose-adjusted Factor Xa inhibitors unless 
      the bleeding risk is prohibitive. In Australia, apixaban is approved for 
      creatinine clearance down to 25 mL/min, and rivaroxaban down to 15 mL/min. For 
      end-stage kidney disease warfarin is the only agent approved, but we recommend 
      against anticoagulation (except in selected cases) due to high bleeding risk, 
      multiple co-morbidities, and questionable benefit.

TI  - LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous determination of rivaroxaban and metformin in 
      rat plasma: application to pharmacokinetic interaction study.
PG  - 2269-2281
LID - 10.4155/bio-2019-0230 [doi]
AB  - Aim: A reliable, sensitive and simple LC-MS/MS method has been established and 
      validated for the quantitation of rivaroxaban (RIV) and metformin (MET) in rat 
      plasma. Results: The procedure of method validation was conducted according to 
      the guiding principles of EMA and US FDA. At the same time, the method was 
      applied to pharmacokinetic interactions study between RIV and MET for the first 
      time. When RIV and MET coadministered to rats, pharmacokinetic parameters of MET 
      like AUC((0-t)), AUC((0-∞)) and C(max) had statistically significant increased. 
      t(max) of RIV was prolonged without affecting t(1/2) obviously and C(max) was 
      inhibited significantly (p < 0.05) by comparison to the single group. Conclusion: 
      The results indicated that drug-drug interactions occurred when the 
      coadministration of RIV and MET.

TI  - Bioequivalence Study of Capsules versus Film Tablets Containing Rivaroxaban in 
      Healthy Caucasian Subjects under Fasting and Fed Conditions.
PG  - 281-287
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.1342 [doi]
AB  - The bioequivalence (BE) of orally administered capsules versus film tablets 
      containing 20  and 10 mg of rivaroxaban was assessed in 2 single-dose, 
      open-label, randomized 2-way crossover trials with a washout period of at least 1 
      week. The study for the 10 mg strength was conducted under fasting conditions (n 
      = 68) and the study for the 20 mg strength under fed conditions (n = 52). Blood 
      samples were collected over a 36-hour period and concentrations were assayed 
      using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Pharmacokinetic 
      (PK) evaluation was performed with the program Phoenix WinNonlin, for 
      non-compartmental assessment of data. After administration of 10 mg rivaroxaban 
      under fasting conditions, mean Area Under the time - concentration Curve until 
      the last blood sampling point (AUC(t) ), Area Under the time - concentration 
      Curve until infinity (AUC(∞) ), and maximum plasma concentration (C(max) ) were 
      comparable (972 ng/mL*h, 1048 ng/mL*h, and 111 ng/mL, respectively, for the test 
      and 1013 ng/mL*h, 1070 ng/mL*h and 130 ng/mL, respectively, for the reference 
      formulation). Mean AUC(t) , AUC(∞) , and C(max) were also comparable under fed 
      conditions after administration of 20 mg rivaroxaban (2145 ng/mL*h, 2198 ng/mL*h 
      and 275 ng/mL, respectively, for the test and 1856 ng/mL*h, 1916 ng/mL*h and 
      240 ng/mL, respectively, for the reference formulation). The 90% confidence 
      intervals for all PK parameters were within the acceptance range of 80%-125%, 
      suggesting BE between the generic product and the innovator product in healthy 
      Caucasian male subjects. A clinically relevant difference in the tolerability and 
      safety of the treatments was not detected. Study results indicated that the 
      capsule formulations were bioequivalent with the film tablet formulations.

TI  - Phamacokinetics of rivaroxaban in adolescents.
PG  - 85-7
LID - 10.5482/HAMO-13-06-0033 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban is approved for venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) treatment in adults. However, in all phase-III trials 
      children or adolescents have not been included. For under-aged VTE patients, 
      current standard treatment consists of low molecular weight heparin or Vitamin K 
      antagonists. Rivaroxaban could be an attractive alternative, however, no data on 
      the pharmacokinetics (PK) of rivaroxaban in adolescents are currently available. 
      PATIENT, METHODS: We report PK data for rivaroxaban derived from a girl (age:15 
      years), who presented three month after acute deep vein thrombosis, already 
      receiving rivaroxaban therapy. In the steady state of rivaroxaban therapy (20 mg 
      once daily), plasma levels at baseline, 3 and 6 hours after intake of rivaroxaban 
      were measured to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and changes of global coagulation 
      tests. RESULTS: At baseline, a very low trough level of only 9.9 ng/ml 
      rivaroxaban was found. At 3 hours, a peak concentration of 137.76 ng/ml 
      rivaroxaban was observed with a rapid decrease within 6 hours after drug intake, 
      when plasma levels of 34.45 ng/ml were measured. The patients INR and aPTT values 
      reacted correspondingly. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that adolescents may 
      exhibit lower peak and trough levels after rivaroxaban intake compared to adult 
      patients, but seem to have similar PK curves during the elimination phase. While 
      our case is the first published case of a successful VTE treatment in an 
      under-aged patient, we strongly discourage the routine use of rivaroxaban in 
      non-adult patients, until data from phase II and III trials are available.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Pediatric 
      Venous Thromboembolism Treatment and Thromboprophylaxis: A Systematic Review of 
      the Literature.
PG  - 643-653
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1725944 [doi]
AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children can lead to significant morbidity and 
      mortality. Traditionally, treatment for thrombotic events in pediatric patients 
      has been limited mainly to unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin 
      (LMWH), or vitamin K antagonists. Since the first non-vitamin K antagonist oral 
      anticoagulant (NOAC) was approved for adult use, these agents have gained 
      popularity for a variety of indications. This is largely due to their ease of 
      administration, favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile, decreased 
      food interactions, and decreased need for therapeutic drug monitoring. Treating 
      and preventing VTE with traditional anticoagulants in pediatric patients presents 
      many challenges. This systematic review evaluated the current literature 
      regarding pediatric NOAC trials. Additionally, based on an up-to-date query of 
      clinicaltrials.gov, we detail current ongoing and as-yet unpublished clinical 
      trials, study outcomes, and projected completion dates. Published pediatric NOAC 
      trials have included 1,007 total children to date and have ranged from phase 1 to 
      4, with "indications" including both thromboembolism prophylaxis and VTE 
      treatment. Three recent phase 3 trials, specifically involving rivaroxaban and 
      dabigatran, have shown the agents to be at least as effective as traditional 
      anticoagulants for acute and/or extended VTE treatment, with low frequency of 
      recurrent thrombosis and clinically significant bleeding rates. Additionally, 
      specially developed and tested pediatric formulations have allowed for accurate 
      and reliable dosing, oral administration, stable pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics, and fewer drug or food interactions. Ongoing trials, 
      anticipated for completion in the next few years, will reveal important 
      information with regard to thromboembolism prophylaxis in special pediatric 
      subpopulations and settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to discuss the controversies 
      surrounding the use and dosing of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in 
      obese patients recognizing the limitations of the existing evidence base that 
      preclude strong recommendations. DATA SOURCES: A literature search of MEDLINE was 
      performed (2020 to end August 2022) subsequent to recent guidelines using the 
      following search terms: direct acting anticoagulants, obesity, rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran, dabigatran etexilate, and clinical practice 
      guidelines. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA ABSTRACTION: English-language studies and 
      those conducted in adults were selected. DATA SYNTHESIS: The available randomized 
      studies evaluating DOACs had relatively small numbers of patients with more 
      extreme forms of obesity (body mass index [BMI] > 40 kg/m(2)) and none of the 
      larger studies had a specific focus on dosing DOACs in obese patients. Recent 
      guidelines by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) have 
      specific recommendations for dosing DOACs in obesity. There are 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and observational studies published before and 
      after the ISTH guidelines with a focus on DOAC dosing in obese patients that 
      generally support the recommendations in the guidelines, but most involved small 
      numbers of patients usually with BMIs <45 kg/m(2). RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND 
      CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review discusses DOAC dosing in obesity with important 
      considerations for clinicians related to DOAC choice and dosing. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Dosing alterations of DOACs do not appear to be necessary when used for either 
      prophylaxis or treatment in patients with BMIs up to approximately 45 to 50 
      kg/m(2), but research is needed for BMIs >50 kg/m(2).

TI  - Modified ROTEM for the detection of rivaroxaban and apixaban anticoagulant 
      activity in whole blood: A diagnostic test study.
PG  - 449-456
LID - 10.1097/EJA.0000000000000903 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid detection of the anticoagulant effect of oral factor Xa (FXa) 
      inhibitors may be essential in several emergency clinical situations. Specific 
      assays quantifying the drugs are performed in plasma and require a turnaround 
      time that is too long to be useful in emergency situations. Rotational 
      thromboelastometry (ROTEM) is a whole blood coagulation assay of blood 
      viscoelasticity and could be of interest for FXa inhibitor detection in 
      emergency. However, conventional ROTEM reagents only detect high amounts of 
      inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was first to assess the effect of 
      whole blood components on the viscoelastic measurement of the effects of FXa 
      inhibitors, and second to evaluate whether a modified ROTEM, triggered with a low 
      amount of tissue factor and a saturating amount of phospholipid vesicles, can 
      reliably detect low levels of FXa inhibitor activity in whole blood. DESIGN: 
      Diagnostic test study. SETTINGS: A university research laboratory. From November 
      2014 to April 2016. PATIENTS: Sixty-six patients: 30 treated with rivaroxaban, 17 
      with apixaban and 19 without treatment. INTERVENTION: ROTEM was triggered with 
      2.5 pmol l of tissue factor and 10 μmol l of phospholipid vesicles. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Modified ROTEM parameters were measured in different experimental 
      conditions: platelet-poor plasma (PPP), platelet-rich plasma, PPP supplemented 
      with fibrinogen and reconstituted whole blood with various haematocrit levels 
      adjusted between 30 and 60%. Modified ROTEM was further validated using whole 
      blood from patients who were either treated or not treated with FXa inhibitors. 
      RESULTS: Modified ROTEM allowed detection of as little as 25 ng ml FXa inhibitors 
      in PPP, with at least a 1.4-fold increase of the clotting time (P ≤ 0.02). 
      Neither changes of fibrinogen concentration nor variations of platelet count or 
      haematocrit precluded FXa inhibitor detection. A lengthened modified ROTEM 
      clotting time of more than 197 s allowed detection of FXa inhibitor 
      concentrations above 30 ng ml in whole blood with 90% sensitivity and 85% 
      specificity. CONCLUSION: Modified ROTEM may be applicable in emergency situations 
      for the detection of FXa inhibitors in whole blood.

AB  - The use of direct oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation continues to rise. Certain populations may be at higher risk for 
      increased drug exposure and adverse events. Pharmacokinetic studies suggest 
      increased exposure of rivaroxaban and apixaban with combined P-gp and moderate 
      CYP3A4 inhibitors but the clinical relevance of this is unknown. This 
      retrospective cohort study included patients receiving rivaroxaban or apixaban 
      from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2016 with a moderate inhibitor (amiodarone, 
      dronedarone, diltiazem, verapamil) for at least 3 months in the drug-drug 
      interaction (DDI) group. Propensity matching was used to identify similar control 
      patients without the presence of the DDI. The primary outcome was a time to event 
      analysis of any bleeding episode as defined by the International Society of 
      Thrombosis and Hemostasis. After propensity matching, 213 patients with similar 
      baseline characteristics were included in each group. The mean CHA2DS2-VASc score 
      was 3.0 and median duration of follow-up was 1.45 years. The primary outcome 
      occurred in 26.4% of patients in the DDI group and 18.4% in the control group 
      (hazard ratio 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19 to 2.73; p-value = 0.006). 
      There was no difference in bleeding rates based on type of inhibitor. Use of a 
      combined P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor with rivaroxaban or apixaban 
      increased bleeding risk compared to patients without the DDI in this real world, 
      retrospective study. Analysis in a larger patient population is needed to confirm 
      these findings.

AB  - Thromboembolic diseases are common. Heparins and the vitamin K antagonists have 
      been the mainstay of therapy for &gt; 60 years, but both classes of agents have 
      limitations. The "ideal" anticoagulant should be as effective and safe as heparin 
      and vitamin K antagonists but should also be available in both a parenteral and 
      an oral formulation, have predictable pharmacokinetics, and lack significant 
      toxicities unrelated to the anticoagulant activity. Moreover, it should target a 
      specific coagulation factor and have an antidote that leads to rapid reversal. 
      There are now agents that fulfill some of these criteria. Here we review the 
      pharmacology and effectiveness of the oral activated factor X inhibitors 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban and the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. These 
      agents have undergone extensive phase 3 testing and are currently approved for 
      various indications in the United States, Canada, or Europe. Rivaroxaban is 
      approved in the United States for VTE prevention after major orthopedic surgery 
      and for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and is approved in Europe and 
      Canada for secondary prevention of VTE. Apixaban is currently under review by the 
      US Food and Drug Administration for stroke prevention and is approved in Europe 
      for VTE prevention following major orthopedic surgery. Dabigatran is approved in 
      the United States for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and is 
      being reviewed for secondary prevention of VTE.

AB  - Venous thromboembolism is a common cause of morbidity and mortality among 
      patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery. Due to the high incidence of 
      venous thromboembolism in this setting, perioperative anticoagulation is the 
      recommended approach for thromboprophylaxis. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), 
      fondaparinux and warfarin are the agents commonly used for thromboprophylaxis. 
      The well-recognized limitations of warfarin and the inconvenience and discomfort 
      associated with the subcutaneous administration of low molecular weight heparin 
      and fondaparinux inspired intense investigation to develop novel oral 
      anticoagulants (NOACs) with more predictable pharmacokinetics, fewer drug 
      interactions and no need for regular laboratory monitoring. Three NOACs have been 
      demonstrated to be effective for thromboprophylaxis after total hip arthroplasty 
      (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in large randomized controlled trials. 
      Here we review the pharmacology of rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and apixaban, 
      summarize the major clinical trials of these agents in thromboprophylaxis after 
      THA and TKA, and discuss the clinical factors to be considered by providers when 
      selecting a NOAC for their patients.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of a microdosed cocktail of three direct oral anticoagulants in 
      children with congenital heart defects: study protocol for a single-centre 
      clinical trial (DOAC-Child).
LID - 10.1136/bmjpo-2022-001662 [doi]
LID - e001662
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are direct inhibitors of 
      coagulation factor Xa and are frequently used in adults for different indications 
      such as deep vein thrombosis or non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Paediatric 
      patients might benefit as well from DOACs because the simplicity and convenience 
      of their use is likely to decrease physical and psychological stress related to 
      invasive procedures associated with phenprocoumon and heparin therapy. Thus, it 
      is expected that the future use of DOACs will ultimately improve compliance and 
      overall safety of anticoagulant therapies in paediatric populations. To assure 
      safe and effective use the clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      these drugs need to be evaluated in children. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is 
      a single-centre, open-label, clinical trial in a paediatric population with 
      non-cyanotic congenital heart defects. After having obtained informed consent 
      from the parents, each participant will receive a single oral administration of a 
      drinkable solution of a microdose cocktail of three FXa inhibitors consisting of 
      apixaban (12.5 µg), rivaroxaban (12.5 µg), edoxaban (50 µg), plus a microdose of 
      the two probe drugs midazolam (10 µg) and yohimbine (25 µg). Serial blood samples 
      (n=up to 20) will be collected at specified time points before and up to 25 hours 
      after cocktail administration. The primary PK endpoint will be the area under the 
      plasma concentration time curve of apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban. Secondary 
      PK outcomes will be C(max), t(max), t(1/2), Cl/F and V(ss)/F. Safety and 
      tolerability of the microdose cocktail will be evaluated as well by a collection 
      of adverse events. ETHICS: This study has been approved by the responsible Ethics 
      Committee of the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University. DISSEMINATION: Study 
      results will be presented at international scientific meetings and published in 
      peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: EudraCT 2019-001759-38 16, 
      DRKS00021455.

LID - 10.1177/1060028016632785 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review clinical data on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) used in 
      the acute treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) as well as practical 
      considerations when using these products. DATA SOURCES: Searches of PubMed and 
      Google Scholar for VTE, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and relevant 
      drug international nonproprietary names were conducted. Additional online 
      searches were conducted for prescribing information. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA 
      EXTRACTION: Relevant articles on dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban 
      for the management of VTE compared with oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; 
      published between 1966 and December 2015) were reviewed and summarized, together 
      with information on dosing, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and drug-drug 
      interactions. DATA SYNTHESIS: The DOACs have the potential to circumvent many of 
      the disadvantages of VKAs. At a minimum, they greatly increase the available 
      therapeutic options, thus providing a greater opportunity for clinicians to 
      select a management option that best fits the needs of individual patients. 
      Despite the significant advance that DOACs represent, they are not without risk 
      and require careful consideration of a number of clinical issues to optimize 
      safety and efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of DOACs for the management of 
      thromboembolic disorders represents a paradigm shift from oral VKAs. The DOACs 
      provide similar efficacy and improved safety in selected patients as compared 
      with VKAs. Clinicians treating VTE need to be familiar with the intricacies 
      involved in using these agents, including the appropriate dose selection for the 
      relevant indication, avoidance of drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, and 
      consideration of dose adjustments in specific clinical situations, such as organ 
      dysfunction.

LID - 38
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban, a novel oral anticoagulant drug, is widely used in 
      clinical practice. There is no standardized laboratory monitoring for 
      rivaroxaban, and its plasma concentration in Chinese patients with deep vein 
      thrombosis is unclear. The rivaroxaban concentrations in human plasma and 
      determine the steady-state concentration of rivaroxaban in patients with deep 
      vein thrombosis are needed. METHODS: An ultra-high-performance liquid 
      chromatography with mass spectrometric detection method was developed. 
      Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters BEH C18 column with 
      isocratic elution using a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and water. 
      Quantitation of the analytes was performed using positive ionization mode and 
      mass transitions of m/z 437.3 → m/z 145.0 and m/z 440.1 → m/z 145.0 for 
      rivaroxaban and the internal standard, respectively. Blood samples were collected 
      at 0 h and 2 h after patients took rivaroxaban for 7 days or more. RESULTS: The 
      method was validated over the concentration range of 0.5 ~ 400 ng•mL(- 1) with a 
      very low limit of quantification of 0.5 ng·mL(- 1), and the intra- and inter-day 
      precision (RSD%) were < 15%. The range of the steady state concentration in 
      patients that took 15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily, 10 mg twice daily, 20 mg once 
      daily, 15 mg once daily, and 10 mg once daily were 168.5 ~ 280.1 ng•mL(- 1), 
      74.2 ~ 271.4 ng•mL(- 1), 25.7 ~ 306.8 ng•mL(- 1), 24.5 ~ 306.4 ng•mL(- 1), and 
      15.4 ~ 229.2 ng•mL(- 1), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The plasma rivaroxaban 
      concentration in patients who took 10 mg rivaroxaban twice daily fluctuated less 
      than that in patients who took 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily. The plasma 
      concentration can be used for therapeutic drug monitoring for rivaroxaban.

TI  - The value of inhibitors of factor Xa for the treatment of pulmonary embolism.
PG  - 617-22
LID - 10.1007/s11739-014-1085-4 [doi]
AB  - The introduction of factor Xa inhibitors advocated the initiation of clinical 
      trials that addressed the value of anticoagulation in patients with 
      hemodynamically stable primary pulmonary embolism (PE). In the Matisse trial in 
      patients with PE, fondaparinux administered at therapeutic doses followed by 
      vitamin K antagonists (VKA) has shown a comparable efficacy and safety profile to 
      that seen with intravenous adjusted-dose unfractionated heparin/VKA. A 
      long-acting derivative of fondaparinux, idraparinux, failed to achieve similar 
      results. On the other hand, the Cassiopea study revealed that once weekly 
      injections of idrabiotaparinux, a slightly modified form of idraparinux, have 
      similar efficacy and better safety profile compared to VKAs in the long-term 
      treatment of patients with PE. However, the inconvenient parenteral 
      administration of both fondaparinux and idrabiotaparinux limits their routine 
      clinical use. The availability of antithrombotic compounds that can be 
      administered orally in fixed dose, owing to their predictable pharmacokinetics 
      and pharmacodynamics, and have a lower potential for drug and food interactions 
      has opened new horizons for the treatment of patients with PE. The Einstein PE, 
      Amplify and Hokusai studies, conducted with rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban, 
      respectively, showed that for the treatment of PE they possess a more favorable 
      benefit-to-risk profile than the conventional antithrombotic drugs. In addition, 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban make it possible to treat uncomplicated PE patients from 
      the beginning, without the need for the parenteral administration of heparins or 
      fondaparinux, and edoxaban allows the treatment of fragile patients with lower 
      doses. All of them cover a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, including PE 
      patients at intermediate risk.

AB  - We aimed to review the interfering effect of DOACs on tests for haemostatic 
      function and then to discuss overcoming these with activated carbon (AC) 
      products, thereby eliminating DOAC issues from test plasmas. Recent relevant 
      articles were reviewed and are discussed. Laboratory tests for DOACs, lupus 
      anticoagulant, factor assays and APC Resistance were carried out in such 
      publications with and without an AC product on various instruments using reagents 
      approved for diagnostic use in well-regulated clinical laboratories. All reports 
      on this plasma pre-treatment by AC products agree that they extract DOACs from 
      plasma samples with minimal effect on underlying clotting tests. The specific 
      extraction of DOACs significantly reduced false positive lupus anticoagulant 
      detection and provided more reliable results in clotting factor assays, APC 
      resistance and other thrombophilia tests. Dabigatran and edoxaban seem to be 
      adsorbed more thoroughly by AC from plasmas than rivaroxaban and apixaban. In 
      summary, most of the AC products reviewed here appear to remove DOACs from test 
      plasmas without significantly affecting underlying clotting tests and permit 
      correct diagnosis of various haemostatic conditions despite the initial presence 
      of DOACs. The application of such agents as a sample pre-treatment to overcome 
      the effects of DOACs for routine coagulation testing is supported by the emerging 
      literature.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between glomerular 
      filtration rate (GFR) estimated by different renal function equations and 
      non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant concentration. Atrial fibrillation 
      patients who aged ≥ 20 years and used dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban for 
      thromboembolism prevention were enrolled to collect blood samples and measure 
      drug concentrations using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with 
      tandem mass spectrometry. The GFR was estimated using the Cockroft-Gault formula 
      (abbreviated as creatinine clearance, CrCL), Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology 
      Collaboration formula (CKD-EPI) featuring both creatinine and cystatin C, and the 
      Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation (MDRD). Multivariate 
      regression was used to investigate the associations of different renal function 
      estimates with drug concentrations. A total of 511 participants were enrolled, 
      including 146 dabigatran users, 164 rivaroxaban users and 201 apixaban users. 
      Compared to clinical trials, 35.4% of dabigatran, 4.9% of rivaroxaban, and 5.5% 
      of apixaban concentrations were higher than the expected range (p < 0.001). 
      CKD-EPI and MDRD estimates classified fewer patients as having GFR < 50 mL/min 
      than CrCL in all 3 groups. Both CrCL and CKD-EPI were associated with 
      higher-than-expected ranges of dabigatran or rivaroxaban concentrations. 
      Nevertheless, none of the renal function equations was associated with 
      higher-than-expected apixaban concentrations. For participants aged ≥ 75 years, 
      CKD-EPI may be associated with higher-than-expected trough concentration of 
      dabigatran. In conclusion, CrCL and CKD-EPI both can be used to identify patients 
      with high trough concentrations of dabigatran or rivaroxaban. Among elderly 
      patients who used dabigatran, CKD-EPI may be associated with increased drug 
      concentration.

TI  - Application of a Novel UPLC-MS/MS Method for Analysis of Rivaroxaban 
      Concentrations in Dried Blood Spot and Plasma Samples Collected from Patients 
      with Venous Thrombosis.

AB  - Despite a higher safety profile compared to vitamin K antagonists, rivaroxaban 
      therapy is still connected with multiple adverse effects, such as a high risk of 
      bleeding. Thus, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of rivaroxaban concentrations 
      is suggested. An alternative to plasma samples can be dried blood spots (DBS), 
      which minimize the cost of sample storage and transport. In this study, we 
      developed a UPLC-MS/MS method for the analysis of rivaroxaban in DBS and plasma 
      samples. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 
      column (2.1 × 100 mm; 3.5 µm, Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) 
      with a mobile phase consisting of water and acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% 
      formic acid. The analytes were detected using a positive ionization mode by 
      multiple reaction monitoring. We validated the method according to ICH 
      guidelines. The precision and accuracy were satisfactory. Extraction recovery was 
      approximately 57% and 66% for DBS and plasma samples, respectively. A high 
      correlation between rivaroxaban concentrations in plasma and DBS samples 
      collected from patients was confirmed with Deming regression. The suitability of 
      both sampling techniques for the rivaroxaban TDM was also verified by 
      Bland-Altman plots based on DBS-predicted and observed plasma concentrations. In 
      addition, we found a significant relationship between rivaroxaban concentrations 
      and coagulation parameters, including prothrombin time (PT) and international 
      normalized ratio (INR).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Specific assays of plasma rivaroxaban level are not always readily 
      available with short turnaround time, which hamper the management of urgent 
      clinical situations. In this study, we aimed to build a predictive formula of 
      plasma rivaroxaban levels from international normalized ratio (INR) value and 
      validated in real world clinical situations. METHODS: Ninety-four patients who 
      were taking rivaroxaban participated in the study. Patients were randomized into 
      testing cohort and validation cohorts. The prediction formula was built from the 
      testing cohort and then validated in validation cohort. The predictive 
      performance was further validated on real-world clinical requests. RESULTS: The 
      root mean square error (RMSE) of the predictive formula for the testing and 
      validation cohorts were 61.81 and 69.32 ng/mL, respectively. The sensitivity and 
      specificity for the formula to predict the threshold plasma rivaroxaban level of 
      75 ng/mL were 95% (95% CI: 85.4%-100%) and 87.5% (95% CI: 71.3%-100%), 
      respectively, in real-world clinical situations. CONCLUSION: Plasma rivaroxaban 
      level of threshold level of 75 ng/mL can be calculated from prediction formula by 
      INR value with satisfactory accuracy and it can be used to guide the decision for 
      reversal.

AB  - The combination of antiarrhythmic agents, amiodarone or dronedarone, with the 
      anticoagulant rivaroxaban is used clinically in the management of atrial 
      fibrillation for rhythm control and secondary stroke prevention respectively. 
      Renal drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between amiodarone or dronedarone and 
      rivaroxaban were previously ascribed to inhibition of rivaroxaban secretion by 
      P-glycoprotein at the apical membrane of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. 
      Benzbromarone, a known inhibitor of organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3), shares a 
      benzofuran scaffold with amiodarone and dronedarone. However, inhibitory activity 
      of amiodarone and dronedarone against OAT3 remains arcane. Here, we conducted 
      in vitro transporter inhibition assays in OAT3-transfected HEK293 cells which 
      revealed amiodarone, dronedarone and their respective major 
      pharmacologically-active metabolites N-desethylamiodarone and 
      N-desbutyldronedarone possess inhibitory activity against OAT3, with corrected 
      K(i) values of 0.042, 0.019, 0.028 and 0.0046 μM respectively. Protein binding 
      effects and probe substrate dependency were accounted for in our assays. Static 
      modelling predicted 1.29-, 1.01-, 1.29- and 1.16-fold increase in rivaroxaban 
      exposure, culminating in a predicted 1.29-, 1.01-, 1.28- and 1.15-fold increase 
      in major bleeding risk respectively, suggesting potential OAT3-mediated DDI 
      between amiodarone and rivaroxaban. Future work involving physiologically-based 
      pharmacokinetic modelling is crucial in holistically predicting the complex DDIs 
      between the benzofuran antiarrhythmic agents and rivaroxaban.

AB  - Approximately 900,000 people are affected by some sort of venous thromboembolic 
      (VTE) event every year in the United States. VTE diagnosis used to mean treatment 
      with medications that required routine lab monitoring for safety and efficacy. 
      Activated factor X (FXa) inhibition has emerged as a convenient pathway for 
      management of VTE and currently three FXa inhibitors are available for 
      anticoagulation management - rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Continued 
      development of medications utilizing this pathway may offer advantages via novel 
      pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties that may minimize the adverse 
      effects associated with traditional anticoagulant therapy. This review summarizes 
      the available information regarding pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and early 
      safety and efficacy data for three factor Xa inhibitors being developed - 
      darexaban, betrixaban and nokxaban. The studies reviewed in this article suggests 
      that three newer agents possess the potential for promise based on early phase I 
      and II trials.

TI  - Rivaroxaban in the contemporary treatment of acute coronary syndromes.
PG  - 849-57
LID - 10.1517/13543784.2011.580274 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rivaroxaban is the first orally bioavailable direct factor Xa 
      inhibitor and its role in acute coronary syndrome is not fully understood. A 
      significant residual risk of recurrent ischemia remains in patients with acute 
      coronary syndrome despite optimal medical therapy. Warfarin has demonstrated 
      modest benefit that is offset by the risk of bleeding and complexity in its 
      management. Rivaroxaban may be an attractive agent for the treatment of acute 
      coronary syndromes given its predictable pharmacodynamics and favorable safety 
      profile. AREAS COVERED: The current guideline-based antithrombotic and adjunctive 
      medical therapies in acute coronary syndrome are summarized in this review. 
      Rivaroxaban's drug profile, its current applications, ongoing trials and 
      experience in patients with acute coronary syndrome are also described. EXPERT 
      OPINION: Current experience of rivaroxaban in acute coronary syndrome 
      demonstrates its safety and a trend towards benefit when added to current optimal 
      medical therapy. The benefits were observed primarily in patients receiving 
      aspirin monotherapy and increased bleeding among those receiving dual 
      anti-platelet therapy. This suggests that there may be a narrow window between 
      the optimal clinically achievable antithrombotic effect and the point where 
      bleeding risk outweighs the benefits. Though promising, it remains to be seen if 
      this drug will achieve the right balance between efficacy and bleeding risk.

TI  - Investigating Intestinal Transporter Involvement in Rivaroxaban Disposition 
      through Examination of Changes in Absorption.
PG  - 795-801
LID - 10.1007/s11095-021-03039-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The involvement of the intestinally expressed xenobiotic transporters 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) have been 
      implicated in rivaroxaban disposition based on in vitro studies, similar to what 
      had previously been proposed for apixaban. We recently showed that these efflux 
      transporters were not clinically relevant for apixaban disposition and examine 
      here their relevance for this second Factor Xa inhibitor. METHODS: Using recently 
      published methodologies to discern metabolic- from transporter- mediated drug 
      interactions, a critical evaluation was undertaken of 9 rivaroxaban studies 
      reporting 12 DDIs, one study of food effects and one study of hepatic function. 
      RESULTS: Rationale examination of these clinical studies using basic 
      pharmacokinetic theory finds little support for the clinical significance of 
      intestinal efflux transporters in rivaroxaban disposition. Drug-drug interactions 
      are most likely adequately predicted based on the level of CYP 3A metabolism. 
      CONCLUSION: These analyses indicate that inhibition of efflux transporters 
      appears to have negligible, clinically insignificant effects on the rivaroxaban 
      absorption process, which is consistent with the concern that predictions based 
      on in vitro measures may not translate to a clinically relevant interaction in 
      vivo. We emphasize the need to evaluate gastric emptying, dissolution and other 
      processes related to absorption when using MAT changes to indicate efflux 
      transporter inhibition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of vitamin K antagonists for the prevention of stroke and 
      systemic embolism in dialysis patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is 
      controversial. However, no good alternatives presently are available. The 
      anti-factor Xa antagonist rivaroxaban is contraindicated for lack of 
      pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and clinical data. This study aims to 
      characterize the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in maintenance 
      hemodialysis patients. STUDY DESIGN: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study. 
      SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 18 maintenance hemodialysis patients without residual 
      kidney function at 2 centers. DRUG ADMINISTRATION, OUTCOMES, & MEASUREMENTS: (1) 
      A single dose of 10mg of rivaroxaban was administered at the end of each of 3 
      consecutive dialysis sessions and area under the curve (AUC) and the effect on 
      coagulation parameters were measured for 44 hours thereafter. (2) A single dose 
      of 10mg of rivaroxaban was given 6 to 8 hours before a dialysis session and the 
      effect of dialysis on rivaroxaban concentrations was evaluated. (3) To assess 
      potential accumulation, 10mg of rivaroxaban was given once daily and AUC was 
      measured during 24 hours on days 1 and 7. RESULTS: Mean AUC0-44 of rivaroxaban 
      plasma concentrations after a single dose of 10mg was 2,072μg/L/h, mean maximum 
      concentration was 172.6μg/L, and mean terminal elimination half-life was 8.6 
      hours. Dialysis had no appreciable effect on rivaroxaban plasma concentrations. 
      Mean trough concentration after multiple daily doses of 10mg was 20.2μg/L. 
      LIMITATIONS: Higher rivaroxaban doses and patients with substantial residual 
      kidney function were not studied. CONCLUSIONS: A 10-mg dose of rivaroxaban in 
      hemodialysis patients without residual kidney function results in drug exposure 
      similar as published for 20mg in healthy volunteers. Rivaroxaban is not 
      eliminated by dialysis. There is no accumulation after multiple daily dosing. The 
      efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in hemodialysis patients should be the subject 
      of a large randomized trial.

TI  - Use of rivaroxaban in a patient with history of nephrotic syndrome and 
      hypercoagulability.
PG  - 1655-8
LID - 10.1177/1060028014549349 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypercoagulability, resulting in thromboembolic events, can be a 
      life-threatening complication of nephrotic syndrome (NS). Conventional 
      anticoagulants, such as warfarin, have been the standard of care for more than 50 
      years; however, the availability of target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs) 
      have provided additional options for the treatment and prevention of 
      thromboembolic events. Documented use of the TSOACs in patients with NS and 
      hypercoagulability is currently limited. CASE SUMMARY: We present the case of an 
      18-year-old young woman with NS and renal vein thrombosis who was readmitted with 
      bilateral pulmonary emboli on therapeutic doses of warfarin, with a goal 
      international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0. The decision was made to transition 
      the patient from warfarin to rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor. 
      DISCUSSION: Rivaroxaban was the first of the emerging TSOACs to be FDA approved 
      for both prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism. With favorable 
      safety and efficacy data compared with warfarin in addition to a predictable 
      pharmacokinetic profile and the lack of requirement of routine monitoring, 
      rivaroxaban provides a useful alternative in this patient population. SUMMARY: 
      While on therapeutic anticoagulation, a patient previously diagnosed with NS and 
      renal vein thrombosis experienced pulmonary emboli on a conventional 
      anticoagulant and was switched to a target-specific oral anticoagulant with 
      documented completion of 6 months of therapy without recurrent thromboembolism.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetic Models for Direct Oral Anticoagulants: A Systematic 
      Review and Clinical Appraisal Using Exposure Simulation.
PG  - 353-363
LID - 10.1002/cpt.2649 [doi]
AB  - Available data have shown an association between direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) 
      plasma concentration and clinical, particularly bleeding, events. Factors that 
      may influence DOAC plasma concentration are therefore the focus of particular 
      attention. Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analyses can help in identifying 
      such factors while providing predictive models. The main aim of the present study 
      was to identify all the PopPK models to date for the four most frequently used 
      DOACs (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban). The secondary aim was to 
      use these models to simulate different DOAC plasma concentration-time profiles in 
      relevant clinical scenarios. The results of our model-based simulations confirm 
      the clinical relevance of the known major factors influencing DOAC exposure and 
      support the current approved dose adaptation, at least for atrial fibrillation. 
      They also highlight how the accumulation of covariates, not currently considered 
      for dose adaptation due to their seemingly minor influence on DOAC exposure, lead 
      to supratherapeutic blood concentrations and could thus enhance the risk of major 
      bleeding. The present results therefore question DOAC dose adaptation in the 
      presence of these covariates, such as drug-drug interaction or genotypes, 
      alongside the known existing covariates. As the overall effect of accumulation of 
      several covariates could be difficult to apprehend for the clinicians, PopPK 
      modeling could represent an interesting approach for informed precision dosing 
      and to improve personalized prescription of DOACs.

TI  - Development of an UHPLC-UV-Method for Quantification of Direct Oral 
      Anticoagulants: Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, Dabigatran, and its Prodrug Dabigatran 
      Etexilate in Human Serum.
PG  - 66-76
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000355 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants currently have no indication for 
      monitoring even though there are data that imply that individual dosing can 
      improve and add safety to the therapy. METHODS: An ultra-high performance liquid 
      chromatography method with ultra violet detection has been developed and 
      validated for apixaban, dabigatran, dabigatran etexilate, and rivaroxaban. 
      Protein precipitation with methanol (1:3 vol/vol) was used as sample preparation. 
      Analyses were performed on an Agilent 1290 ultra-high performance liquid 
      chromatography system with an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18-RP column using 
      eluents [A] H2O and [B] methanol with 0.1% formic acid added to each. A gradient 
      run was performed with a flow of 0.7 mL/min at 35°C. Apixaban was detected at 280 
      nm, dabigatran at 294 nm, dabigatran etexilate at 340 nm, and rivaroxaban at 249 
      nm. RESULTS: Retention times were 1.83 minutes for dabigatran, 4.10 minutes for 
      rivaroxaban, 4.30 minutes for apixaban, and 6.10 minutes for dabigatran etexilate 
      within a total run time of 7 minutes. Linearity was given over a range from 20 to 
      300 ng/mL with r >0.999. The limit of detection ranged from 4 to 5 ng/mL and the 
      limit of quantification from 15 to 19 ng/mL, respectively. Usability in daily 
      routine was demonstrated in 27 samples from patients receiving rivaroxaban and 11 
      samples from patients receiving apixaban. In the absence of validated therapeutic 
      ranges, we estimated "assumed therapeutically effective concentrations" from 
      dose-related ranges for the respective licensed dosages. CONCLUSIONS: The method 
      offers a fast, reliable, and low-cost way to quantify direct oral anticoagulants 
      in daily routine even in smaller laboratories without access to liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry.

TI  - In Models of Intracerebral Hemorrhage, Rivaroxaban is Superior to Warfarin to 
      Limit Blood Brain Barrier Disruption and Hematoma Expansion.
PG  - 96-103
LID - 10.2174/1567202613666161216150835 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) during oral anticoagulation therapy 
      with an oral vitamin K epoxidase reductase such as warfarin is a life-threatening 
      complication. However, whether direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are associated 
      with larger hematoma volume and higher mortality rates remains controversial. We 
      evaluated the hematoma volume and pathophysiology of ICH during anticoagulation 
      with warfarin or rivaroxaban, an orally active direct factor Xa inhibitor. 
      METHOD: Mice were orally pretreated with rivaroxaban (10 or 30 mg/kg), warfarin 
      (4 mg/kg), or vehicle. ICH was induced by intrastriatal collagenase-injection. 
      Hematoma volume and neurological deficits 24 h after ICH induction were 
      significantly decreased in the rivaroxaban-pretreated group in comparison with 
      the warfarin-pretreated group. Rivaroxaban did not increase the hematoma volume 
      relative to that observed for vehicle, and improved survival rate 7 days after 
      ICH induction compared with warfarin. RESULT: We evaluated blood-brain barrier 
      (BBB) permeability 6 h after ICH induction using Evans blue spectrophotometry. 
      Evans blue extravasation was significantly reduced in the rivaroxaban group 
      compared with the warfarin group. To investigate the mechanism underlying 
      hematoma expansion and BBB permeability, we focused on thrombin, a clot-derived 
      factor and one of the major contributors to ICH-induced brain injury. To 
      investigate the effects of anticoagulant agents on thrombin-induced injuries, 
      human brain endothelial cells were used in membrane permeability assays. 
      Rivaroxaban, but not warfarin, significantly mitigated the thrombin-induced 
      increase in membrane permeability. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that 
      rivaroxaban decreases BBB disruption after ICH, and limits early hematoma 
      expansion in these experimental models compared with warfarin. Our study suggests 
      that rivaroxaban has advantages over warfarin with respect to ICH, an important 
      complication during long-term anticoagulation therapy.

TI  - A guide to new anticoagulant medications for ENT surgeons.
PG  - 1167-73
LID - 10.1017/S0022215115002765 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to ascertain otolaryngologists' current knowledge of 
      new (e.g. apixaban, rivaroxaban) and old (e.g. warfarin) anticoagulant 
      medications, and to provide an educational overview of new anticoagulants for use 
      by surgeons. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was distributed across the Wessex 
      region, UK, to ascertain the levels of knowledge of and confidence in managing 
      patients taking various anticoagulants. In total, 50 questionnaires were 
      completed (41 by trainees and 9 by consultants). A literature review of new 
      anticoagulant medications was then conducted. RESULTS: In general, there was poor 
      clinical and pharmacokinetic knowledge of newly licensed anticoagulant 
      medications. Respondents were more confident in the use of older vs newer forms 
      of anticoagulants. This was true across all grades of doctors, but particularly 
      at the senior level. All respondents stated that they would like to see an 
      educational resource on anticoagulants. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of newly licensed 
      anticoagulation medications is poor. This study has produced an educational 
      resource for the management of anticoagulant agents. A thorough knowledge of 
      these drugs is essential for the acute management of bleeding patients and in 
      peri-operative surgical planning.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A number of new oral anticoagulant drugs that selectively and 
      directly inhibit factor Xa (FXa) appear as promising alternatives to the existing 
      anticoagulant agents. These compounds present a convenient route of 
      administration with predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that allow 
      fixed dosing regimens without requiring coagulation monitoring. Rivaroxaban is 
      the first of this new class of drugs that was approved for the prevention of 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) after elective total hip replacement or total knee 
      replacement surgery in the EU, Canada and several other countries. Clinical 
      trials with rivaroxaban in patients with acute VTE and in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation have been recently completed. Numerous other compounds are under 
      different developing stages (apixaban, edoxaban, otamixaban, LY517717, 
      PRT-054021, YM150). AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of the two 
      oral anti-FXa drugs at the most advanced stage of development (rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban) and briefly describes and comments on the results of the most important 
      studies. EXPERT OPINION: Undoubtedly, these new drugs will offer several 
      advantages over the previous compounds, but a number of issues still require some 
      attention during the phase of translation from clinical trials into daily 
      clinical practice.

TI  - Quality-by-Design-Based Development of Rivaroxaban-Loaded Liquisolid Compact 
      Tablets with Improved Biopharmaceutical Attributes.
PG  - 176
LID - 10.1208/s12249-023-02635-3 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban (RXN) finds use in the management of pulmonary embolism and deep vein 
      thrombosis. Its poor solubility (5-7 µg/mL) and P-gp-mediated efflux from 
      intestinal lining limits the oral application of RXN. This work assessed the 
      impact of liquisolid compact technique in augmenting the solubility and 
      bioavailability of RXN. PEG 400, Avicel PH 200, and Aerosil 200 were used as 
      non-volatile liquid, carrier, and coating material, respectively, to formulate 
      RXN liquid-solid compacts (RXN LSCs). A 3(2)-factor factorial design was used in 
      the optimisation to assess the impacts of factors (load factor and 
      carrier:coating ratio) on the responses (angle of repose and Q(30 min)). 
      Pre-compression parameters of RXN LSCs suggested adequate flow and 
      compressibility. Optimisation data suggested significant influence of factors on 
      both the responses. Optimised RXN LSC-based tablets showed a significantly higher 
      in vitro dissolution rate than RXN API and Xarelto® tablets due to improved 
      solubility, reduced crystallinity, greater surface area, and enhanced wetting of 
      RXN particles. XRD, DSC, and SEM data supported RXN's amorphization. The 
      cytotoxicity (MTT assay) and permeation studies indicated the nontoxicity of 
      prepared RXN LSC tablets and the role of PEG 400 in inhibiting P-gp. 
      Pharmacokinetic study of RXN LSC-based tablets in Albino Wistar rats exhibited 
      2.51- and 1.66-times higher AUC in comparison to RXN API and Xarelto® tablets 
      respectively, demonstrating that developed formulation had a greater oral 
      bioavailability. The RXN LSC tablets showed longer bleeding times and higher 
      rates of platelet aggregation than RXN API. Thus, RXN LSC tablets can be 
      considered a facile, scalable technology.

TI  - Reversing Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Acute Intracranial Hemorrhage.
PG  - e1-e8
LID - 10.4037/ccn2019160 [doi]
AB  - Intracerebral hemorrhage is a major source of morbidity and mortality, accounting 
      for 10% of all strokes. Oral anticoagulation therapy, while necessary to prevent 
      thromboembolic complications, increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and 
      can potentially worsen bleeding in cases of acute hemorrhage. Before the 
      introduction of direct oral anticoagulant agents in 2010, warfarin was the only 
      option for oral anticoagulation. These new agents have an improved safety profile 
      compared with warfarin but require different reversal strategies. Anticoagulation 
      reversal in the setting of acute intracerebral hemorrhage is an evolving field. 
      This article covers the most common direct oral anticoagulant medications, 
      various available anticoagulant reversal strategies, and the latest guidelines 
      for anticoagulation reversal in patients with acute intracranial hemorrhage.

TI  - Risk of intraocular hemorrhage with new oral anticoagulants.
PG  - 628-631
LID - 10.1038/eye.2016.265 [doi]
AB  - PurposeTo assess the risk of intraocular hemorrhage with warfarin and new oral 
      anticoagulants (NOACs).MethodsWe ascertained all reported cases of intraocular 
      hemorrhage (vitreous, choroidal, or retinal) with warfarin and NOACs (including 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) from the World Health Organizations's Vigibase 
      database from 1968-2015. We used a disproportionality analysis to compute 
      reported odds ratios (RORs) and corresponding 95% confidence by comparing the 
      number of events with the study outcomes and study drugs compared with all other 
      drugs reported to Vigibase. A harmful signal was deemed for a lower limit of the 
      95% confidence interval above 1.ResultsWe identified 80 cases of intraocular 
      hemorrhage (vitreous, choroidal, or retinal) with warfarin in the World Health 
      Organizations's Vigibase database from 1968-2015. A total of 156 cases of 
      intraocular hemorrhage with NOACs (82 with rivaroxaban, 65 with dabigatran, 9 
      with apixaban). Warfarin had the highest signal of association with choroidal 
      hemorrhage (ROR= 65.40 (33.86-126.30)). Rivaroxaban had the highest signal of 
      association with both retinal and vitreous hemorrhage (ROR=7.41 (5.73-9.59) and 
      ROR= 11.14 (7.37-16.86), respectively). Dabigatran was also significantly 
      associated with retinal and vitreous hemorrhage (ROR= 3.78 (2.82-5.08) and ROR= 
      5.83 (3.66-9.30), respectively). The number of reports of retinal and vitreous 
      hemorrhage were also significantly higher with apixaban, but the number of cases 
      may be too little to make a meaningful evaluation.ConclusionA signal for risk of 
      intraocular hemorrhage was detected for warfarin, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban. 
      Large epidemiologic studies are needed to further confirm these findings.

TI  - New anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 515-24
LID - 10.1055/s-0029-1234147 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation is already the most common clinically significant cardiac 
      arrhythmia and a common cause of stroke. Vitamin K antagonists are very effective 
      for the prevention of cardioembolic stroke but have numerous limitations that 
      limit their uptake in eligible patients with AF and reduce their effectiveness in 
      treated patients. Multiple new anticoagulants are under development as potential 
      replacements for vitamin K antagonists. Most are small synthetic molecules that 
      target factor IIa (e.g., dabigatran etexilate, AZD-0837) or factor Xa (e.g., 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, DU176b, idrabiotaparinux). These drugs have 
      predictable pharmacokinetics that allow fixed dosing without laboratory 
      monitoring, and are being compared with vitamin K antagonists or aspirin in phase 
      III clinical trials [corrected]. A new vitamin K antagonist (ATI-5923) with 
      improved pharmacological properties compared with warfarin is also being 
      evaluated in a phase III trial. None of the new agents have as yet been approved 
      for clinical use.

TI  - Fixed dose rivaroxaban can be used in extremes of bodyweight: A population 
      pharmacokinetic analysis.
PG  - 2296-2307
LID - 10.1111/jth.14948 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging safety and efficacy data for rivaroxaban suggest traditional 
      therapy and rivaroxaban are comparable in the morbidly obese. However, real-world 
      data that indicate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters are comparable at the extremes 
      of body size are lacking. The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis 
      Scientific and Standardisation Committee (ISTH SSC) suggests avoiding the use of 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients weighing >120 kg or with a body 
      mass index >40 kg/m(2) and gives no recommendation on the use of DOACs in those 
      <50 kg. OBJECTIVES: To generate a population PK model to understand the influence 
      of bodyweight on rivaroxaban exposure from clinical practice data. METHOD: 
      Rivaroxaban plasma concentrations and patient characteristics were collated 
      between 2013 and 2018 at King's College Hospital anticoagulation clinic. A 
      population PK model was developed using a nonlinear mixed effects approach and 
      then used to simulate rivaroxaban concentrations at the extremes of bodyweight. 
      RESULTS: A robust population PK model derived from 913 patients weighing between 
      39 kg and 172 kg was developed. The model included data from n = 86 >120 kg, 
      n = 74 BMI >40 kg/m(2) , and n = 30 <50 kg. A one-compartment model with 
      between-subject variability on clearance and a proportional error model best 
      described the data. Creatinine clearance calculated by Cockcroft-Gault, with lean 
      bodyweight as the weight descriptor in this equation, was the most significant 
      covariate influencing rivaroxaban exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our work demonstrates 
      rivaroxaban can be used at extremes of bodyweight provided renal function is 
      satisfactory. We recommend that the ISTH SSC revises the current guidance with 
      respect to rivaroxaban at extremes of body size.

AB  - Thromboembolic disease, both arterial and venous, is a major cause of morbidity 
      and mortality in developed countries. The new anticoagulants exert their action 
      by selective, direct and reversible inhibition of a single coagulation factor. 
      Although the results of several phase III trials have demonstrated the safety and 
      efficacy of these drugs, their mechanism of action, as well as the 
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of these drugs, need to be understood for 
      their correct use. The present review discusses the features of the new 
      anticoagulants whose clinical development is more advanced, both those designed 
      to block active factor X, such as rivaroxaban or apixaban, and those designed to 
      block thrombin (also active factor II): dabigatran.

TI  - Application of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of rivaroxaban to 
      prospective simulations of drug-drug-disease interactions with protein kinase 
      inhibitors in cancer-associated venous thromboembolism.
PG  - 2267-2283
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15158 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Rivaroxaban is a viable anticoagulant for the management of 
      cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (CA-VTE). A previously verified 
      physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of rivaroxaban established how 
      its multiple pathways of elimination via both CYP3A4/2J2-mediated hepatic 
      metabolism and organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3)/P-glycoprotein-mediated renal 
      secretion predisposes rivaroxaban to drug-drug-disease interactions (DDDIs) with 
      clinically relevant protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs). We proposed the application 
      of PBPK modelling to prospectively interrogate clinically significant DDIs 
      between rivaroxaban and PKIs (erlotinib and nilotinib) for dose adjustments in 
      CA-VTE. METHODS: The inhibitory potencies of the PKIs on CYP3A4/2J2-mediated 
      metabolism of rivaroxaban were characterized. Using prototypical OAT3 inhibitor 
      ketoconazole, in vitro OAT3 inhibition assays were optimized to ascertain the in 
      vivo relevance of derived transport inhibitory constants (K(i) ). Untested DDDIs 
      between rivaroxaban and erlotinib or nilotinib were simulated. RESULTS: 
      Mechanism-based inactivation (MBI) of CYP3A4-mediated rivaroxaban metabolism by 
      both PKIs and MBI of CYP2J2 by erlotinib were established. The importance of 
      substrate specificity and nonspecific binding to derive OAT3-inhibitory K(i) 
      values of ketoconazole and nilotinib for the accurate prediction of interactions 
      was illustrated. When simulated rivaroxaban exposure variations with concomitant 
      erlotinib and nilotinib therapy were evaluated using published dose-exposure 
      equivalence metrics and bleeding risk analyses, dose reductions from 20 to 15 and 
      10 mg in normal and mild renal dysfunction, respectively, were warranted. 
      CONCLUSION: We established a PBPK-DDDI model to prospectively evaluate clinically 
      relevant interactions between rivaroxaban and PKIs for the safe and efficacious 
      management of CA-VTE.

TI  - Periprocedural Management of Chronically Anticoagulated Patients: A Practical 
      Approach to Use of Novel Anticoagulants in Orthopedic Surgery.
PG  - E161-6
AB  - Chronic anticoagulation is common in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty 
      (TJA). The newer novel oral anticoagulants dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban 
      target individual factors in the clotting cascade (factors Xa, IIa). The stable 
      pharmacokinetics of these medications provide improved efficacy and safety with 
      equivalent or superior antithrombotic properties. There are no management 
      guidelines for these newer anticoagulants in TJA. Understanding the 
      pharmacokinetics, conventional laboratory tests, dosing, and reversal methods 
      that can be used for coagulation hemostasis is crucial for surgeons who are 
      deciding whether to operate now or later.

TI  - In vitro assessment of P-gp and BCRP transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions 
      of riociguat with direct oral anticoagulants.
PG  - 109-119
LID - 10.1111/fcp.12504 [doi]
AB  - As an alternative to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) are increasingly prescribed in combination with riociguat in the 
      treatment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). 
      Pharmacokinetics of riociguat and DOACs are influenced by efflux transporters, 
      such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). This 
      work aimed to assess P-gp and BCRP-mediated drug-drug interactions of riociguat 
      with DOACs using in vitro models. Bidirectional permeabilities of apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban were investigated across MDCK-MDR1 and MDCK-BCRP models, in the 
      absence and in the presence of increasing concentrations of riociguat 
      (0.5-100 μm). Calculated efflux ratios were subsequently used to determine 
      riociguat inhibition percentages and half maximal inhibitory concentration 
      (IC50). P-gp-mediated efflux of apixaban and rivaroxaban was inhibited by 8% and 
      21%, respectively, in the presence of 100 μm riociguat. BCRP-mediated transport 
      of apixaban and rivaroxaban was inhibited by 36% and 77%, respectively. IC50s of 
      riociguat on MDCK-MDR1 and MDCK-BCRP models were higher than 100 μm for apixaban 
      and higher than 100 μm and 46.5 μm for rivaroxaban, respectively. This work 
      showed an in vitro inhibition of BCRP-mediated DOACs transport by riociguat. In 
      vivo studies may be required to determine the clinical relevance of these 
      transporter-mediated interactions.

TI  - Practical aspects of new oral anticoagulant use in atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 124-35
LID - AOP_14_015 [pii]
AB  - Dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor and 2 factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban 
      and apixaban, are target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs) approved for 
      prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation (AF). Published data suggest that all 3 agents are at least as 
      efficacious as dose‑adjusted warfarin in stroke prevention. Because of their 
      greater specificity, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics, 
      TSOACs have some advantages over vitamin K antagonists, which facilitates their 
      use in clinical practice. The current review addresses the practical questions 
      relating to the use of TSOACs in AF patients based on the available data and 
      personal experience. We discuss topics such as patient selection, renal 
      impairment, drug interactions, switching between anticoagulants, laboratory 
      monitoring, and the risk of bleeding along with its management. We will focus on 
      the aspects of the optimization of treatment with TSOACs in stroke prevention. 
      The understanding of these practical issues by clinicians and patients is of key 
      importance for the safe and effective use of TSOACs in everyday practice.

TI  - Rethinking the use of direct oral anticoagulants for secondary thromboprophylaxis 
      in patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome.
PG  - 213-219
LID - 10.5582/ddt.2024.01050 [doi]
AB  - Patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are at high risk for 
      recurrent thrombosis, and indefinite anticoagulation is recommended. Patients 
      with APS merit indefinite anticoagulation, and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have 
      historically been the standard treatment. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      present an appealing alternative to VKAs. Due to their pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic characteristics, DOACs offer advantages over VKAs, namely the 
      lack of need for laboratory monitoring, the usage of a fixed dosage, and the 
      absence of significant interaction with dietary components and drugs. The 
      efficacy and safety of DOACs in patients with APS have been studied in four phase 
      II/III clinical trials (three with rivaroxaban and one with apixaban). These 
      studies showed DOACs' inferiority compared to VKAs in preventing recurrent 
      thrombosis. Recurrence was significantly greater in patients with arterial 
      thrombotic events and a triple positivity for antiphospholipid antibodies. No 
      differences were observed in the incidence of venous thromboembolism between both 
      groups. Major bleeding was similar in patients treated with DOACs or VKAs. 
      Several observational studies have reported similar results. This review aims to 
      analyse the existing evidence on the efficacy and safety of DOACs for secondary 
      prevention in patients with APS.

TI  - Residual rivaroxaban exposure after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy in 
      patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.
PG  - 611-618
LID - 10.1007/s00228-018-2421-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) frequently 
      undergo interventional procedures requiring temporary discontinuation of 
      anticoagulant therapy. Little is known about remaining peri-procedural exposure 
      to rivaroxaban in real-world patients. METHODS: Fifty-six patients with 
      rivaroxaban treatment and scheduled cardiac catheterization were included in this 
      prospective, observational, and single-center study. Rivaroxaban concentrations 
      were determined by LC-MS/MS and a chromogenic anti-Xa assay. Population 
      pharmacokinetic modeling was carried out on LC-MS/MS concentration data using 
      NONMEM software, and results were applied to Monte Carlo simulations to predict 
      appropriate rivaroxaban discontinuation intervals. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban 
      concentrations ranged from <LLOQ to 300.6 ng/ml at the time of admission to 
      hospital and from <LLOQ to 55.5 ng/ml at the beginning of the procedure. Times 
      since last rivaroxaban intake were (mean ± SD) 51.0 ± 31.7 h (admission) and 
      85.5 ± 36.8 h (start catheterization). LC-MS/MS and anti-Xa assay results were in 
      good agreement (r = 0.958); however, the anti-Xa assay may underestimate low 
      rivaroxaban concentrations and overestimate rivaroxaban exposure when performed 
      on plasma samples contaminated with heparins. Pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban 
      were adequately described, and simulations predicted that 95% of patients will 
      have rivaroxaban concentrations ≤ 28.4 ng/ml (15 mg dose group) and ≤ 31.9 ng/ml 
      (20 mg dose group) after 48 h of discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of 
      patients, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations dropped below 30 ng/ml after 48 h of 
      treatment discontinuation which is considered hemostatically safe before surgery 
      with high bleeding risk. For accurate determination of low rivaroxaban 
      concentrations, LC-MS/MS is the preferred choice.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Emergency Situations: Results 
      of the Prospective Observational RADOA-Registry.
PG  - 552-559
LID - 10.1055/a-1549-6556 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used worldwide. 
      Little is known so far about their pharmacokinetics in emergency situations. 
      METHODS: A prospective, observational registry was performed to determine the 
      clinical course in consecutive patients with major bleeding or urgent surgery 
      treated with DOACs. In samples collected as part of routine care DOAC drug 
      concentrations were measured using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem 
      mass spectrometry. Anticoagulant intensity at first presentation and drug 
      half-life (t (1/2)), tested in repeat samples, were evaluated. RESULTS: A total 
      of 140 patients were prospectively included. Pharmacokinetic data were available 
      in 94% (132/140) of patients. Note that 67% (89/132) experienced life-threatening 
      bleeding and 33% (43/132) needed an urgent surgery. For pharmacokinetic analysis 
      a total of 605 blood samples was available. Median concentration on admission was 
      205 ng/mL for rivaroxaban and 108 ng/mL for apixaban. All treatment groups showed 
      a high variation of drug concentrations at baseline. In rivaroxaban-treated 
      patients t (½) was 17.3 hours (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.4-19.7) without 
      significant difference in both groups (major bleeding: t (½) 16.7 hours, 95% CI: 
      14.7-19.3; urgent surgery: t (½) 19.7 hours, 95% CI: 15.2-27.9; p = 0.292). In 
      apixaban-treated patients t (½) was 25.0 hours (95% CI: 22.9-27.6) with a longer 
      t (½) after urgent surgery (t (1/2): 30.8 hours; 95% CI: 26.9-36.4) compared with 
      severe bleeding (t (1/2): 20.8 hours; 95% CI: 18.8-23.2; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      Emergency patients under DOAC treatment show a high variation of anticoagulant 
      concentrations at baseline. Compared with rivaroxaban, apixaban showed a lower 
      median concentration on admission and a longer t (½).

AB  - Outpatient use of anticoagulants to prevent venous thromboembolism after total 
      hip or knee arthroplasty may be hampered either by requirements for parenteral 
      administration or high variability and frequent monitoring of anticoagulant 
      activity. Trials of the new oral direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran indicate that they can be 
      administered in fixed doses without monitoring and that they generally have 
      efficacy at least equivalent to enoxaparin, although with potential minor 
      differences in the balance of efficacy vs risk for bleeding. This article reviews 
      the results and pharmacokinetic properties that may influence their use in 
      clinical practice.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in preventing venous thromboembolism in 
      postoperative patients with gynecological malignancies: protocol for a randomised 
      controlled open-label trial (G-alfalfa trial).
PG  - e092164

LID - e092164
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Compared with the guideline-recommended use of low-molecular weight 
      heparin (LMWH) for 28 days to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) after 
      cytoreductive surgery, oral rivaroxaban avoids the pain and inconvenience of 
      daily injections and reduces medical expenses. The proposed randomised controlled 
      trial (RCT) aims to compare the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban and enoxaparin 
      in preventing VTE in patients after surgery for gynaecological malignancies and 
      to provide a reference for clinical medication prevention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 
      This is a single-centre, randomised, controlled, open-label and assessor-blind 
      clinical trial. Patients undergoing surgery for gynaecological malignancies will 
      be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to an oral rivaroxaban study group and a 
      subcutaneous injection enoxaparin control group for anticoagulant prophylaxis. 
      The medication administration begins 12-24 hours after surgery and continues for 
      28 days, with a 30-day follow-up after surgery. Clinical events during the 
      treatment and the follow-up period will be observed. The primary endpoint will be 
      any VTE. Secondary endpoints will be any bleeding event, medication compliance 
      rate, rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics. The sample size required 
      for the G-alfalfa trial is derived based on power calculations of the VTE 
      incidence in the two intervention regimens in previous literature. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Fujian Maternal 
      and Child Health Hospital on 2 April 2024 (Approval No.:2023KY174-03). The 
      results of the trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal 
      and presented at relevant conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Chinese 
      Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) 2300078535.

TI  - Anticoagulant Activities of Indobufen, an Antiplatelet Drug.
LID - 10.3390/molecules23061452 [doi]
LID - 1452
AB  - Indobufen is a new generation of anti-platelet aggregation drug, but studies were 
      not sufficient on its anticoagulant effects. In the present study, the 
      anticoagulant activity of indobufen was determined by monitoring the activated 
      partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), and thrombin time (TT) 
      in rabbit plasma. We evaluated the anticoagulant mechanisms on the content of the 
      platelet factor 3,4 (PF3,4), and the coagulation factor 1, 2, 5, 8, 10 (FI, II, 
      V, VIII, X) in rabbits, as well as the in vivo bleeding time and clotting time in 
      mice. The pharmacodynamic differences between indobufen and warfarin sodium, 
      rivaroxaban, and dabigatran were further studied on thrombus formation and the 
      content of FII and FX in rats. Animal experiments showed that 
      intragastric-administrated indobufen can significantly reduce the APTT, PT, TT, 
      PF3, FI, II, V, VIII, and X plasma contents. Its inhibitory effect on plasma FII 
      was better than thrombin inhibitor dabigatran with effect on FX better than FXa 
      inhibitor rivaroxaban. These results suggest that indobufen has some 
      anticoagulant effects as strong as some conventional anticoagulants. The 
      mechanism may be related to both exogenous and endogenous coagulation system.

TI  - Estimation of Rivaroxaban Plasma Concentrations in the Perioperative Setting in 
      Patients With or Without Heparin Bridging.
PG  - 129-138
LID - 10.1177/1076029616675968 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Estimation of residual rivaroxaban plasma concentrations may be 
      requested before invasive procedures and some patients at high thromboembolic 
      risk will have a bridging therapy with heparins when rivaroxaban is interrupted. 
      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the performance of the 
      STA-Liquid Anti-Xa assay (STA LAX) and the low and normal procedures of the 
      Biophen Direct Factor Xa Inhibitors (DiXaI) assay, in patients with and without 
      bridging with low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Seventy-nine blood samples were collected from 77 patients on rivaroxaban at 
      C(TROUGH) or before an invasive procedure. Rivaroxaban plasma concentrations were 
      estimated using Biophen DiXaI, Biophen DiXaI LOW, and STA LAX and compared to 
      liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) measurements. 
      Stratifications were performed according to heparin bridging. RESULTS: The 
      Biophen DiXaI LOW and STA LAX showed better correlation with LC-MS/MS 
      measurements than Biophen DiXaI in patients not bridged with LMWH (R: 0.97, 0.96, 
      and 0.91, respectively). However, the performance of Biophen DiXaI LOW and STA 
      LAX decreased when residual LMWH activity was present (R: 0.18 and 0.19 
      respectively) demonstrating that these tests are not specific to rivaroxaban. 
      CONCLUSION: In patients not bridged with LMWH, we suggest to use the Biophen 
      DiXaI LOW and STA LAX for the estimation of rivaroxaban concentrations <50 ng/mL. 
      These results should be confirmed on a larger cohort of patients. Patients 
      bridged with LMWH have inaccurate estimates of low levels of rivaroxaban and the 
      3 assays studied should not be used to estimate if it is safe to perform a 
      procedure.

TI  - Effect of Activated Charcoal on Rivaroxaban Complex Absorption.
PG  - 793-801
LID - 10.1007/s40262-016-0485-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of activated charcoal (AC) on rivaroxaban 
      exposure in healthy volunteers. METHODS: This was an open-label study with an 
      incomplete cross-over design of single-dose rivaroxaban (40 mg) administered 
      alone or with AC in 12 healthy volunteers. The study comprised three treatment 
      periods in randomised sequence, one with rivaroxaban administered alone and two 
      with AC given at 2, 5 or 8 h post-dose. Rivaroxaban plasma concentration was 
      measured in blood samples drawn at 16 time points. The pharmacokinetic model of 
      rivaroxaban alone or with AC administration was built using a non-linear 
      mixed-effect modelling approach. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic model was based on 
      a one-compartment model with an absorption rate described by the sum of three 
      inverse Gaussian densities to reproduce multiphasic and prolonged absorption. The 
      inclusion in the model of each AC administration schedule significantly improved 
      objective function value. AC reduced the area under the rivaroxaban 
      concentration-time curve by 43% when administered 2 h post-dose, by 31% when 
      administered 5 h post-dose and by 29% when administered 8 h post-dose. Based on 
      the estimated pharmacokinetic model, simulations suggested that AC might have an 
      impact even after 8 h post-dose. CONCLUSION: AC administration significantly 
      reduces exposure to rivaroxaban even if AC is administered 8 h after rivaroxaban. 
      These results suggest that AC could be used in rivaroxaban overdose and 
      accidental ingestion to antagonise absorption. CLINICALTRIAL. GOV REGISTRATION

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal hematomas (SHs) are rare yet potentially debilitating causes 
      of acute back pain. Although spontaneous SHs have been described in the setting 
      of anticoagulation with warfarin or enoxaparin, few cases of spontaneous SH on 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been reported. CASE REPORT: We report a 
      case of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma in a patient on rivaroxaban. A 
      72-year-old man on rivaroxaban and aspirin presented with a 4-day history of 
      nontraumatic back pain. In the emergency department he developed lower-extremity 
      weakness and numbness, followed by urinary incontinence. Magnetic resonance 
      imaging revealed spinal epidural hematoma at T11-L2. The patient underwent 
      emergent decompression and hematoma evacuation and was discharged home 8 days 
      later with complete resolution of symptoms. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE 
      AWARE OF THIS?: Early recognition and surgical intervention for SHs with 
      neurologic compromise is key to favorable outcome. Optimal timing of surgery in 
      patients on DOACs requires an assessment of the risk of intraoperative or 
      postoperative bleeding, an assessment of the patient's symptom progression, as 
      well as an understanding of the pharmacokinetics of the DOAC used and possible 
      reversal options available. We also review all published cases of spontaneous SHs 
      in patients on DOACs and report on their management and outcomes.

      Does Not Fully Reflect Their Biologic Spectrum.

AB  - The currently available oral anti-Xa agents are claimed to produce their 
      anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects solely by the inhibition of factor Xa. 
      This study profiled various anti-Xa drugs in routinely used laboratory assays to 
      demonstrate that their effects are not solely related to the anti-Xa activities. 
      Apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban were obtained commercially. 
      Native and citrated whole blood was used for the activated clotting time (ACT) 
      and thromboelastography (TEG). Citrated plasma was used for monitoring the 
      prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), Heptest, and 
      prothrombinase-induced clotting time (PiCT) tests. An amidolytic method was used 
      for the determination of anti-Xa effects. Thrombin-induced fibrinokinetics was 
      monitored optically. Thrombin generation studies were carried out using the 
      calibrated automated thrombogram. All of the anti-Xa agents produced 
      concentration- and assay-dependent effects. In the ACT at 2.5 μg/mL and TEG at 
      1.0 μg/mL, edoxaban exhibited the strongest anticoagulation effect. In the PiCT, 
      PT, and aPTT assay at 1 μg/mL, edoxaban showed stronger effects than other 
      agents. The half maximal inhibitory concentration of these agents for the 
      inhibition of factor Xa ranged from 340 to >1000 ng/mL. In the thrombin 
      generation inhibition assay, apixaban showed the strongest activity. In the 
      fibrinokinetics, different anti-Xa agents produced varying degrees of inhibition. 
      These results demonstrate that the measured anti-Xa activity alone does not fully 
      reflect the overall biologic spectrum of these agents.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In Japan, low-dose rivaroxaban [15 mg QD/10 mg QD for creatinine 
      clearance of 30-49 mL/min] was approved for clinical use in NVAF patients partly 
      because of its unique pharmacokinetics in Japanese subjects. The aim of the study 
      was to determine the anticoagulation intensity of rivaroxaban and its determinant 
      factors in Japanese stroke patients. METHODS: Consecutive stroke patients with 
      NVAF admitted between July 2012 and December 2013 were studied. Prothrombin time 
      (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and estimated plasma 
      concentration of rivaroxaban (Criv) based on an anti-factor Xa chromogenic assay 
      were measured just before and 4 and 9 h after administration at the steady state 
      level of rivaroxaban. Determinant factors for Criv were explored using a linear 
      mixed-model approach. RESULTS: Of 110 patients (37 women, 75±9 years old), 59 
      took 15 mg QD of rivaroxaban and 51 took 10 mg QD. Criv at 4 h was 186 ng/mL for 
      patients taking 15 mg QD and 147 ng/mL for those taking 10 mg QD. Both PT and 
      aPTT were positively correlated with Criv. Criv was 72% lower at 4 h in 15 
      patients receiving crushed tablets than in the other patients, and tablet 
      crushing was significantly associated with lower Criv (adjusted estimate -0.43, 
      95% CI -0.60 to -0.26) after multivariate-adjustment. CONCLUSION: The 
      anticoagulation effects of rivaroxaban in the acute stroke setting for Japanese 
      NVAF patients were relatively low as compared with those in the ROCKET-AF and 
      J-ROCKET AF trials. Tablet crushing, common in dysphagic patients, decreased 
      Criv.

TI  - New oral anticoagulants and their implications for dental patients.
PG  - 137-43
AB  - Anticoagulation therapy is used in several conditions to prevent or treat 
      thromboembolism. Over the last 40 years, warfarin has been the oral anticoagulant 
      of choice and has been considered the mainstay of treatment. However, its use is 
      limited by a narrow therapeutic index and complex pharmacodynamics, necessitating 
      regular monitoring and dose adjustments. Recently, two new oral 
      anticoagulants--dabigatran etexilate (a direct thrombin inhibitor) and 
      rivaroxiban (a factor Xa inhibitor)--have been approved for use in North America 
      and Europe. Unlike warfarin, dabigatran and rivaroxiban are relatively small 
      molecules that work as anticoagulants by targeting specific single steps of the 
      coagulation cascade. Their advantages, relative to warfarin, include: predictable 
      pharmacokinetics; limited food and drug interactions; rapid onset of action; and, 
      short half-life. They require no monitoring. However, they lack a specific 
      reversal agent. The number of patients taking dabigatran and rivaroxaban is 
      increasing. Therefore, it is inevitable that dentists will be required to perform 
      invasive procedures on this cohort of patients. This paper outlines the various 
      properties of the new oral anticoagulants and the most recent guidelines 
      regarding the management of these dental patients taking these medications.

AB  - AIMS: The primary objective was to explore the pharmacodynamic changes during 
      transition from rivaroxaban to warfarin in healthy subjects. Safety, tolerability 
      and pharmacokinetics were assessed as secondary objectives. METHODS: An open 
      label, non-randomized, sequential two period study. In treatment period 1 (TP1), 
      subjects received rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (5 days), followed by 
      co-administration with a warfarin loading dose regimen of 5 or 10 mg (for the 
      10 mg regimen, the dose could be uptitrated to attain target international 
      normalized ratio [INR] ≥2.0) once daily (2-4 days). When trough INR values ≥2.0 
      were attained, rivaroxaban was discontinued and warfarin treatment continued as 
      monotherapy (INR 2.0-3.0). During treatment period 2, subjects received the same 
      warfarin regimen as in TP1, but without rivaroxaban. RESULTS: During 
      co-administration, maximum INR and prothrombin time (PT) values were higher than 
      with rivaroxaban or warfarin monotherapy. The mean maximum effect (Emax ) for INR 
      after co-administration was 2.79-4.15 (mean PT Emax 41.0-62.7 s), compared with 
      1.41-1.74 (mean PT Emax 20.1-25.2 s) for warfarin alone. However, rivaroxaban had 
      the smallest effect on INR at trough rivaroxaban concentrations. Neither 
      rivaroxaban nor warfarin significantly affected maximum plasma concentrations of 
      the other drug. CONCLUSIONS: The combined pharmacodynamic effects during 
      co-administration of rivaroxaban and warfarin were greater than additive, but the 
      pharmacokinetics of both drugs were unaffected. Co-administration was well 
      tolerated. When transitioning from rivaroxaban to warfarin, INR monitoring during 
      co-administration should be performed at the trough rivaroxaban concentration to 
      minimize the effect of rivaroxaban on INR.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor used in human thrombotic 
      disorders. In view of the in vitro concentration dependent anticoagulant effects 
      of rivaroxaban in dogs, the time course of its anticoagulant effects was 
      characterized in healthy dogs. Twenty-four healthy Beagles were randomized into 
      three groups (n = 8 per group) and received orally either a placebo or 20 mg 
      rivaroxaban once or twice at an 8 h interval. Fifteen blood samples were 
      collected over a 30 h period, and blindly assayed for prothrombin time (PT), 
      activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), tissue factor induced thrombin 
      generation (TG) and anti-factor Xa activity. Thromboelastography (TEG) was 
      evaluated at 0, 1, 4, 8 and 24 h. Peak/baseline anticoagulant effect ratios were 
      analyzed with generalized linear models using β distributions and times to return 
      to baseline with survival analyses (α = 0.05). Peak/baseline anticoagulant effect 
      ratios of PT, aPTT, anti-factor Xa activity, TG and R (TEG) differed 
      significantly between placebo and both rivaroxaban groups (P <0.0001). The peak 
      anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban occurred 1.5 to 2 h after dosing. The median 
      return to baseline occurred significantly sooner (P <0.01) with 20 mg rivaroxaban 
      administered once (7.9-18.7 h) versus twice (17.5-26.8 h). The inter-individual 
      variability differed amongst assays, but overall was moderate to large. No 
      adverse effects were recorded. Twice oral administration of 2 mg/kg rivaroxaban 
      at an 8 h interval maintained 24 h anticoagulant activity, but larger studies are 
      needed to establish guidelines for the use of rivaroxaban in dogs.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is a small-molecule, direct factor Xa inhibitor that is under 
      investigation for the prevention and treatment of venous and arterial thrombosis. 
      To date, oral anticoagulants have been limited largely to vitamin K antagonists. 
      Despite their remarkable benefits, vitamin K antagonists are limited by their 
      narrow therapeutic window, the existence of multiple food and drug interactions, 
      and the need for frequent monitoring and dose-adjustment. Rivaroxaban represents 
      a potentially attractive alternative to warfarin, as it could enable simplified 
      once-daily dosing, requires no therapeutic monitoring, and has a lower potential 
      for drug interactions. At present, the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban for the 
      prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism has been evaluated in 
      phase-II and phase-III trials involving over 24,000 patients. Rivaroxaban is also 
      being evaluated for the treatment of pulmonary embolism, secondary prevention 
      after acute coronary syndromes, and the prevention of stroke and non-central 
      nervous system embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The 
      need for new oral anticoagulants, the development and pharmacology of 
      rivaroxaban, results of completed studies of rivaroxaban, and details of ongoing 
      phase-II and phase-III trials with rivaroxaban are the subjects of this chapter.

TI  - Assessment of trough rivaroxaban concentrations on markers of coagulation 
      activation in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation population.
PG  - 609-617
LID - 10.1007/s00380-016-0912-0 [doi]
AB  - Whether trough-phase rivaroxaban concentrations provide sufficient 
      anticoagulation needs more study. We evaluated levels of coagulation activation 
      markers in the trough concentration phase in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation 
      (NVAF) patients, and the correlation between these markers and rivaroxaban 
      concentration. Fifty-five Japanese NVAF patients received 24-week rivaroxaban 
      treatment of either 15 or 10 mg once-daily in the morning. Of these, 26 patients 
      had no history of anticoagulant therapy (naive group) and 29 had switched from 
      warfarin (warfarin group). D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2) 
      levels, and protein C activities were measured at 0 (baseline), 12 and 24 weeks 
      of rivaroxaban treatment just before the patient's regular dosing time (trough 
      phase). For 49 patients, D-dimer, F1 + 2, and rivaroxaban concentrations were 
      also measured twice between 28 and 32 weeks of rivaroxaban treatment at 
      non-trough times to achieve a range of drug concentrations for correlation 
      analysis. For the naive group, D-dimer and F1 + 2 levels were significantly 
      reduced (p < 0.01) from baseline at 12 and 24 weeks. For the warfarin group, 
      these values were unchanged for D-dimer but significantly increased (p < 0.01) 
      for F1 + 2. Protein C activity was unchanged in the naive group and was increased 
      (p < 0.01) in the warfarin group. Prothrombin time (r = 0.92, p < 0.0001) and 
      activated partial thromboplastin time (r = 0.54, p < 0.0001) correlated with 
      rivaroxaban concentration, but not D-dimer and F1 + 2 levels. In conclusion, 
      rivaroxaban in the trough phase is comparable to warfarin in reducing D-dimer 
      levels. Although trough level rivaroxaban suppresses F1 + 2 less than warfarin, 
      the higher activities of protein C with rivaroxaban treatment compared to 
      warfarin treatment may counterbalance this. Lack of correlation between 
      rivaroxaban concentration and D-dimer and F1 + 2 levels suggests that trough 
      concentrations of rivaroxaban reduce their concentrations as effectively as 
      higher levels do.

TI  - Novel rivaroxaban-loaded microsphere systems with different surface 
      microstructure for enhanced oral bioavailability.

LID - 10.1007/s13346-023-01420-w [doi]
AB  - This study compares rivaroxaban-loaded polymeric microsphere systems with three 
      types of surface microstructure. Three types of polymeric microspheres loaded 
      with rivaroxaban were fabricated using a spray-drying technique: 
      solvent-evaporated, surface-attached, and solvent-wet microspheres, depending on 
      whether the drug and additives used are soluble in the solvent. The 
      solvent-evaporated and surface-attached microspheres had a 
      rivaroxaban/polyvinylpyrrolidone/sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) weight ratio of 
      1/0.25/2.2, and the solvent-wetted microspheres contained rivaroxaban/polyvinyl 
      alcohol/SLS in equal weight ratio (1/0.25/2). The physicochemical properties of 
      the microspheres were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray 
      diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and particle size distribution 
      analysis. The aqueous solubility and dissolution rate of rivaroxaban in the three 
      types of microspheres were compared to those of the drug powder. The 
      solvent-evaporated, surface-attached, and solvent-wetted microspheres were 
      approximately 208, 140, and 172 times as soluble as the drug powder, and the 
      final dissolution rate (120 min) was approximately 5, 2, and 4 times that of the 
      drug powder, respectively. In addition, the oral bioavailability increased by 
      approximately 2, 1.3, and 1.6 times compared to that of the drug powder (area 
      under drug concentration-time curve: 2101.3 ± 314.8, 1325.2 ± 333.3, and 
      1664.0 ± 102.6 h·ng/mL, respectively). Finally, the solvent-evaporated 
      microspheres showed the greatest improvement (solvent evaporating 
      microspheres > solvent wetted microspheres > surface-attached microspheres ≥ drug 
      powder). Therefore, the solvent-evaporated microspheres may represent a novel 
      oral dosage form that improves the oral bioavailability of rivaroxaban, a poorly 
      soluble drug.

TI  - Comparison of Anti-Xa Activity in Patients Receiving Apixaban or Rivaroxaban.
PG  - 251-256
LID - 10.1177/1060028017738262 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no established method for monitoring the anticoagulant 
      effects of apixaban and rivaroxaban. Linear correlation between serum levels and 
      anti-Xa activity has been shown, with r(2) ranging from 0.88 to 0.99. However, 
      there are minimal data in patients receiving apixaban 5 mg twice daily or 
      rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anti-Xa activity and 
      serum levels at those doses and compare the trough anti-Xa activity. METHODS: 
      This was a single-center prospective study,approved by the institutional review 
      board. Patients on an inappropriate dose or receiving an interacting drug were 
      excluded. Blood samples were drawn 0.5 to 3 hours before a dose for both agents, 
      2 to 3 hours after an apixaban dose, and 12 to 16 hours after a rivaroxaban dose. 
      Anti-Xa activity and serum levels were determined, and correlation was done via 
      regression analysis. Trough anti-Xa activity was compared using a t-test. 
      RESULTS: The study enrolled 88 patients receiving each drug. The r(2) values were 
      0.79 and 0.87 for apixaban and rivaroxaban, respectively. The mean trough anti-Xa 
      activity was 1.79 ± 0.96 IU/mL for apixaban and 1.25 ± 0.88 IU for rivaroxaban ( 
      P < 0.01). The trough sample was drawn a mean of 1.3 and 1.8 hours prior to the 
      next dose for apixaban and rivaroxaban, respectively ( P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Good correlation was shown between anti-Xa activity and serum levels. The 
      clinical utility of monitoring anti-Xa activity and the significance of the 
      difference in trough anti-Xa activity for these agents remains to be established.

TI  - Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants and Factors Influencing the Ischemic 
      and Bleeding Risk in Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: A Review of 
      Current Evidence.
PG  - 11-21
LID - 10.1097/FJC.0000000000000927 [doi]
AB  - Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are a widely prescribed 
      treatment to prevent stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and 
      a therapy and preventative measure to prevent recurrences following venous 
      thromboembolism. Optimal use of NOACs requires a thorough knowledge of the 
      pharmacology of these drugs, as well as an understanding of patient factors 
      affecting their use. The 4 NOACs-dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban 
      are available in a range of doses suitable for differing indications and with a 
      variety of dose reduction criteria. Identification of the correct dose is one of 
      the key challenges in the individualization of treatment. Elderly patients with 
      atrial fibrillation are at a greater risk of both ischemic and bleeding events 
      than younger patients. Consequently, it is essential to achieve balance in 
      anticoagulation strategies. Medication adherence to NOACs is important for safe 
      and effective treatment, particularly in elderly populations. A growing body of 
      evidence shows that once-daily dosing improves adherence and persistence to 
      therapy, without having an impact on bleeding risk.

TI  - Assessment of Dose Proportionality of Rivaroxaban Nanocrystals.
PG  - 228
LID - 10.1208/s12249-020-01776-z [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban (RXB) is a class II drug, according to the Biopharmaceutics 
      Classification System. Since its bioavailability is low at high doses, dose 
      proportionality is not achieved for pharmacokinetic parameters. However, when 
      taken with food, its bioavailability increases at high doses. In this study, 
      nanocrystal technology was used to increase the solubility and, hence, the 
      bioavailability of RXB. Pluronic F127, pharmacoat 603, and PVP K-30 were used as 
      stabilizers to prepare RXB nanosuspension, combining ball mill and high pressure 
      homogenization methods. Particle sizes of RXB in nanosuspension (formulation 
      A:348 nm; formulation B:403 nm) and nanocrystal formulations (formulation 
      A:1167 nm; formulation B:606 nm) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) compared 
      to those of bulk RXB. In both formulations, 80% of the drug dissolved in 30 min. 
      For dose proportionality evaluation, 3, 10, and 15 mg/kg of RXB nanosuspensions 
      (formulation B) were administered to rabbits. The dose proportionality for AUC 
      and C(max) of RXB nanocrystals was assessed by the power model, variance analysis 
      of pharmacokinetic parameters, linear regression, and equivalence criterion 
      methods. Dose proportionality for AUC was achieved at doses between 10-15 and 
      3-15 mg/kg. In conclusion, the preparation of a nanocrystal formulation of RXB 
      improved its dissolution rate and pharmacokinetic profile.

AB  - Vitamin K antagonists were the only class of oral anticoagulants available to 
      clinicians for decades. However, with the US Food and Drug Administration 
      approval of new oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and 
      apixaban, clinicians now have a broader choice. Given the recent approval and 
      availability of these medications, several questions arise while deciding which 
      of them would be best suited for a particular patient. This article provides a 
      concise review for clinicians entailing the main studies that evaluated the 
      efficacy and safety of these drugs, their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      properties, and a practical approach to their clinical use. For this review, we 
      conducted searches of PubMed and MEDLINE for articles published between January 
      1, 2000, and January 30, 2013, using the following search terms: oral 
      anticoagulants, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, novel anticoagulants, bleeding 
      complications, management of bleeding complications, pharmacodynamics, and 
      pharmacokinetics. Studies published in English were selected for inclusion in 
      this review, as were additional articles identified from bibliographies.

TI  - Integrated Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Rivaroxaban Across Multiple 
      Patient Populations.
PG  - 309-320
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12288 [doi]
AB  - The population pharmacokinetics (PK) of rivaroxaban have been evaluated in 
      several population-specific models. We developed an integrated population PK 
      model using pooled data from 4,918 patients in 7 clinical trials across all 
      approved indications. Effects of gender, age, and weight on apparent clearance 
      (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F), renal function, and 
      comedication on CL/F, and relative bioavailability as a function of dose (F) were 
      analyzed. Virtual subpopulations for exposure simulations were defined by age, 
      creatinine clearance (CrCL) and body mass index (BMI). Rivaroxaban PK were 
      adequately described by a one-compartment disposition model with a first-order 
      absorption rate constant. Significant effects of CrCL, use of comedications, and 
      study population on CL/F, age, weight, and gender on V/F, and dose on F were 
      identified. CrCL had a modest influence on exposure, whereas age and BMI had a 
      minor influence. The model was suitable to predict rivaroxaban exposure in 
      patient subgroups of special interest.

TI  - Development of immediate-release formulation with reliable absorption of 
      rivaroxaban in various meal regimes.
PG  - e13820
LID - 10.1111/cts.13820 [doi]
LID - e13820
AB  - The bioavailability of rivaroxaban at the higher doses (15 and 20 mg) is 
      considerably reduced when the drug is administered on an empty stomach. This can 
      lead to inadequate anticoagulant effect, and therefore, it is recommended to use 
      the higher doses at fed state. However, proper posology may represent a barrier 
      for some patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate innovative 
      rivaroxaban-containing formulations designed to eliminate the food effect to 
      ensure reliable absorption and thus to improve patient adherence with the 
      treatment. Three prototypes (Cocrystal, HPMCP and Kollidon) with rivaroxaban were 
      developed and their bioavailability and food effect in comparison to the 
      reference product was tested in open label, randomized, single oral dose, 
      crossover studies, where test products were administered under fasting and fed 
      conditions and the reference product was administered under fed conditions. 
      Comparable bioavailability for all tested prototypes both under fed and fasting 
      conditions was demonstrated as the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean 
      ratios for area under the concentration-time curve remained within the standard 
      acceptance range of 80.00%-125.00%. An innovative immediate release form of 
      rivaroxaban with no food effect on drug bioavailability has been developed, which 
      may represent an important step toward increasing adherence, improving treatment 
      outcome and reducing health care costs.

TI  - Effect of non-specific reversal agents on anticoagulant activity of dabigatran 
      and rivaroxaban: a randomised crossover ex vivo study in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 217-24
LID - 10.1160/TH12-03-0179 [doi]
AB  - The new anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban can be responsible for 
      haemorrhagic complications. As for any anticoagulant, bleeding management is 
      challenging. We aimed to test the effect of all putative haemostatic agents on 
      the anticoagulant activity of these new drugs using thrombin generation tests. In 
      an ex vivo study, 10 healthy white male subjects were randomised to receive 
      rivaroxaban (20 mg) or dabigatran (150 mg) in one oral administration. After a 
      two weeks washout period, they received the other anticoagulant. Venous blood 
      samples were collected just before drug administration (H0) and 2 hours 
      thereafter. Reversal of anticoagulation was tested in vitro using prothrombin 
      complex concentrate (PCC), rFVIIa or FEIBA® at various concentrations. 
      Rivaroxaban affects quantitative and kinetic parameters, including the endogenous 
      thrombin potential (ETP-AUC and more pronouncedly the thrombin peak), the 
      lag-time and time to peak. PCC strongly corrected ETP-AUC, whereas rFVIIa only 
      modified the kinetic parameters. FEIBA corrected all parameters. Dabigatran 
      specially affects the kinetics of thrombin generation with prolonged lag-time and 
      time to peak. Although PCC increased ETP-AUC, only rFVIIa and FEIBA corrected the 
      altered lag-time. For both anticoagulants, lower doses of FEIBA, corresponding to 
      a quarter to half the dose usually used, have potential reversal profile of 
      interest. In conclusion, some non-specific reversal agents appear to be able to 
      reverse the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban or dabigatran. However, 
      clinical evaluation is needed regarding haemorrhagic situations, and a meticulous 
      risk-benefit evaluation regarding their use in this context is required.

TI  - Rivaroxaban Precision Dosing Strategy for Real-World Atrial Fibrillation 
      Patients.
PG  - 777-784
LID - 10.1111/cts.12766 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is a direct-acting oral anticoagulant approved to prevent strokes in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation. Dosage recommendations are approved for all 
      adult patients to receive either 15 mg or 20 mg once daily depending upon renal 
      function. There are a number of reasons to believe rivaroxaban dosing could be 
      more effective and/or safer for more patients if increased dosing precision is 
      available. Because real-world patients are more diverse than those studied in 
      phase III clinical trials, we evaluated the extremes of creatinine clearance 
      (CrCl) on rivaroxaban clearance using a published population pharmacokinetic 
      model and applying exposure variation limits (±20%) based on published 
      literature. The proposed dosing recommendations are 10 mg once daily (CrCl 
      15-29 ml/min), 15 mg once daily (CrCl 30-69 ml/min), 10 mg twice daily (CrCl 
      70-159 ml/min), and 15 mg twice daily (CrCl 160-250 ml/min). These new dosing 
      recommendations should be prospectively tested for predictive accuracy and to 
      assess the impact on AF patient efficacy and safety.

AB  - A 71-year-old female with a history of pulmonary embolism treated with 
      rivaroxaban presented with acute onset shortness of breath, chest pain and 
      palpitations. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) revealed multiple 
      bilateral pulmonary emboli. The patient was concurrently prescribed carbamazepine 
      and was later diagnosed with recurrence of breast cancer during the admission. We 
      discuss common drug interactions pertinent to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      that can increase the risk of further venous thromboembolism. This case report 
      highlights the importance of reviewing patient medications when considering 
      anticoagulants and the need to raise awareness of these drug interactions among 
      clinicians when making their choice of anticoagulation. It also reinforces the 
      current lack of evidence for use of DOACs in patients with solid organ 
      malignancies.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of BAY 59-7939--an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor--in rats and 
      dogs.
PG  - 891-910
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of BAY 59-7939 - a novel, oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor - 
      were investigated in rats and dogs in support of preclinical safety studies and 
      clinical development. BAY 59-7939 was rapidly absorbed after oral dosing, with an 
      absolute bioavailability of 57-66% in rats, and 60-86% in dogs. Plasma 
      pharmacokinetics of BAY 59-7939 were linear across the investigated dose range 
      (1-10 mg kg(-1) in rats, 0.3-3 mg kg(-1) in dogs). Plasma clearance was low: 0.4 
      l kg(-1) h(-1) in rats and 0.3 l kg(-1) h(-1) in dogs; volume of distribution 
      (V(ss)) was moderate: 0.3 l kg(-1) in rats, and 0.4 l kg(-1) in dogs. The 
      elimination half-life after oral administration was short in both species 
      (0.9-2.3 h). Whole-body autoradiography showed moderate tissue affinity. No 
      retention or small volume enrichments of BAY 59-7939-related radioactivity were 
      observed. The plasma-protein binding of BAY 59-7939 was high, species dependent 
      and fully reversible. BAY 59-7939 was rapidly excreted in rats and dogs, and was 
      not irreversibly retained. A dual mode of excretion (biliary/faecal and renal) 
      was observed. In summary, BAY 59-7939 had a favourable, predictable 
      pharmacokinetic profile, with high oral bioavailability and a dual route of 
      excretion.

TI  - Bioequivalence Study of 2 Formulations of Rivaroxaban, a Narrow-Therapeutic-Index 
      Drug, in Healthy Chinese Subjects Under Fasting and Fed Conditions.
PG  - 346-352
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.742 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the bioequivalence (BE) of 2 formulations of the 
      10-mg rivaroxaban tablet. The study was a randomized, open-label, 4-period, 
      crossover study that included 28 healthy subjects in fasting or fed conditions. 
      The pharmacokinetic parameters were determined based on the concentrations of 
      rivaroxaban using high-performance liquid chromatography with a tandem mass 
      spectrometer detector. In each of the 4 study periods with fasting or fed 
      conditions, a single dose of test or reference product was administered. 
      Rivaroxaban concentrations in plasma were determined using a validated liquid 
      chromatography with a tandem mass spectrometer detector method. The 
      pharmacokinetic parameters assessed were the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC(0-t) , AUC(0-∞) ), the peak plasma concentration of 
      the drug (C(max) ), time to achieve C(max) , elimination half-life, 
      within-subject variability of test drug, and within-subject variability of 
      reference drug. The geometric mean ratio (90%CI) of the test drug/reference drug 
      for rivaroxaban was 90.38% to 103.60% for AUC(0-t) in fasting conditions and 
      90.13% to 100.42% in fed conditions. The AUC(0-∞) s were 89.94% to 102.50% and 
      90.14% to 100.45% under fasting and fed conditions, respectively. The C(max) 
      values were 90.58% to 105.01% and 96.36% to 108.07% in these 2 conditions, 
      respectively. All 90%CIs for test drug/reference drug geometric mean ratio were 
      ≤2.5. The 90%CIs for test/reference AUC ratio and C(max) ratio were within the 
      acceptable range for BE. There were no adverse events encountered during this BE 
      study. The study's results indicated that the 2 formulations of the rivaroxaban 
      tablet were bioequivalent.

AB  - The anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban, a direct inhibitor of activated factor X 
      (FX), might be influenced by its dosing time because the activity of the 
      coagulofibrinolytic system exhibits daily rhythmicity. In rats, FX activity 
      follows a 24-h rhythm with a peak in the middle of the light phase and a trough 
      at the beginning of the dark phase. Consistent with these findings, a single dose 
      of rivaroxaban had a stronger inhibitory effect on FX activity after dosing at 
      the beginning of the light phase than after dosing at the beginning of the dark 
      phase. A similar chronopharmacological effect was seen in a quantitative model of 
      venous stasis thrombosis. In comparison, the dosing time had minimal influence on 
      the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. These data indicate that the anticoagulant 
      effect of rivaroxaban is influenced by the dosing time. Further studies should 
      confirm this finding in a clinical setting.

TI  - Comparative Bleeding Risk of Brand Vs Generic Rivaroxaban in Elderly Inpatients 
      with Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 1573-1582
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S459658 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common abnormal heart rhythm in 
      elderly patients. Rivaroxaban has been widely used for stroke prevention. The 
      anticoagulant response to rivaroxaban increases with age, which may make elderly 
      patients susceptible to adverse outcomes resulting from small differences in 
      bioavailability between generic and brand products. METHODS: We designed a cohort 
      study of ≥65-year-old inpatients with AF. Sociodemographic and laboratory 
      measures of qualified patients who received brand or generic rivaroxaban for at 
      least 72 hours at the study hospital from January 2021 to June 2023 were 
      collected retrospectively. The primary outcome was the incidence of bleeding. 
      RESULTS: A total of 1008 qualifying patients were included for analysis, with 626 
      (62.1%) receiving brand rivaroxaban and 382 (37.9%) receiving generic 
      rivaroxaban. After propensity score matching and weighting to account for 
      confounders, the odds ratios comparing brand vs generic rivaroxaban (95% 
      confidence intervals) for the bleeding was 1.15 (0.72-1.82). Results from 
      subgroup analyses of patients with age ≥85, HAS-BLED score ≥ 3, containment of 
      antiplatelet drugs, and female patients were consistent with the primary 
      analysis. CONCLUSION: It provides evidence regarding the clinical safety outcome 
      of generic rivaroxaban in the elderly AF population that may be particularly 
      susceptible to adverse outcomes resulting from small allowable differences in 
      pharmacokinetics.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Current anticoagulation therapy in children is less than ideal, 
      requiring regular venous monitoring and dosing adjustments. Limitations 
      associated with conventional anticoagulants have prompted the development of 
      novel drugs that specifically target key proteins in the coagulation system. 
      Rivaroxaban is the first oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor available for the 
      prevention of venous thromboembolism in adults. Its predictable pharmacokinetic 
      profile, high oral bioavailability and once-daily dosing make rivaroxaban an 
      optimal anticoagulant that warrants investigation in children. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the age-related anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban in 
      vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Age-specific plasma pools were created (i.e. 28 
      days-23 months, 2-6, 7-11, 12-16 years and adults) and spiked with increasing 
      concentrations of rivaroxaban (0-500 ng/ml). Commercially available PT, APTT and 
      anti-Factor Xa assays, as well as sub-sampling thrombin generation assays, were 
      used to measure rivaroxaban effect. RESULTS: The results of this study indicate 
      that there are no significant differences in rivaroxaban effect across the age 
      groups in vitro. CONCLUSION: In vivo studies are required to confirm the 
      consistency of dose-response across the paediatric age groups.

AB  - PURPOSE: Rivaroxaban, an oral anticoagulant, undergoes the metabolism mediated by 
      human cytochrome P450 (CYP). The present study is to quantitatively analyze and 
      compare the contributions of multiple CYPs in the metabolism of rivaroxaban to 
      provide new information for medication safety. METHODS: The metabolic stability 
      of rivaroxaban in the presence of human liver microsomes (HLMs) and recombinant 
      CYPs was systematically evaluated to estimate the participation of various CYP 
      isoforms. Furthermore, the catalytic efficiency of CYP isoforms was compared via 
      metabolic kinetic studies of rivaroxaban with recombinant CYP isoenzymes, as well 
      as via CYP-specific inhibitory studies. Additionally, docking simulations were 
      used to illustrate molecular interactions. RESULTS: Multiple CYP isoforms were 
      involved in the hydroxylation of rivaroxaban, with decreasing catalytic rates as 
      follows: CYP2J2 > 3A4 > 2D6 > 4F3 > 1A1 > 3A5 > 3A7 > 2A6 > 2E1 > 2C9 > 2C19. 
      Among the CYPs, 2J2, 3A4, 2D6, and 4F3 were the four major isoforms responsible 
      for rivaroxaban metabolism. Notably, the intrinsic clearance of rivaroxaban 
      catalyzed by CYP2J2 was nearly 39-, 64-, and 100-fold that catalyzed by CYP3A4, 
      2D6, and 4F3, respectively. In addition, rivaroxaban hydroxylation was inhibited 
      by 41.1% in the presence of the CYP2J2-specific inhibitor danazol, which was 
      comparable to the inhibition rate of 43.3% by the CYP3A-specific inhibitor 
      ketoconazole in mixed HLMs. Furthermore, molecular simulations showed that 
      rivaroxaban is principally bound to CYP2J2 by π-alkyl bonds, carbon-hydrogen 
      bonds, and alkyl interactions. CONCLUSION: CYP2J2 dominated the hydroxylation of 
      rivaroxaban, which may provide new insight into clinical drug interactions 
      involving rivaroxaban.

PG  - 622-630
LID - 10.33963/KP.a2021.0021 [doi]
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban, are widely used for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism 
      in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation as well as for prevention and 
      treatment of venous thromboembolism. Although DOACs do not require routine 
      laboratory monitoring of anticoagulant effect, there are special situations in 
      which laboratory assessment may be warranted. Laboratory tests include 
      quantitative assays, which measure plasma DOAC levels, and qualitative or 
      semi-quantitative assays, which may be used to screen for the presence of 
      clinically relevant DOAC levels. Indications for laboratory assessment include 
      emergent indications (serious bleeding, urgent surgery, acute ischemic stroke 
      with consideration of thrombolysis) and elective indications (extremes of 
      bodyweight, renal hypo- or hyperfunction, liver disease, suspected drug-drug 
      interactions, suspected gastrointestinal malabsorption). In general, quantitative 
      assays that measure DOAC levels may be used for elective indications, whereas 
      screening assays may be necessary for emergent indications if a quantitative 
      assay with sufficiently rapid turnaround time is not available. Therapeutic 
      ranges for DOACs have not been defined. In lieu of therapeutic ranges, data from 
      pharmacokinetic studies may be used to determine whether a patient's plasma DOAC 
      level falls within the expected range. If it does not, a change in therapy may be 
      warranted. Depending on the clinical scenario, a change in therapy may involve 
      adjustment of the DOAC dose, a change to a different DOAC, or a change to a 
      different class of anticoagulant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-Xa activity (AXA) in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF) and relationship to bleeding events remains unclear. METHODS: 
      We evaluated AXA in 94 patients at both trough and peak rivaroxaban 
      concentrations. Rivaroxaban dosage was determined according to creatinine 
      clearance (CrCl): 10 and 15mg once daily for patients with CrCl 15-49 and CrCl 
      ≥50mL/min, respectively. AXA value distribution and its association with bleeding 
      events were examined in enrolled subjects. RESULTS: The mean peak AXA level was 
      significantly higher than the mean trough level (1.98±0.81 vs. 0.16±0.15IU/mL; 
      p<0.001). The peak AXA level significantly differed among patients with CrCl 
      15-29, 30-49, 50-79, and ≥80mL/min (2.51±0.83, 1.72±0.76, 2.05±0.82, and 
      1.66±0.51IU/mL, respectively; p=0.004). Major and non-major clinically relevant 
      bleeding events occurred in 22 patients (23.4% and 14.6% per year, respectively). 
      The mean peak AXA level was significantly higher in patients who experienced 
      bleeding events than in those who did not (2.40±0.70 vs. 1.84±0.80IU/mL; 
      p=0.001). A Cox multivariate analysis showed that the peak AXA level was 
      independently related to the incidence of major and non-major clinically relevant 
      bleeding events (p=0.012). Cumulative bleeding rates were significantly higher in 
      patients with high peak AXA levels (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Peak AXA level was an 
      independent predictor for bleeding events in Japanese NVAF patients receiving 
      rivaroxaban.

      an in vitro survey.
PG  - 3014-3026
LID - 10.1111/trf.14933 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncontrollable bleeding is the leading cause of death in 
      traumatically injured patients. The extent to which direct factor Xa inhibitors 
      interfere with the applied resuscitation measures is presently unknown. STUDY 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effect of the 
      resuscitation fluids saline, albumin, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 
      solvent/detergent (S/D)-treated plasma, fibrinogen concentrate, prothrombin 
      complex concentrate (PCC), and combinations thereof on the hemostatic profile of 
      rivaroxaban-anticoagulated whole blood and plasma. We used rivaroxaban-spiked 
      whole blood and plasma from healthy donors, as well as plasma from patients on 
      rivaroxaban, and mimicked a resuscitation approach in a 50% plasma dilution 
      setting. Thromboelastography, thrombin generation, and fibrin generation clot 
      lysis test were assessed using tissue factor to initiate coagulation and tissue 
      plasminogen activator to induce clot lysis. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban resulted in a 
      hypocoagulant state that remained largely unaltered upon subsequent 50% dilution 
      with S/D-treated plasma or FFP. Using S/D-treated plasma as a diluent, clot 
      stability decreased due to its low α(2) -antiplasmin. Dilution with saline and 
      albumin induced a profibrinolytic state and further deteriorated the impaired 
      hemostatic potential of rivaroxaban-anticoagulated blood, even after PCC and 
      fibrinogen support. Combined use of plasma (either FFP or S/D treated) and PCC, 
      however, considerably improved both coagulation and clot stability. CONCLUSION: 
      In the setting of rivaroxaban anticoagulation and major blood loss, transfusing 
      plasma together with PCC may provide the most effective resuscitation approach 
      with the notion that additional antifibrinolytic drug support (e.g., tranexamic 
      acid) is likely required.

TI  - Practical recommendations on incorporating new oral anticoagulants into routine 
      practice.
PG  - 675-83
AB  - The use of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is expected to rise significantly in 
      upcoming years. Therefore, it is important to understand the potential uses, side 
      effects, and management of these agents in routine practice. NOACs have major 
      pharmacologic advantages over warfarin, including a rapid onset and offset of 
      action, fewer drug interactions, and predictable pharmacokinetics. These agents 
      are gaining popularity among both physicians and patients because of their ease 
      of administration and the advantage of eliminating the requirement for regular 
      coagulation monitoring. NOACs work to prevent and treat thrombosis by targeting 
      either thrombin (as with dabigatran) or factor Xa (as with rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban). In this review, we discuss practical recommendations for the use of 
      NOACs and the risks and benefits of incorporating them into routine practice.

TI  - Direct oral anticoagulants and heparins: laboratory values and pitfalls in 
      'bridging therapy'.
PG  - 624-632
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezw368 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The three direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) dabigatran, apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban are now widely used in clinical practice. For patients requiring 
      perioperative interruption of DOACs, heparin bridging is still under discussion. 
      Here we show, for the first time, the influence of concomitantly used DOACs and 
      heparins on laboratory assays. METHODS: For spiking experiments, 10 healthy 
      donors and nine patients treated with DOACs were investigated. The measurement of 
      DOACs and heparins was performed with routine methods on the ACL TOP [HEMOCLOT ® 
      direct thrombin inhibitor (CoaChrom Diagnostica, Austria), COAMATIC ® Heparin 
      (Chromogenix, USA) calibrated with rivaroxaban, apixaban, unfractionated heparin 
      (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), additionally PT reagent 
      RecombiPlasTin 2G and aPTT reagent SynthASil (Instrumentation Laboratory, 
      Germany)] and the DOACs were additionally quantified with liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry. A linear regression model has been used to 
      estimate the effect of DOAC prestimulation. RESULTS: No influence of dabigatran 
      could be demonstrated in the anti-Xa testing methods for LMWH, UFH, rivaroxaban 
      or apixaban. All FXa-inhibiting drugs affected all the anti-Xa testing methods in 
      their own specific ways. Compared with heparin alone, measurement of heparins in 
      samples with a basic concentration of DOACs (200 ng/ml) displays a more dramatic 
      increase. Samples of patients with therapeutic intake of DOACs spiked with UFH 
      and LMWH showed the expected pharmacokinetic profiles, but increased 
      pharmacodynamic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Direct thrombin and FXa inhibitors exhibit 
      distinct effects on assay results when used concomitantly with heparins. These 
      interactions must be considered in the interpretation of assay results during 
      bridging therapy.

TI  - Muscle Mass and Direct Oral Anticoagulant Activity in Older Adults With Atrial 
      Fibrillation.
PG  - 1012-1018
LID - 10.1111/jgs.16992 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are hydrophilic drugs with plasma 
      levels inversely proportional to lean body mass. Sarcopenic patients with low 
      muscle mass may be at risk for supra-therapeutic DOAC levels and bleeding 
      complications. We therefore sought to examine the influence of lean body mass on 
      DOAC levels in older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: A prospective 
      cohort study was conducted with patients 65 years of age or more receiving 
      rivaroxaban or apixaban for AF. Appendicular lean mass (ALM) was measured using a 
      bioimpedance device and a dual X-ray absorptiometry scanner. DOAC levels were 
      measured using a standardized anti-Xa assay 4 hours after (peak) and 1 hour 
      before (trough) ingestion. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 62 patients (47% 
      female, 77.0 ± 6.1 years). The prescribed DOACs were apixaban 2.5 mg (21%), 
      apixaban 5 mg (53%), and rivaroxaban 20 mg (26%). Overall, 16% had 
      supra-therapeutic DOAC levels at trough and 25% at peak. In the multivariable 
      logistic regression model, lower ALM was independently associated with 
      supra-therapeutic DOAC levels at trough (odds ratio per ↓ 1-kg 1.23, 95% 
      confidence interval 1.02 to 1.49) and peak (odds ratio per ↓ 1-kg 1.18, 95% 
      confidence interval 1.02 to 1.37). Addition of ALM to a model consisting of age, 
      total body weight, and renal function resulted in improved discrimination for 
      supra-therapeutic DOAC levels. CONCLUSION: Our proof-of-concept study has 
      identified an association between ALM and DOAC levels in older adults with AF. 
      Further research is needed to determine the impact of ALM on bleeding 
      complications and the potential role of ALM-guided dosing for sarcopenic 
      patients.

TI  - Rivaroxaban. A novel, oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor in clinical development 
      for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders.
PG  - 282-9
AB  - Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is a novel, oral, direct Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor in 
      late-stage development for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic 
      disorders. Rivaroxaban inhibits clot-associated and free FXa activity, and 
      prothrombinase activity, and reduces thrombin generation. In animal models, 
      rivaroxaban prevented venous and arterial thrombosis, and was effective at 
      treating venous thrombosis. Rivaroxaban has high oral bioavailability, a rapid 
      onset of action and predictable pharmacokinetics. In phase II studies, 
      rivaroxaban was effective and well tolerated for the prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) after major orthopaedic surgery, and for the treatment of 
      deep vein thrombosis. In a phase III study, rivaroxaban demonstrated 
      significantly superior efficacy to enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after total 
      knee arthroplasty, with similar low bleeding. Rivaroxaban is also being assessed 
      for the treatment and secondary prevention of VTE, prevention of stroke in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation and secondary prevention in patients with acute 
      coronary syndrome. Rivaroxaban is a promising alternative to current 
      pharmacological agents for thromboembolic disorders.

LID - 10.1177/0091270009355814 [doi]
AB  - Interpatient variability in the safety and efficacy of oral anticoagulation with 
      warfarin presents several challenges to clinicians, thus underscoring the 
      emergent need for new orally available anticoagulants with predictable 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and ability to target circulating 
      clotting factors. Seven compounds including rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, 
      and eribaxaban are orally available direct inhibitors of activated factor X 
      currently in development for the prevention and treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism and for thromboprophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation 
      or following an acute coronary syndrome. At doses used in phase 2 and 3 clinical 
      trials, rivaroxaban and apixaban demonstrated a predictable onset of effect, 
      maximal plasma concentration, and half-life that was unaffected by age, renal, or 
      hepatic disease. In clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism, rivaroxaban and apixaban produced equivalent or superior 
      reductions in the development or progression of venous thromboembolism compared 
      with either low molecular weight heparin or warfarin. Trials comparing the 
      efficacy of rivaroxaban or apixaban to standard therapy for stroke prophylaxis in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation are in process. Rivaroxaban, the sentinel 
      compound in this class, is already approved in the European Union and Canada. It 
      is likely to be approved for use in the United States in 2010.

TI  - Comparison of three-factor and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates 
      regarding reversal of the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - 1428-36
LID - 10.1111/jth.12599 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), which contain 
      factor II, FVII, FIX, and FX, have shown the potential to reverse the 
      anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban in healthy volunteers. The purpose of this 
      study was to determine whether a three-factor PCC, which contains little FVII, 
      has a similar effect. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed an open-label, 
      single-center, parallel-group study comparing the effect of a three-factor PCC 
      (Profilnine SD) with that of a four-factor PCC (Beriplex P/N) on the 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in 35 healthy volunteers. After receiving 4 days 
      of rivaroxaban 20 mg twice daily to obtain supratherapeutic steady-state 
      concentrations, volunteers were randomized to receive a single 50 IU kg(-1) bolus 
      dose of four-factor PCC, three-factor PCC or saline 4 h after the morning dose of 
      rivaroxaban on day 5, and the effects of these interventions on prothrombin time 
      and thrombin generation were determined. Within 30 min, four-factor PCC reduced 
      mean prothrombin time by 2.5-3.5 s, whereas three-factor PCC produced only a 
      0.6-1.0-s reduction. In contrast, three-factor PCC reversed rivaroxaban-induced 
      changes in thrombin generation more than four-factor PCC. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrates the potential of both three-factor and four-factor PCCs to at least 
      partially reverse the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban in healthy adults. The 
      discrepant effects of the PCC preparations may reflect differences in the 
      procoagulant components present in each.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery (BS) induces significant changes in 
      gastrointestinal anatomy, potentially influencing the pharmacokinetics of orally 
      administered drugs such as rivaroxaban. OBJECTIVES: This phase 1 study aimed to 
      assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of full-dose rivaroxaban in post-BS 
      patients. METHODS: The ABSORB (Rivaroxaban Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
      After Bariatric Surgery and in Morbid Obesity) study was a single-center, 
      nonrandomized, multiple-dose, parallel-design bioequivalence trial. Adult 
      patients with stable weight after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve 
      gastrectomy (SG) were compared with subjects with class III obesity and healthy 
      controls. Participants received 20 mg of rivaroxaban daily for 8 days. RESULTS: 
      Post-BS patients exhibited altered rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics, suggesting 
      reduced absorption. Mean area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 
      24 hours after the first dose (RYGB, 1806.8 ng.h/mL; SG, 1648.9 ng.h/mL) was 
      lower compared with that in controls (1893.5 ng.h/mL). At steady state, the area 
      under the concentration-time curve values remained lower in BS groups (RYGB, 
      2129.9 ng.h/mL; SG, 1946.4 ng.h/mL) than in controls (2224.8 ng.h/mL). The 
      maximum concentration after the first dose was lower in post-RYGB subjects (214.9 
      ng/mL) than in controls (264.1 ng/mL). This difference was less pronounced at 
      steady state (RYGB, 256.9 ng/mL vs controls, 288.8 ng/mL). Neither BS group met 
      bioequivalence criteria compared with controls, whereas the group with class III 
      obesity met bioequivalence criteria compared with controls at steady state. 
      CONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban displayed minor pharmacokinetic variations in post-BS 
      patients. Given reported interindividual variability in the general population, 
      these variations are unlikely to be of clinical significance. Our findings 
      support rivaroxaban use in BS patients, emphasizing the need for further research 
      in this area.

TI  - The in-vitro anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban in neonates.
PG  - 237-40
LID - 10.1097/MBC.0000000000000033 [doi]
AB  - The use of anticoagulants in neonates is increasing because of the medical 
      advances improving the long-term survival of very sick infants who are at risk of 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE). Current anticoagulation therapy in neonates is less 
      than ideal, because of the physiological differences compared to children and 
      adults regarding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and pharmacology of the drug. 
      Limitations associated with conventional anticoagulants have prompted the 
      development of novel drugs that specifically target the key proteins in the 
      coagulation system. Rivaroxaban is the first oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor 
      available for the prevention of VTE in adults. Its predictable pharmacokinetic 
      profile, high oral bioavailability and once-daily dosing make rivaroxaban an 
      optimal anticoagulant that warrants investigation in neonates. This study was 
      designed to determine whether there are age-related differences in the 
      pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban in vitro amongst neonates. Neonatal and 
      adult plasma pools were created and spiked with increasing concentrations of 
      rivaroxaban (0-500 ng/ml). Commercially available prothrombin time (PT), 
      activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and anti-Factor Xa assays as well as 
      a sub-sampling thrombin generation assay were used to measure the rivaroxaban 
      effect. A dose-dependent response was observed for PT, aPTT and lag time in both 
      the age groups. Rivaroxaban caused a significant increase in the clotting time 
      for PT and aPTT as well as an increase in lag time (as measured by thrombin 
      generation) in neonates when compared with adults. In-vivo studies are required 
      to confirm the consistency of dose-response in neonates.

TI  - Rivaroxaban Treatment in Two Breastfeeding Mothers: A Case Series.
PG  - 41-43
LID - 10.1089/bfm.2019.0124 [doi]
AB  - Background: Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is a reversible direct factor Xa inhibitor used 
      for the treatment and prevention of coagulation in numerous syndromes. There is 
      very limited information available on the transfer of rivaroxaban into human 
      breast milk. Case Report: This study determined the drug concentration-time 
      profile of rivaroxaban in milk samples collected from two lactating mothers 
      consuming 15 mg twice daily. After 21 days, each mother transitioned to 20 mg 
      once daily. Levels in milk were measured using liquid chromatography mass 
      spectrometry and analysis was done for both dosages. The maximum concentration of 
      rivaroxaban observed for the 15 mg dose was 0.3 ± 0.02 μg/mL and that for the 
      20 mg dose was 0.26 ± 0.01 μg/mL. The relative infant dose (RID) was calculated 
      to be 5% and 4%, respectively. Discussion: This relatively low infant dose is 
      probably explained by the high plasma protein binding of rivaroxaban and its 
      subsequent poor penetration into human milk. The results indicate that 
      rivaroxaban receded to minimum concentration over a period of 12 hours. 
      Conclusions: In these two cases, we found the levels of rivaroxaban in milk to be 
      quite low, and the RID to be 5% of the maternal dose. Although the levels 
      detected were low, rivaroxaban does transfer into breast milk. Caution should be 
      exercised until further studies are conducted and report the safety profile of 
      rivaroxaban in breastfeeding infants.

AB  - Novel oral anticoagulants, direct thrombin inhibitors, and factor Xa inhibitors 
      are being introduced into clinical practice. In contrast to vitamin K 
      antagonists, such as warfarin, these novel agents, because of their relatively 
      wide therapeutic range and predictable pharmacokinetics, have been evaluated in 
      clinical trials and approved for clinical use without the need for routine 
      coagulation monitoring. On occasion, it will be important to assess the 
      anticoagulant status of patients treated with these agents. As a result of their 
      targeted mechanisms of action, they affect standard coagulation assays 
      differently than vitamin K antagonists and heparins, and such assay results may 
      not provide clinically useful information. Thus, less commonly used coagulation 
      assays (eg, chromogenic anti-factor Xa activity assays, diluted thrombin time, 
      and ecarin-based clotting tests) may be introduced into clinical practice. These 
      assays are currently limited by the absence of validated therapeutic targets and 
      lack of standardization across laboratories, vendors, and medication classes. 
      This article provides an overview of the coagulation assays and their potential 
      role in determining the anticoagulant status of patients treated with the 
      emerging anticoagulants.

TI  - Impact of Drug Interactions on Major Bleed Rates in Patients Taking Direct Oral 
      Anticoagulants.
PG  - 600-605
LID - 10.1177/08971900211059411 [doi]
AB  - Background: While direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have less stringent 
      monitoring, favorable pharmacokinetics, and fewer drug interactions compared to 
      warfarin, there is still a potential for drug-drug interactions. There is limited 
      evidence showing total impact of DOAC drug interactions on major bleeding events. 
      Methods: This was an IRB-approved retrospective, case control, single center 
      study. Patients were included if they had received a DOAC from January 2012 to 
      September 2019 and were identified for major bleeding events and matched to a 
      control group. The primary objective was to compare the presence of major drug 
      interactions between patients on DOACs who did and did not have a major bleeding 
      event. The secondary objectives were to compare the impact of specific 
      interacting drug classes and their additive effects on major bleeding events. 
      Results: There were 122 patients included in the study. While the number of 
      patients on at least one interacting medication within duration of DOAC use was 
      numerically higher in the bleed group (85% vs 72%), this was not significant (P = 
      .077). There were significantly more patients on at least three interacting 
      medications within the last 3 months of the study period in the bleed group (n = 
      9 vs 1), with significantly higher use of aspirin (n = 38 vs 17) and rate control 
      agents (n = 24 vs 11). Conclusion: There may be a cumulative effect on risk of 
      bleeding if patients are on three or more interacting medications concomitantly 
      with a DOAC. This risk of bleeding may be higher with aspirin and rate control 
      agents.

TI  - Coming full circle: The potential utility of real-world evidence to discern 
      predictions from a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model.
PG  - 344-347
LID - 10.1002/bdd.2369 [doi]
AB  - Today real word data (RWD) are playing a greater role in informing health care 
      decisions. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK) and observed 
      exposure-risk relationship predicted an increased bleeding risk induced by 
      rivaroxaban (RXB) in patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      taking concomitant medications that are combined Pgp-CYP3A inhibitors. In this 
      commentary, we explore the potential use of RWD to assess the clinical 
      consequence of this complex drug-drug interaction predicted from PBPK. This is a 
      retrospective, case control, pilot study using a RWD dataset of 896,728 patients 
      with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease and rivaroxaban use that was refined 
      based upon combined Pgp-CYP3A inhibitor exposure and report of drug-induced 
      bleeding (DIB). The odds ratio of patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney 
      disease taking rivaroxaban with or without concurrent Pgp-CYP3A inhibitor use 
      having a DIB was calculated. The odds ratio for DIB was 2.04 (CI(95) 1.82, 2.3; 
      p < 0.001) suggesting an approximate doubling of bleeding risk which is 
      consistent with the rivaroxaban exposure changes predicted by the published PBPK 
      model and observed exposure-risk relationship. This exploratory analysis 
      demonstrated the potential utility of RWD to assess model-based predictions as 
      part of a drugs life cycle management.

TI  - Rivaroxaban reversal with prothrombin complex concentrate or tranexamic acid in 
      healthy volunteers.
PG  - 54-64
LID - 10.1111/jth.13894 [doi]
AB  - Essentials Specific reversal agents for managing severe factor Xa 
      inhibitor-associated bleeding are lacking. We assessed 4-factor-prothrombin 
      complex concentrate (4F-PCC) and tranexamic acid (TXA). 4F-PCC, but not TXA, 
      reduced the prothrombin time and increased endogenous thrombin potential. These 
      agents may be viable options for reversal of therapeutic doses of rivaroxaban. 
      SUMMARY: Background Oral activated factor X inhibitors such as rivaroxaban are 
      widely used, but specific reversal agents are lacking. Although four-factor 
      prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) and tranexamic acid (TXA) are sometimes 
      used to manage serious bleeding, their efficacy is unknown. Prior studies in 
      healthy subjects taking rivaroxaban revealed that 4F-PCC partially reverses the 
      prolonged prothrombin time (PT), and fully restores the endogenous thrombin 
      potential (ETP). The effect of TXA has not been evaluated. Methods In this 
      double-blind, parallel-group study, 147 healthy volunteers given rivaroxaban 20 
      mg twice daily for 3 days were randomized after their morning dose on day 4 to 
      receive intravenous 4F-PCC (50 IU kg(-1) ), TXA (1.0 g), or saline. Standardized 
      punch biopsies were performed at baseline and after 4F-PCC, TXA or saline 
      administration. Reversal was assessed by measuring bleeding duration and bleeding 
      volume at biopsy sites, and by determining the PT and ETP. Results As compared 
      with saline, 4F-PCC partially reversed the PT and completely reversed the ETP, 
      whereas TXA had no effect. Neither 4F-PCC nor TXA reduced bleeding duration or 
      volume. All treatments were well tolerated, with no recorded adverse events. 
      Conclusions Although 4F-PCC reduced the PT and increased the ETP in volunteers 
      given supratherapeutic doses of rivaroxaban, neither 4F-PCC nor TXA influenced 
      punch biopsy bleeding.

TI  - In Vitro Evaluation of P-gp-Mediated Drug-Drug Interactions Using the RPTEC/TERT1 
      Human Renal Cell Model.
PG  - 223-233
LID - 10.1007/s13318-021-00744-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In vitro evaluation of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
      inhibitory potential is an important issue when predicting clinically relevant 
      drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Located within all physiological barriers, 
      including intestine, liver, and kidneys, P-gp plays a major role in the 
      pharmacokinetics of various therapeutic classes. However, few data are available 
      about DDIs involving renal transporters during the active tubular secretion of 
      drugs. In this context, the present study was designed to investigate the 
      application of the human renal cell line RPTEC/TERT1 to study drug interactions 
      mediated by P-gp. METHODS: The P-gp inhibitory potentials of a panel of drugs 
      were first determined by measuring the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 
      123 in RPTEC/TERT1 cells. Then four drugs were selected to assess the 
      half-maximal inhibitor concentration (IC50) values by measuring the intracellular 
      accumulation of two P-gp-substrate drugs, apixaban and rivaroxaban. Finally, 
      according to the FDA guidelines, the [I(1)]/IC50 ratio was calculated for each 
      combination of drugs to assess the clinical relevance of the DDIs. RESULTS: The 
      data showed that drugs which are known P-gp inhibitors, including cyclosporin A, 
      ketoconazole, and verapamil, caused great increases in rhodamine 123 retention, 
      whereas noninhibitors did not affect the intracellular accumulation of the P-gp 
      substrate. The determined IC50 values were in accordance with the inhibition 
      profiles observed in the rhodamine 123 accumulation assays, confirming the 
      reliability of the RPTEC/TERT1 model. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the data 
      demonstrate the feasibility of the application of the RPTEC/TERT1 model for 
      evaluating the P-gp inhibitory potentials of drugs and consequently predicting 
      renal drug interactions.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are increasingly common, with bleeding events 
      associated with elevated plasma concentrations. Rotational thromboelastometry 
      (ROTEM), a point-of-care tool for assessing secondary hemostasis, has 
      demonstrated a correlation with increasing concentrations of DOAC. However, 
      previous studies have only partially explored this relationship. The primary aim 
      in the current study was to investigate the impact of increasing rivaroxaban 
      concentrations on clotting time (CT) in the EXTEM assay. The secondary aims were 
      to investigate the impact of increasing rivaroxaban concentrations on clot 
      formation time (CFT) and α-angle (AA) and to investigate the impact of increasing 
      concentrations of dabigatran and apixaban on CT, CFT and AA. Blood from 12 
      healthy volunteers was spiked to anticipated concentrations of rivaroxaban, 
      dabigatran and apixaban at 0, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 µg/L each. Blood with 
      these varying concentrations was analyzed in four different ROTEM assays and CT, 
      CFT and AA were extracted. CT increased linearly with increasing concentrations 
      of all three DOACs. Rivaroxaban and dabigatran spiked blood showed an increase in 
      CT-EXTEM for the 200-1000µg/L concentrations, compared to baseline, and apixaban 
      for the 500-1000 µg/L concentrations. CFT and AA were affected only in 
      supratherapeutic concentrations for all tested DOACs and primarily in the INTEM 
      assay. Among the tested DOACs, apixaban demonstrated the least impact on CT 
      across all assays. In conclusion, ROTEM-derived CT measurements can serve as 
      surrogate markers for DOAC concentrations.

AB  - Orally active direct inhibitors of thrombin and factor Xa have now been approved 
      for treatment or prevention of deep vein thrombosis,and stroke associated with 
      atrial fibrillation. The factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, has shown promising 
      results in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome but is not yet approved for 
      that indication. These agents share a rapid onset and are cleared with half lives 
      of approximately 10 hours. At present there is no approved antidote for either 
      class of anticoagulant, making the treatment of life-threatening bleeding 
      episodes problematic. These agents have fewer drug interactions than warfarin, 
      have a predictable clearance, and hence do not require monitoring. Patients with 
      renal insufficiency have delayed clearance and hence may have elevated levels of 
      the drug leading to increased risk of bleeding.

      rivaroxaban in plasma sample.
PG  - 79-88

AB  - Rivaroxaban is a novel, selective and potent oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, 
      therapeutically indicated in the treatment of thromboembolic diseases. Like 
      traditional anticoagulants, routine coagulation monitoring of rivaroxaban is not 
      necessary, but important in some clinical circumstances. In this study, a 
      sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS assay for rapid determination of rivaroxaban in human 
      plasma was developed and validated. Rivaroxaban and its internal standard (IS) 
      were extracted from plasma using acetonitrile as protein precipitating agent. An 
      isocratic mobile phase of acetonitrile: 10 mM ammonium acetate (80:20, v/v) at a 
      flow rate of 0.3 mL/min was used for the separation of rivaroxaban and IS. Both 
      rivaroxaban and IS was eluted within 1 min with a total run time of 1.5 min only. 
      Electrospray ionization source in positive mode was used for the detections of 
      rivaroxaban and IS. Precursor to product ion transition of m/z 436.00 > 144.87 
      for rivaroxaban and m/z 411.18 > 191.07 for IS were used in multiple reaction 
      monitoring mode. Developed assay was fully validated in terms of selectivity, 
      linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery, matrix effects and stability using 
      official guideline on bioanalytical method.

TI  - Design of a liquid nano-sized drug delivery system with enhanced solubility of 
      rivaroxaban for venous thromboembolism management in paediatric patients and 
      emergency cases.
PG  - 399-412
LID - 10.1080/08982104.2019.1576732 [doi]
AB  - The increasing incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in paediatric population 
      has stimulated the development of liquid anticoagulant formulations. Thus our 
      goal is to formulate a liquid formulation of poorly-water soluble anticoagulant, 
      rivaroxaban (RIVA), for paediatric use and to assess the possibility of its 
      intravenous administration in emergencies. Self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery 
      systems (SNEDDSs) were developed and characterized. SNEDDS constituents were 
      estimated from the saturated solubility study followed by plotting the 
      corresponding ternary phase diagrams to determine the best self-emulsified 
      systems. Thermodynamic stability, emulsification, dispersibility, robustness to 
      dilution tests, in vitro dissolution, particle size, and zeta potential were 
      executed to optimize the formulations. The optimized formulation, that composed 
      of Capryol 90:Tween 20:PEG 300 (5:45:50), increased RIVA solubility (285.7-fold 
      than water), it formed nanoemulsion with a particle size of 16.15 nm, PDI of 0.25 
      and zeta potential of -21.8. It released 100.83 ± 2.78% of RIVA after 5 min. 
      SNEDDS was robust to dilution with oral and parenteral fluids and showed safety 
      to human RBCs. SNEDDS showed enhanced bioavailability after oral and intravenous 
      administration than the oral drug suspension (by 1.25 and 1.26-fold, 
      respectively). Moreover, it exhibited enhanced anticoagulant efficacy in the 
      prevention and treatment of carrageenan-induced thrombosis rat model.

TI  - Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling-Guided Dose Management of Oral 
      Anticoagulants when Initiating Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid) for COVID-19 
      Treatment.
PG  - 803-807

AB  - Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with cardiovascular diseases 
      who are at higher risk of progressing to critical illness should be treated with 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid). Ritonavir, the booster in 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, modulates multiple drug metabolizing enzymes and 
      transporters, complicating its use in real-world clinics. We aimed to apply 
      physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to simulate the complex 
      drug-drug interactions (DDIs) of ritonavir with two anticoagulants, rivaroxaban 
      and racemic warfarin, to address this important clinical conundrum. Simulations 
      were implemented within Simcyp Simulator. Compound and population models were 
      adopted from Simcyp and our previous studies. Upon verification and validation of 
      the PBPK model of ritonavir, prospective DDI simulations with the anticoagulants 
      were performed in both the general population (20-65 years) and geriatric 
      subjects (65-85 years) with or without moderate renal impairment. Elevated 
      rivaroxaban concentrations were simulated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment, 
      where the impact was more profound among geriatric subjects with renal 
      impairment. The overexposure of rivaroxaban was restored to normal range on day 4 
      post-discontinuation of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, corroborating with the recovery 
      of enzyme activity. A lower 10 mg daily dose of rivaroxaban could effectively 
      maintain acceptable systemic exposure of rivaroxaban during 
      nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment. Treatment of ritonavir marginally declined 
      simulated S-warfarin concentrations, but substantially elevated that of 
      R-warfarin, resulting in a decrease in the international normalized ratio (INR). 
      As INR only recovered 2 weeks post-nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment, a longer 
      surveillance INR for warfarin becomes important. Our PBPK-guided simulations 
      evaluated clinically important yet untested DDIs and supports clinical studies to 
      ensure proper anticoagulation management of patients with COVID-19 with chronic 
      coagulative abnormalities when initiating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir therapy.

AB  - Novel oral anticoagulants (OACs), including dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, 
      and apixaban, are available alternative anticoagulant therapy to vitamin K 
      antagonists. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, and apixaban for the treatment of appropriate patients for specific 
      clinical indications. Therapeutic advantages of prescribing the new OACs are 
      related to their predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. 
      Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban have all been shown to be noninferior to 
      warfarin treatment for stroke prevention in respective phase 3 clinical trials; 
      dabigatran and apixaban were shown to be superior to warfarin as preventive 
      therapy. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are all approved agents for stroke 
      prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in the United States 
      and Europe. Among these agents, rivaroxaban is the only FDA-approved drug for the 
      treatment of venous thromboembolism. This article reviews the major clinical 
      trials that investigated the efficacy and safety of the new OACs and the use of 
      these agents in special clinical situations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The anticoagulant actions of oral direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors 
      can be inferred from their observed plasma concentrations; however, the 
      steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of different FXa inhibitors have not been 
      compared in clinically. METHODS: The sensitivity of the rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      and edoxaban in the STA-Liquid Anti-FXa assay were compared, and the anti-FXa 
      plasma concentrations were measured for PK assessments. Nonlinear mixed-effects 
      modeling was used to assess population PK in 329 patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation or venous thromboembolism. Patients were followed up for an average 
      of 3.6 years. RESULTS: Sensitivity was similar among the three drugs in this 
      assay, which could directly compare plasma concentrations instead of anti-FXa 
      activities. Overall exposure was greatest in 5 mg BID apixaban relative to other 
      drugs (p < 0.001). The geometric mean AUC for the 0 to 24-h interval was 
      4550 ng h/mL for apixaban, 2710 ng h/mL for 15 mg QD rivaroxaban, and 
      1290 ng h/mL for 60 mg QD edoxaban. The PKs of 2.5 mg BID apixaban or 15 mg QD 
      rivaroxaban were associated with hemorrhagic events. CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban was 
      associated with greater exposure, higher trough concentrations in plasma compared 
      with rivaroxaban or edoxaban. Furthermore, a higher plasma concentration may 
      partially predict hemorrhagic events.

AB  - The marketing of new anticoagulant drugs has led us to review the development of 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban (oral anti-Xa drugs) and dabigatran (an oral thrombin 
      inhibitor). The results are different in terms of efficacy and tolerance. Each 
      molecule has its own field of application but it is not at all certain that each 
      will find its place. Though the results are favourable for these orally active 
      drugs in the orthopaedic setting, it is clear that only cardiological 
      applications will give a final green light for these products. The future will be 
      fascinating in this regard.

LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1363462 [doi]
AB  - Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) 
      inhibiting thrombin or factor Xa and effectively preventing thromboembolic 
      complications using fixed doses without need for laboratory-guided dose 
      adjustment. Plasma samples are needed to determine the actual concentration or 
      activity of DOACs, which may be required for special patient populations such as 
      those with acute deterioration of renal function due to any disease, before 
      surgical interventions, during bleeding or thrombotic episodes while on therapy 
      with DOACs, the elderly and youngest populations, unexpected pregnancy, suspicion 
      of overdose and toxication, and to control adherence to therapy. Serum samples 
      have several advantages over plasma samples such as no need of sampling with a 
      specific coagulation tube, reduced pre-analytical errors, and longer storage 
      stability. Determination of rivaroxaban and apixaban from serum samples of 
      patients on treatment performed well and better than samples of patients treated 
      with dabigatran compared with plasma samples. Specific adaption to automated 
      coagulation platforms may improve the performance of the assays from serum 
      samples.

TI  - Co-administration of rivaroxaban with drugs that share its elimination pathways: 
      pharmacokinetic effects in healthy subjects.
PG  - 455-66
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12075 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The anticoagulant rivaroxaban is an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor for 
      the management of thromboembolic disorders. Metabolism and excretion involve 
      cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and 2J2 (CYP2J2), CYP-independent mechanisms, and 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) (ABCG2). 
      METHODS: The pharmacokinetic effects of substrates or inhibitors of CYP3A4, P-gp 
      and Bcrp (ABCG2) on rivaroxaban were studied in healthy volunteers. RESULTS: 
      Rivaroxaban did not interact with midazolam (CYP3A4 probe substrate). Exposure to 
      rivaroxaban when co-administered with midazolam was slightly decreased by 11% 
      (95% confidence interval [CI] -28%, 7%) compared with rivaroxaban alone. The 
      following drugs moderately affected rivaroxaban exposure, but not to a clinically 
      relevant extent: erythromycin (moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor; 34% increase [95% 
      CI 23%, 46%]), clarithromycin (strong CYP3A4/moderate P-gp inhibitor; 54% 
      increase [95% CI 44%, 64%]) and fluconazole (moderate CYP3A4, possible Bcrp 
      [ABCG2] inhibitor; 42% increase [95% CI 29%, 56%]). A significant increase in 
      rivaroxaban exposure was demonstrated with the strong CYP3A4, P-gp/Bcrp (ABCG2) 
      inhibitors (and potential CYP2J2 inhibitors) ketoconazole (158% increase [95% CI 
      136%, 182%] for a 400 mg once daily dose) and ritonavir (153% increase [95% CI 
      134%, 174%]). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that rivaroxaban may be 
      co-administered with CYP3A4 and/or P-gp substrates/moderate inhibitors, but not 
      with strong combined CYP3A4, P-gp and Bcrp (ABCG2) inhibitors (mainly comprising 
      azole-antimycotics, apart from fluconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors), which 
      are multi-pathway inhibitors of rivaroxaban clearance and elimination.

PG  - 613-20
LID - 10.1177/1076029609342094 [doi]
AB  - Two selective, orally available anticoagulant agents, although with different 
      targets in the coagulation cascade, have recently been approved in many countries 
      on the indication of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism (VTE) after major 
      joint arthroplasty. This review discusses mainly the antifactor Xa drug, 
      rivaroxaban, with a focus on the orthopedic trials. Pharmacokinetic 
      characteristics and other clinical development programs with rivaroxaban are 
      briefly reviewed. Although the aim of this article is not to review the direct 
      thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran etexilate, some comparisons are made. For clinical 
      results, these are obviously indirect and conclusions must be drawn with caution 
      until head-to-head comparisons are performed. Whether the introduction of 
      rivaroxaban is a change of paradigm will ultimately be decided in the eyes and 
      mind of the beholder.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are not recommended in COVID-19 patients 
      receiving dexamethasone because of potential drug-drug and drug-disease 
      interactions affecting anticoagulant concentration and activity. To evaluate 
      short- and long-term pharmacokinetic interactions, serial through and peak DOAC 
      plasma levels were prospectively measured during and after dexamethasone therapy, 
      as well as during the acute phase and after recovery from COVID-19 in 
      hospitalized, non-critically ill patients undergoing treatment with DOACs. 
      Thirty-three (18 males, mean age 79 years) consecutive patients received DOACs 
      (17 apixaban, 12 rivaroxaban, 4 edoxaban) for atrial fibrillation (n = 22), 
      venous thromboembolism (n = 10), and acute myocardial infarction (n = 1). 
      Twenty-six patients also received dexamethasone at a dose of 6 mg once daily for 
      a median of 14 days. Trough DOAC levels on dexamethasone were within and below 
      expected reference ranges respectively in 87.5 and 8.3% of patients, with no 
      statistically significant differences at 48-72 h and 14-21 days after 
      dexamethasone discontinuation. Peak DOAC levels on dexamethasone were within 
      expected reference ranges in 58.3% of patients, and below ranges in 33.3%, of 
      whom over two thirds had low values also off dexamethasone. No significant 
      differences in DOAC levels were found during hospitalization and after resolution 
      of COVID-19. Overall, 28 patients were discharged alive, and none experienced 
      thrombotic or bleeding events. In this study, dexamethasone administration or 
      acute COVID-19 seemed not to affect DOAC levels in hospitalized, non-critically 
      ill COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Enhanced Biopharmaceutical Performance of Rivaroxaban through Polymeric Amorphous 
      Solid Dispersion.
PG  - 652-668
LID - 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01027 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban (RXB) is an orally active direct inhibitor of the activated serine 
      protease Factor Xa, given as monotherapy in the treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE). It has been characterized in vitro as a substrate for the 
      active, nonsaturable efflux via P-gp transporter, limiting its high permeability. 
      Therefore, the role of P-gp inhibiting polymers in enhancing the 
      biopharmaceutical performance of RXB by preparing polymeric amorphous solid 
      dispersion and subsequent improvement in solubility and permeability was 
      investigated. Initially, solubility parameter and Flory-Huggins interaction 
      parameter were determined for miscibility studies between drug and polymers. 
      Binary dispersions were prepared by dissolving drug with polymers eudragit S100, 
      eudragit L100, and soluplus in common solvent (5% v/v water in tetrahydrofuran) 
      using spray dryer. Prepared binary dispersions were analyzed by differential 
      scanning calorimetry (DSC), microscopy, powder X-ray diffractometry (PXRD), 
      Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic vapor sorption (DVS), and 
      solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Superior performance of 
      binary dispersions was observed upon dissolution and solubility studies over 
      micronized active pharmaceutical ingredient. Amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) 
      prepared with soluplus showed 10-fold increase in apparent solubility and 
      maintenance of supersaturation for 24 h compared to the crystalline RXB. Further, 
      pharmacokinetic study performed in animals was in good correlation with the 
      solubility data. Increases of 5.7- and 6.7-fold were observed in AUC and C(max), 
      respectively, for ASDs prepared with soluplus compared to those with crystalline 
      RXB. FTIR and NMR spectroscopy unveiled the involvement of N-H group of RXB with 
      C═O group of polymers in intermolecular interactions. The decreased drug efflux 
      ratio was observed for ASDs prepared with eudragit S100 and soluplus in Caco-2 
      transport study suggesting improvement in the absorption of RXB. Hence, the 
      present study demonstrates ASD using soluplus as a promising formulation strategy 
      for enhancing the biopharmaceutical performance of RXB by increasing the 
      solubility and circumventing the P-gp activity.

TI  - Direct Oral Anticoagulants: An Updated Systematic Review of Their Clinical 
      Pharmacology and Clinical Effectiveness and Safety in Patients With Nonvalvular 
      Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 383-396
LID - 10.1002/jcph.2184 [doi]
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants have been an increasingly used class of drugs in the 
      setting of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, defying vitamin K antagonists' 
      monopoly when it comes to anticoagulation due to its several limitations. Direct 
      oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have entered the market as a noninferior and safer 
      option in comparison with vitamin K antagonists, as their respective phase III 
      clinical trials proved. The aim of this article was to update and summarize data 
      on their clinical pharmacology and to review real-world data to know their 
      comparative effectiveness and safety. We performed a systematic review using 
      PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Web of Science as search engines. Regarding 
      pharmacodynamics, there were no substantial changes reported from their original 
      profile. There were many advances in the knowledge about clinical 
      pharmacokinetics of DOACs that have had a direct impact on their clinical use, 
      mainly related to drug-drug interactions. In a real-world setting, DOACs have 
      shown to be noninferior in preventing thromboembolic events compared to vitamin K 
      antagonists. In regards to safety, DOACs have shown a lower bleeding risk 
      relative to warfarin. Comparison between DOACs has demonstrated rivaroxaban to 
      have the highest bleeding risk. Overall, the evidence gathered showed few changes 
      from the original data presented in phase III clinical trials, concluding that 
      their real-world use coincides greatly with them.

TI  - Preparation and optimisation of solid lipid nanoparticles of rivaroxaban using 
      artificial neural networks and response surface method.

LID - 10.1080/02652048.2024.2437362 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to improve rivaroxaban delivery by optimising solid lipid 
      nanoparticles (SLN) for minimal mean diameter and maximal entrapment efficiency 
      (EE), enhancing solubility, bioavailability, and the ability to cross the 
      blood-brain barrier. METHODS: A central composite design was employed to 
      synthesise 32 SLN formulations. Response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial 
      neural networks (ANN) models predicted mean diameter and EE based on five 
      independent variables. RESULTS: The optimised SLN formulation achieved a mean 
      particle diameter of 159.8 ± 15.2 nm, with a Polydispersity index of 0.46, a zeta 
      potential of -28.8 mV, and an EE of 74.3% ± 5.6%. The ANN model showed superior 
      accuracy for both mean diameter and EE, outperforming the RSM model. Structural 
      integrity and stability were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 
      differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier-transform infrared 
      spectroscopy (FTIR). CONCLUSION: The high accuracy of the ANN model highlights 
      its potential in optimising pharmaceutical formulations and improving SLN-based 
      drug delivery systems.

TI  - Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling for the Prediction of a Drug-Drug 
      Interaction of Combined Effects on P-glycoprotein and Cytochrome P450 3A.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants, such as apixaban and rivaroxaban, are important for 
      the treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism and to reduce the risk of 
      stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. 
      Because apixaban and rivaroxaban are predominantly eliminated by cytochrome P450 
      (CYP) 3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), concomitant use of combined P-gp and strong 
      CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers should be avoided. Physiologically-based 
      pharmacokinetic models for apixaban and rivaroxaban were developed to estimate 
      the net effect of CYP3A induction, P-gp inhibition, and P-gp induction by 
      rifampicin. The disposition of rivaroxaban is more complex compared with apixaban 
      because both hepatic and renal P-gp is considered to contribute to rivaroxaban 
      elimination. Furthermore, organic anion transporter-3, a renal uptake 
      transporter, may also contribute the elimination of rivaroxaban from systemic 
      circulation. The models were verified with observed clinical drug-drug 
      interactions with CYP3A and P-gp inhibitors. With the developed models, the 
      predicted area under the concentration time curve and maximum concentration 
      ratios were 0.43 and 0.48, respectively, for apixaban, and 0.50-0.52 and 
      0.72-0.73, respectively, for rivaroxaban when coadministered with 600 mg multiple 
      doses of rifampicin and that were very close to observed data. The impact of each 
      of the elimination pathways was assessed for rivaroxaban, and inhibition of CYP3A 
      led to a larger impact over intestinal and hepatic P-gp. Inhibition of renal 
      organic anion transporter-3 or P-gp led to an overall modest interaction. The 
      developed apixaban and rivaroxaban models can be further applied to the 
      investigation of interactions with other P-gp and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors and 
      inducers.

TI  - Binding of direct oral anticoagulants to the FA1 site of human serum albumin.
PG  - e2877
LID - 10.1002/jmr.2877 [doi]
AB  - The anticoagulant therapy is widely used to prevent and treat thromboembolic 
      events. Until the last decade, vitamin K antagonists were the only available oral 
      anticoagulants; recently, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed. 
      Since 55% to 95% of DOACs are bound to plasma proteins, the in silico docking and 
      ligand-binding properties of drugs apixaban, betrixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, 
      and rivaroxaban and of the prodrug dabigatran etexilate to human serum albumin 
      (HSA), the most abundant plasma protein, have been investigated. DOACs bind to 
      the fatty acid (FA) site 1 (FA1) of ligand-free HSA, whereas they bind to the FA8 
      and FA9 sites of heme-Fe(III)- and myristic acid-bound HSA. DOACs binding to the 
      FA1 site of ligand-free HSA has been validated by competitive inhibition of 
      heme-Fe(III) recognition. Values of the dissociation equilibrium constant for 
      DOACs binding to the FA1 site (ie, (calc) K(DOAC) ) derived from in silico 
      docking simulations (ranging between 1.2 × 10(-8) M and 1.4 × 10(-6) M) agree 
      with those determined experimentally from competitive inhibition of heme-Fe(III) 
      binding (ie, (exp) K(DOAC) ; ranging between 2.5 × 10(-7) M and 2.2 × 10(-6) M). 
      In addition, this study highlights the inequivalence of rivaroxaban binding to 
      mammalian serum albumin. Given the HSA concentration in vivo (~7.5 × 10(-4) M), 
      values of K(DOAC) here determined indicate that the formation of the HSA:DOACs 
      complexes in the absence and presence of FAs and heme-Fe(III) may occur in vivo. 
      Therefore, HSA appears to be an important determinant for DOACs transport.

TI  - Supratheraputic rivaroxaban levels: A persistent drug-drug interaction after 
      discontinuation of amiodarone.
PG  - 351-353
LID - 10.1111/bcpt.13419 [doi]
AB  - We report the case of an 88-year old woman referred for evaluation of increased 
      INR. Surprisingly supratherapeutic levels of rivaroxaban was detected. Upon 
      scrutiny of the patient's medical history, a drug-drug interaction between 
      amiodarone and rivaroxaban persisting 3 weeks after cessation of amiodaron 
      remains the prime suspect causing the clinical picture. Both INR and rivaroxaban 
      levels returned to normal within 3 days of cessation of rivaroxaban. The case 
      highlights that rivaroxaban, although highly variably, does affect INR. 
      Furthermore, it highlights that the potential for DDIs involving amiodarone may 
      persists for weeks or months after discontinuation. Amiodarone is predicted to 
      increase rivaroxaban exposure, through inhibition of rivaroxaban elimination via 
      CYP3A4 and P-gp. Elderly patients and patients with declining renal function are 
      especially at risk of increased rivaroxaban exposure when a DDI with amiodarone 
      occurs.

TI  - Italian intersociety consensus on DOAC use in internal medicine.
PG  - 387-406
LID - 10.1007/s11739-017-1628-6 [doi]
AB  - The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are drugs used in clinical practice since 
      2009 for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation, and for the treatment and secondary prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism. The four DOACs, including the three factor Xa inhibitors 
      (rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) and one direct thrombin inhibitor 
      (dabigatran) provide oral anticoagulation therapy alternatives to Vitamin K 
      antagonists (VKAs). Despite their clear advantages, the DOACs require on the part 
      of the internist a thorough knowledge of their pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic characteristics to ensure their correct use, laboratory 
      monitoring and the appropriate management of adverse events. This document 
      represents a consensus paper on the use of DOACs by representatives of three 
      Italian scientific societies: the Italian Society of Internal Medicine (SIMI), 
      the Federation of the Associations of Hospital Managers (FADOI), and the Society 
      for the Study of Haemostasis and Thrombosis (SISET). This document formulates 
      expert opinion guidance for pragmatic managing, monitoring and reversing the 
      anticoagulant effect of DOACs in both chronic and emergency settings. This 
      practical guidance may help the internist to create adequate protocols for 
      patients hospitalized ion internal medicine wards, where patients are often 
      elderly subjects affected by poly-morbidities and renal insufficiency, and, thus, 
      require particular attention to drug-drug interactions and peri-procedural 
      protocols.

AB  - Nonvitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulant agents (NOACs) are currently 
      recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke. As a group, 
      NOACs significantly reduce stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality, with 
      lower to similar major bleeding rates compared with warfarin. All NOACs are 
      dependent on the kidney for elimination, such that patients with creatinine 
      clearance <25 ml/min were excluded from all the pivotal phase 3 NOAC trials. It 
      therefore remains unclear how or if NOACs should be prescribed to patients with 
      advanced chronic kidney disease and those on dialysis. The authors review the 
      current pharmacokinetic, observational, and prospective data on NOACs in patients 
      with advanced chronic kidney disease (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) and those 
      on dialysis. The authors frame the evidence in terms of risk versus benefit to 
      bring greater clarity to NOAC-related major bleeding and efficacy at preventing 
      stroke specifically in patients with creatinine clearance <30 ml/min.

AB  - The traditional agents used for thromboprophylaxis are effective and safe but 
      have limitations particularly related to ease of administration. Newer agents 
      targeting single coagulation factors such as the direct thrombin inhibitor 
      dabigatran and the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban have 
      demonstrated efficacy and safety for thromboembolism prophylaxis in the 
      orthopedic population and have the additional benefit of oral administration and 
      predictable pharmacokinetics. Pharmacology of the new anticoagulants and 
      published data on the use of these agents in total knee and hip replacement 
      patients will be reviewed in this article.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the convenience afforded by the lack of required laboratory 
      monitoring, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used as 
      alternatives to Vitamin-K antagonists for certain medical conditions. However, 
      there are circumstances in which assessment of DOAC plasma concentrations may be 
      helpful in guiding clinical decisions, including patients presenting with either 
      bleeding or thrombosis, or patients requiring urgent invasive procedures. 
      Evaluating the anticoagulant effects of DOACs is often difficult because of the 
      limited availability of DOAC-specific assays in most laboratories. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the correlation between ex vivo plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban and 
      a chromogenic anti-Xa assay for low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) routinely 
      used in our coagulation laboratory. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine blood 
      samples from 20 patients anticoagulated with rivaroxaban (dose; 10-20 mg/day) 
      were evaluated using an anti-Xa assay for LMWH and results were correlated with 
      rivaroxaban plasma concentrations using a rivaroxaban specific assay. RESULTS: A 
      linear dose-dependent relationship was demonstrated between plasma concentrations 
      of rivaroxaban and the chromogenic anti-Xa assay for LMWH (R2 = 0.92). PT and PTT 
      demonstrated poor correlations (R2 = 0.03; and R2 = 0.01, respectively) with 
      rivaroxaban plasma concentrations. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study suggest 
      that if specific assays for rivaroxaban are unavailable, then the chromogenic 
      anti-Xa assay for LMWH may be useful for assessing the anticoagulant effects of 
      rivaroxaban.

TI  - Rivaroxaban Concentration in Breast Milk During Breastfeeding: A Case Study.
PG  - 748-751
LID - 10.1089/bfm.2019.0230 [doi]
AB  - Background: Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors, collectively referred to as direct 
      oral anticoagulants, are not recommended for breastfeeding women due to 
      insufficient data about the transfer of these drugs into breast milk. In this 
      study, we serially measured rivaroxaban concentrations in the breast milk of one 
      nursing mother who was at high risk of deep vein thrombosis and evaluated the 
      health of her breastfed infant. Materials and Methods: Breast milk rivaroxaban 
      concentrations were measured 3 months after delivery by a validated liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Breast milk samples were 
      collected sequentially after 15 mg of oral rivaroxaban administration after 
      ethical approval and informed consent. Case report: A 38-year-old female 
      diagnosed with the antiphospholipid syndrome had received rivaroxaban after 
      delivery. The infant was partially breastfed until the age of 18 months. The mean 
      minimum and maximum rivaroxaban concentrations in breast milk were 9.73 ng/mL 
      before each dose and 53.9 ng/mL at 6 hours after each dose, respectively. The 
      mean daily infant dose was 0.0034 mg/kg and the mean relative infant dose (RID) 
      via breast milk was 1.79%. Discussion and Conclusion: The RIDs of rivaroxaban did 
      not exceed 10% of the maternal dose, suggesting that exposure of rivaroxaban via 
      breastfed is seldom clinically relevant for the infant. A pediatric assessment of 
      the infant found no detectable drug-related adverse effects. Further studies are 
      needed to elucidate how breastfeeding infants are impacted by exposure to 
      rivaroxaban.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are mostly prescribed to prevent cardioembolic 
      stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). An increasing 
      number of guidelines recommend DOAC in AF patients with preserved renal function 
      for the prevention of thromboembolism, and an increased use of DOAC in daily 
      practice has been recorded also in elderly patients. Ageing is associated with a 
      reduction in glomerular filtration rate, and impaired renal function, regardless 
      of the cause, increases the risk of bleeding. Multiple medication use 
      (polypharmacy) for treating superimposed co-morbidities is common in both elderly 
      and chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and drug-drug interaction may cause 
      accumulation of DOAC, thereby increasing the risk of bleeding. The safety profile 
      of DOAC in patients with CKD has not been defined with any certainty, 
      particularly in those with severely impaired renal function or end stage renal 
      disease. This has been due to the heterogeneity of studies and the relative 
      paucity of data. This document reports the position of three Italian scientific 
      societies engaged in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation who are 
      treated with DOAC and present with CKD.

AB  - The Multimorbid Patient: Use of New Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Chronic 
      Kidney Disease Abstract. Increasing life expectancy in Western countries is 
      associated with a high prevalence of multiple chronic diseases which is defined 
      by the term "multimorbidity". Many of these patients suffer from chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and thrombogenic comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation with the 
      need for oral anticoagulation. For decades vitamin K antagonists have been 
      exclusively prescribed for oral anticoagulation. However, due to altered 
      pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of these drugs in CKD, a significant risk of 
      bleeding exists. The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants as a new and 
      promising alternative to vitamin K antagonists was -especially for CKD patients - 
      highly anticipated. However, data from randomized studies are missing for older 
      patients with advanced CKD. Consequently, a careful evaluation of the 
      risk-benefit ratio is recommended for this sensitive patient population.

TI  - Sensitive LC-MS/MS method for quantification of rivaroxaban in plasma: 
      Application to pharmacokinetic studies.
PG  - e5147
LID - 10.1002/bmc.5147 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant (orally active direct Xa inhibitor) considered to 
      reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism and treat deep vein thrombosis, 
      pulmonary embolism, and other cardiovascular complications. Bioanalytical methods 
      for rivaroxaban quantification in plasma are necessary for application in 
      pharmacokinetic studies, as well as in drug therapeutic monitoring. In this work, 
      we developed and validated a sensitive bioanalytical method using LC-MS/MS for 
      rivaroxaban quantification in human plasma using an one-step liquid-liquid 
      extraction. The linear concentration range was 1-600 ng/mL. The bioanalytical 
      method was also applied to pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers under 
      fasting and fed conditions. The results demonstrated that the method is rapid, 
      sensitive, and adequate for application in pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - Pharmacologic properties of the new oral anticoagulants: a clinician-oriented 
      review with a focus on perioperative management.
PG  - 3436-41
AB  - The past decade has witnessed an explosion in the clinical development of new 
      orally-administered anticoagulant drugs aimed at complementing vitamin K 
      antagonists and heparins for the prevention and treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism, for the prevention of stroke in patients with chronic atrial 
      fibrillation, and for treatment of acute coronary syndromes. This review will 
      focus on those new oral anticoagulants that are most relevant to the practicing 
      clinician. These drugs consist of dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor and 
      rivaroxaban, a factor Xa inhibitor, both of which have been recently approved for 
      clinical use. In addition, apixaban will be reviewed, which is another factor Xa 
      inhibitor that is in the final stages of clinical development. The objectives of 
      this review are: 1) to provide a clinician-oriented overview of the key 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of dabigatran, rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban; 2) to consider the implications of these drugs' pharmacologic 
      properties in the perioperative setting for patients who require elective or 
      urgent surgery, focusing on pre- and post-operative dosing, laboratory monitoring 
      and reversal of anticoagulant effect.

TI  - Bleeding Events Associated with Rivaroxaban Therapy in Naive Patients with 
      Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation: A Longitudinal Study from a Genetic Perspective 
      with INR Follow-Up.
LID - 10.3390/medicina60101712 [doi]
LID - 1712
AB  - Background and Objectives: Rivaroxaban is a direct-acting anticoagulant used to 
      prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Rivaroxaban is a substrate 
      for P-glycoprotein, which is encoded by the ABCB1 gene. Rivaroxaban is also 
      metabolized by the CYP3A5 gene. Therefore, the current study is carried out to 
      study the effects of polymorphisms in the ABCB1 and CYP3A5 genes, which may 
      affect the plasma levels of rivaroxaban, with subsequent clinical outcomes 
      (bleeding events) associated with the therapy. Materials and Methods: The study 
      was conducted on 66 naive patients with atrial fibrillation treated with 
      rivaroxaban. Blood samples of rivaroxaban were taken at 3 h and after 1 month 
      following the administration of the drug to measure plasma levels. The blood 
      level of rivaroxaban was measured with an HPLC-UV detector. Sanger sequencing was 
      used to find polymorphisms in the targeted genes. Coagulation parameters were 
      measured at 3 h and after 1 month of administration of rivaroxaban. Frequencies 
      of bleeding events were recorded throughout the one-month course of drug therapy. 
      Results: The heterozygous and homozygous mutant genotypes of ABCB1 (rs2032582, 
      rs1045642, rs1128503, and rs4148738) and CYP3A5 (rs776746) showed lower plasma 
      concentrations as compared to the wild-type genotype. ABCB1 (rs2032582, 
      rs1045642, rs1128503, and rs4148738) and CYP3A5 (rs776746) gene polymorphisms had 
      a statistically significant impact on the plasma concentration of rivaroxaban 
      among the heterozygous and homozygous mutant genotypes compared to the wild-type 
      genotype. The heterozygous variant of ABCB1 and homozygous variant of CYP3A5 
      suffered more events of bleeding. Conclusions: It was concluded that ABCB1 
      (rs2032582, rs1045642, rs1128503, and rs4148738) and CYP3A5 (rs776746) gene 
      polymorphisms had a significant impact on the plasma levels of rivaroxaban in 
      patients treated for atrial fibrillation on day three as well as after one month 
      of the therapy. The lowest plasma levels were observed in patients with a 
      homozygous variant of ABCB1 (rs2032582, rs1045642, or rs4148738) along with the 
      CYP3A5*1/*3 allele. The heterozygous variant of ABCB1 SNPs and homozygous variant 
      of CYP3A5 SNPs suffered more events of bleeding.

TI  - Rivaroxaban: a once-daily anticoagulant for the prevention of thromboembolic 
      complications.

AB  - The majority of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) will require 
      anticoagulation therapy for reducing the risk of stroke, the most devastating 
      complication of AF. Although traditionally vitamin K antagonists have been used 
      for this purpose, they have important limitations that interfere with their use 
      in clinical practice. Different clinical trials have shown the benefits of new 
      oral anticoagulants over warfarin, but patients included in the ROCKET-AF trial 
      were found to be at a higher risk of AF-related complications. Moreover, 
      rivaroxaban has been proven to be effective and safe in patients with AF and 
      moderate renal dysfunction as well as in those with ischemic heart disease. 
      Rivaroxaban is taken only once daily; this may improve medication adherence and, 
      secondarily, it provides a higher protection and reduction in the risk of stroke. 
      This article provides an extensive review of the available evidence about 
      rivaroxaban, with a special focus on nonvalvular AF.

TI  - Novel rivaroxaban-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/poloxamer nanoparticles: 
      preparation, physicochemical characterization, in vitro evaluation of 
      time-dependent anticoagulant activity and toxicological profile.
PG  - 135101

AB  - Rivaroxaban (RXB), an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, presents innovative 
      therapeutic profile. However, RXB has shown adverse effects, mainly due to 
      pharmacokinetic limitations, highlighting the importance of developing more 
      effective formulations. Therefore, this work aims at the preparation, 
      physicochemical characterization and in vitro evaluation of time-dependent 
      anticoagulant activity and toxicology profile of RXB-loaded 
      poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/poloxamer nanoparticles (RXBNps). RXBNp were 
      produced by nanoprecipitation method and physicochemical characteristics were 
      evaluated. In vitro analysis of time-dependent anticoagulant activity was 
      performed by prothrombin time test and toxicological profile was assessed by 
      hemolysis and MTT reduction assays. The developed RXBNp present spherical 
      morphology with average diameter of 205.5 ± 16.95 nm (PdI 0.096 ± 0.04), negative 
      zeta potential (-26.28 ± 0.77 mV), entrapment efficiency of 91.35 ± 2.40%, yield 
      of 41.81 ± 1.68% and 3.72 ± 0.07% of drug loading. Drug release was characterized 
      by an initial fast release followed by a sustained release with 28.34 ± 2.82% of 
      RXB available in 72 h. RXBNp showed an expressive time-dependent anticoagulant 
      activity in human and rat blood plasma and non-toxic profile. Based on the 
      results presented, it is possible to consider that RXBNp may be able to assist in 
      the development of promising new therapies for treatment of thrombotic disorders.

PG  - 18-23
LID - 10.1007/s15006-017-9295-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent findings require an update of earlier recommendations on the 
      perioperative management of non Vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC). 
      METHOD: The present position paper summarises the outcomes of an expert panel 
      discussion. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of 
      rivaroxaban, a preoperative interruption of 24-72 hours is recommended depending 
      on the patient's renal function, as well as individual and surgery-related 
      bleeding risks. Similar NOAC-free intervals are recommended for patients with 
      epidural catheters. Elective surgery should be delayed accordingly. A low 
      molecular weight heparin (LMWH) "bridging" (in fact "switching") should be 
      avoided because of an increased bleeding risk. Six to 8 hours after the 
      intervention rivaroxaban can be re-initiated or, in case of more extensive 
      interventions or an increased bleeding risk, after 24-72 hours; if necessary this 
      interval could by bridged with LMWH, e. g. if the thromboembolic risk is 
      considered high. In case of emergency surgery with a rivaroxaban pause of less 
      than 9 hours, one should be prepared for a bleeding management including the use 
      of prothrombin concentrate (PCC). Coagulation tests have no value for predicting 
      perioperative bleeding, in contrast to a standardised bleeding history. As an 
      overall estimate, the PT (Quick) can be determined with a suitable reagent. 
      Currently, rivaroxaban-specific measurements of anti Xa levels are available at 
      few specialised centres only. Moderate to severe haemorrhages can usually be 
      managed by temporary interruption of rivaroxaban in conjunction with local and 
      general haemostatic measures. Life-threatening bleeding events require a specific 
      haemostasis management including the administration of PCC; these events are rare 
      and usually have a favourable prognosis, except for intracranial haemorrhages.

TI  - Body weight has limited influence on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, 
      or pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) in healthy subjects.
PG  - 218-26
AB  - Anticoagulants are often dose adjusted, or their use restricted, in patients with 
      extremes of body weight. Rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) is a novel, oral, direct 
      factor Xa inhibitor in clinical development. This was a randomized, single-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in healthy male and female subjects to 
      assess the effect of extreme body weight (< or = 50 kg and >120 kg), and gender, 
      on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of 
      rivaroxaban 10 mg, compared with subjects of normal weight (70-80 kg). 
      Rivaroxaban was well tolerated. Cmax of rivaroxaban was unaffected in subjects 
      >120 kg but was increased by 24% in subjects weighing < or = 50 kg, resulting in 
      a small (15%) increase in prolongation of prothrombin time, which was not 
      considered clinically relevant. The area under the curve was unaffected by body 
      weight or gender. No other clinically relevant differences were observed, 
      suggesting that rivaroxaban is unlikely to require dose adjustment for body 
      weight or gender.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most common arrhythmia in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). As in the general population, in CKD patients AF is 
      associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism and stroke. However, CKD 
      patients, especially those on renal replacement therapy (RRT), also exhibit an 
      increased risk of bleeding, especially from the gastrointestinal tract. Oral 
      anticoagulation is the most effective form of thromboprophylaxis in patients with 
      AF presenting increased risk of stroke. Limited evidence on efficacy, the 
      increased risk of bleeding as well as some concern regarding the use of warfarin 
      in CKD, has often resulted in the underuse of anticoagulation CKD patients. A 
      large body of evidence suggests that non-vitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulant 
      agents (NOACs) significantly reduce the risk of stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, 
      and mortality, with lower to similar major bleeding rates compared with vitamin K 
      antagonist such as warfarin in normal renal function subjects. Hence, they are 
      currently recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke. 
      However, NOACs metabolism is largely dependent on the kidneys for elimination and 
      little is known in patients with creatinine clearance <25ml/min who were excluded 
      from all pivotal phase 3 NOACs trials. This review focuses on the current 
      pharmacokinetic, observational, and prospective data on NOACs in patients with 
      moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (creatinine clearance 15-49ml/min) 
      and those on dialysis.

TI  - Laboratory Assessment of the Anticoagulant Activity of Apixaban in Patients With 
      Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 194S-201S

AB  - Our aim is to determine the most appropriate laboratory tests, besides 
      anti-factor Xa (anti-FXa) chromogenic assays, to estimate the degree of 
      anticoagulation with apixaban and compare it with that of rivaroxaban in 
      real-world patients. Twenty patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation treated 
      with apixaban 5 mg twice daily and 20 patients on rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily 
      were studied. Conventional coagulation tests, thrombin generation assay (TGA), 
      and thromboelastometry (nonactivated TEM [NATEM] assay) were performed in the 40 
      patients and 20 controls. The anti-FXa chromogenic assays were used to measure 
      apixaban and rivaroxaban plasma levels. The NATEM measurements showed no 
      significant difference between the 2 groups of patients. Concerning TGA, 
      endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) was significantly decreased in patients on 
      rivaroxaban as compared to those treated with apixaban (P < .003). A 
      statistically significant, strong inverse correlation between apixaban plasma 
      concentrations and ETP (P < .001) was observed. Apixaban significantly reduces 
      ETP compared to controls, but to a lesser extent than rivaroxaban. Thrombin 
      generation assay might provide additional information on apixaban exposure, which 
      is required in order to individualize treatment especially for patients with a 
      high bleeding risk. Our findings have to be further investigated in studies with 
      larger sample sizes, in the entire range of apixaban exposure, with other direct 
      oral anticoagulants, and in relation to clinical outcomes.

TI  - Exposure Matching-Based Pediatric Dose Selection for Drugs with Renal Excretion - 
      Lessons Learned from Pediatric Development of Direct Oral Anticoagulants.
PG  - 1174-1187
LID - 10.1002/cpt.3396 [doi]
AB  - The pediatric clinical development programs of the direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran have recently been completed, with 
      apixaban close to the finish line. One common pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristic 
      of these four DOACs is that renal excretion contributes 27% or more in their 
      elimination, resulting in age-dependent drug clearance in both pediatric and 
      adult subjects. Several lessons have been learned from adult exposure matching 
      and pediatric dose selection for DOACs. The main goal of this tutorial is to 
      provide an informed perspective on pediatric dose selection for renally excreted 
      drugs, using these four DOACs as case examples. This tutorial is organized into 
      seven steps: (1) consideration of age-related differences in disease and response 
      to treatment; (2) consideration of age-related differences in drug absorption, 
      distribution, metabolism, and excretion; (3) selection of the reference adult 
      population and exposure for pediatric exposure matching; (4) prediction of 
      pediatric clearance and pediatric dose selection based on data from young adults; 
      (5) conduct and design of efficient pediatric PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies 
      that inform dose selection; (6) assessment of exposure matching and dose 
      adjustment using population PK simulation; (7) evaluation of the need for dose 
      adjustment in pediatric sub-populations.

TI  - Leveraging a Previously Published Population Pharmacokinetic Model to Predict 
      Rivaroxaban Exposure in Real-World Patients.
PG  - 1518-1527
LID - 10.1002/jcph.2122 [doi]
AB  - Population pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic models are commonly used to 
      inform drug dosing; however, often real-world patients are not well represented 
      in the clinical trial population. We sought to determine how well dosing 
      recommended in the rivaroxaban drug label results in exposure for real-world 
      patients within a reference area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) range. 
      To accomplish this, we assessed the utility of a prior published rivaroxaban 
      population PK model to predict exposure in real-world patients. We used the model 
      to predict rivaroxaban exposure for 230 real-world patients using 3 methods: (1) 
      using patient phenotype information only, (2) using individual post hoc estimates 
      of clearance from the prior model based on single PK samples of rivaroxaban 
      collected at steady state without refitting of the prior model, and (3) using 
      individual post hoc estimates of clearance from the prior model based on PK 
      samples of rivaroxaban collected at steady state after refitting of the prior 
      model. We compared the results across 3 software packages (NONMEM, Phoenix NLME, 
      and Monolix). We found that while the average patient-assigned dosing per the 
      drug label will likely result in the AUC falling within the reference range, AUC 
      for most individual patients will be outside the reference range. When comparing 
      post hoc estimates, the average pairwise percentage differences were all &lt;10% 
      when comparing the software packages, but individual pairwise estimates varied as 
      much as 50%. This study demonstrates the use of a prior published rivaroxaban 
      population PK model to predict exposure in real-world patients.

TI  - Concomitant Use of Diltiazem With Direct Oral Anticoagulants and Bleeding Risk in 
      Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - e025723
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.122.025723 [doi]
LID - e025723
AB  - Background Diltiazem, a moderate cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme/P-glycoprotein 
      inhibitor, may potentiate the bleeding risk of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      through pharmacokinetic interactions. We evaluated the association between 
      concomitant use of diltiazem with DOACs and bleeding among patients with atrial 
      fibrillation, across varying degrees of kidney function. Methods and Results We 
      identified 4544 patients with atrial fibrillation who were initiated on 
      rivaroxaban (n=1583), apixaban (n=2373), or dabigatran (n=588), between 2010 and 
      2019 in Geisinger Health, with a mean age of 72 years and an estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate of 70 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). At the time of DOAC initiation, 15% 
      patients were taking diltiazem and an additional 5% were initiated on diltiazem 
      during follow-up. Among DOAC users, using diltiazem concurrently (versus DOAC 
      alone) was associated with an increased risk of any bleeding-related 
      hospitalization (unadjusted risk difference, 2.4; 95% CI, 0.6-4.2 events per 100 
      person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.56, 95% CI, 1.15-2.12), as well as major 
      bleeding (unadjusted risk difference, 1.4 [95% CI, 0.1-2.6 events per 100 
      person-years]; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.18-2.85]). Increased risk 
      of any/major bleeding with diltiazem was observed in both patients with and 
      without CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) (P 
      for interaction=0.524 and 0.629, respectively). Among 13 179 warfarin users (the 
      negative control), concomitant diltiazem use was not associated with bleeding. 
      Conclusions Concomitant use of diltiazem with DOACs was associated with a higher 
      bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation, consistently in both 
      subgroups of chronic kidney disease and non-chronic kidney disease. For DOAC 
      users, concomitant diltiazem should be prescribed only when the benefit outweighs 
      the risk, with close monitoring for signs of bleeding.

LID - 10.5582/ddt.2016.01064 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is an oral direct Factor Xa inhibitor approved in the European Union 
      and the United Sates for the single-drug treatment of several thromboembolic 
      diseases in adults. Ιt has been evaluated in large phase III clinical trials and 
      has been found to have similar efficacy and safety with standard therapy. Herein, 
      is described a very rare case of a rivaroxaban-induced spontaneous expanding 
      chest wall hematoma, that required surgical intervention, in a breast cancer 
      patient. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a 
      probable relationship (score of 7) between the patient's development of hematoma 
      and treatment with rivaroxaban. Physicians should be cautious when prescribing 
      rivaroxaban in groups of patients associated with increased bleeding risk such as 
      patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, hypertension, coronary heart 
      disease, heart failure, patients with certain types of cancers and patients 
      receiving concomitant medications which may alter the pharmacokinetic or 
      pharmacodymamic parameters of rivaroxaban. Anticoagulant treatment should be 
      tailored to each individual patient weighing the bleeding risk against the risk 
      of recurrent thrombosis.

TI  - Microdosed Cocktail of Three Oral Factor Xa Inhibitors to Evaluate Drug-Drug 
      Interactions with Potential Perpetrator Drugs.
PG  - 1155-1163
LID - 10.1007/s40262-019-00749-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to prove the suitability of simultaneously 
      administered microdoses of the factor Xa inhibitors (FXaIs) rivaroxaban, apixaban 
      and edoxaban (100 µg in total). To evaluate drug-drug interactions, the impact of 
      ketoconazole, a known strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein, 
      was studied. METHODS: In a crossover clinical trial, 18 healthy volunteers were 
      randomized to the two treatments using microdoses of rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban alone and when coadministered with ketoconazole. Plasma and urine 
      concentrations of microdosed apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban were quantified 
      using a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification of 2.5 pg/ml. RESULTS: 
      The microdosed FXaI cocktail showed similar pharmacokinetic parameters compared 
      with published data, using normal therapeutic doses of each FXaI. Ketoconazole 
      significantly increased exposure, with geometric mean AUC ratios of 1.90 
      (apixaban), 2.35 (edoxaban) and 2.27 (rivaroxaban). CONCLUSION: The microdosed 
      FXaI cocktail approach was able to precisely predict the drug interaction with 
      ketoconazole. This is the first study that has been conducted to evaluate 
      drug-drug interactions with a drug class, and the low administered doses also 
      allow evaluation in vulnerable target populations. STUDY PROTOCOL: EudraCT 
      2016-003024-23.

TI  - Treatment of venous thromboembolism with rivaroxaban in relation to body weight. 
      A sub-analysis of the EINSTEIN DVT/PE studies.
PG  - 739-46
LID - 10.1160/TH16-02-0087 [doi]
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of oral rivaroxaban are highly predictable and only affected 
      to a limited extent by bodyweight; therefore, dose adjustments for bodyweight are 
      not required. However, this raises concerns among physicians for potential under- 
      or overdosing. This substudy of the randomised EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE 
      trials, which compared rivaroxaban with enoxaparin/vitamin K antagonist (VKA) 
      therapy, aimed to determine the incidence of major bleeding in patients with a 
      low bodyweight and recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with a high 
      bodyweight during rivaroxaban or enoxaparin/VKA therapy. More than 8,000 patients 
      with objectively diagnosed deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism were 
      included. Adjusted hazard ratios for recurrent VTE and bleeding were calculated 
      using the Cox proportional hazards model. Analyses were performed for both the 
      first 21 days of treatment and the whole treatment period. For rivaroxaban 
      recipients, there was no association between bodyweight or body mass index (BMI) 
      and risk of recurrent VTE (ptrend=0.87 and 0.62, respectively), major bleeding 
      (ptrend=0.24 and 0.36, respectively) or clinically relevant bleeding (ptrend=0.17 
      and 0.63, respectively). Major bleeding events were numerically lower in 
      rivaroxaban patients across all bodyweight and BMI categories. Hazard ratios for 
      rivaroxaban vs enoxaparin/VKA were similar in all bodyweight and BMI categories, 
      both during the first 21 days and the whole treatment period. The fixed-dose 
      rivaroxaban regimen is not associated with an increased risk of major bleeding or 
      recurrent VTE in patients with either a low or high bodyweight. A high BMI was 
      not associated with an increased risk of recurrent VTE during anticoagulation.

TI  - Rivaroxaban: a novel anticoagulant.
PG  - 520-8
AB  - For more than 50 years, warfarin has single-handedly ruled the world of 
      anti-coagulation without any competition, whatsoever! The anticoagulant was made 
      available in 1940 and since then no other anti-coagulant has ever been able to 
      match it in the clinical arena. But it looks like that the advances in the field 
      of anti-coagulation, for the first time, have seriously started to erode its 
      base. This review takes a look at rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor and 
      one of the most foremost competitors of warfarin.

AB  - In the last few years, several phase III clinical trials of new drug treatments 
      for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) have been carried out or are about to finish. 
      These drugs have a predictable and reliable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      response and do not require monitoring and are consequently an attractive 
      alternative for the treatment of a high proportion of patients with DVT. 
      Dabigatran, edoxaban and idrabiotaparinux have been developed as an alternative 
      to warfarin, and apixaban and rivaroxaban as one-drug only treatment for this 
      disease, with a 1- or 3-week intensified phase of initial treatment, 
      respectively. So far, the reported results show non-inferior efficacy and safety 
      to warfarin or to conventional treatment. Therefore, the new anticoagulants will 
      be particularly useful in patients with unstable INRs, warfarin incompatible 
      pharmacologic interactions, and in those without access to regular coagulation 
      monitoring.

AB  - The use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) has become a 
      breakthrough in anticoagulant treatment and it is expected to rise significantly 
      in upcoming years. The use of conventional anticoagulants have several 
      limitations: subcutaneous administration of heparin, or close monitoring of INR 
      during application of vitamin K antagonists. In the last decade, target-specific 
      oral anticoagulants (TSOAC) including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban 
      have been marketed for prophylaxis and treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to 
      understand the potential uses, side effects, and management of these agents in 
      routine practice. NOACs have major pharmacologic advantages, including a rapid 
      onset and offset of action, fewer drug interactions than conventional 
      anticoagulants, and predictable pharmacokinetics. These agents are gaining 
      popularity among both physicians and patients because of their easiness of 
      administration and the eliminating the requirement for regular coagulation 
      monitoring. In this review, we focus on discussing practical recommendations for 
      the use of NOACs and the risks and benefits of incorporating them into routine 
      practice.

AB  - Dabigatranetexilate and rivaroxaban were approved for prevention of 
      thromboembolic events after orthopedic surgery in 2008. Dabigatran is a direct 
      inhibitor of thrombin and rivaroxaban of factor Xa. Inhibition is reversible and 
      the duration of action is predictable. Both drugs considerably influence the 
      global tests of coagulation thus making postoperative coagulation monitoring more 
      difficult. In order to keep the interaction as low as possible blood samples for 
      assessment of the thromboplastin time (PT) and the partial thromboplastin time 
      (PTT) should be taken immediately before the next drug administration. Blood 
      sampling about 2-4 h after drug administration can be performed to check the 
      efficacy of drug action. Non-urgent operations should be started earliest 24 h 
      after the previous drug application. In cases of emergency interventions due to 
      life-threatening bleeding, administration of prothrombin complex concentrate 
      might be a successful treatment option. Specific antidotes are not available.

      plasma from patients with cirrhosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment and prevention of thrombotic complications is frequently 
      required in patients with cirrhosis. However anticoagulant therapy is often 
      withheld from these patients, because of the perceived bleeding diathesis. As a 
      result of the limited clinical experience, the anticoagulant of choice for the 
      various indications is still not known. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the in vitro 
      effect of clinically approved anticoagulant drugs in plasma from patients with 
      cirrhosis. PATIENTS/METHODS: Thirty patients with cirrhosis and thirty healthy 
      controls were studied. Thrombin generation assays were performed before and after 
      addition of unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, fondaparinux, 
      dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, to estimate anticoagulant potencies of these drugs. 
      RESULTS: Addition of dabigatran led to a much more pronounced reduction in 
      endogenous thrombin potential in patients compared to controls (72.6% reduction 
      in patients vs. 12.8% reduction in controls, P<0.0001). The enhanced effect of 
      dabigatran was proportional to the severity of disease. In contrast, only a 
      slightly increased anticoagulant response to heparin and low molecular weight 
      heparin and even a reduced response to fondaparinux and rivaroxaban was observed 
      in plasma from cirrhotic patients as compared to control plasma. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      anticoagulant potency of clinically approved drugs differs substantially between 
      patients with cirrhosis and healthy individuals. Whereas dabigatran and, to a 
      lesser extent, heparin and low molecular weight heparin are more potent in plasma 
      from patients with cirrhosis, fondaparinux and rivaroxaban showed a decreased 
      anticoagulant effect. These results may imply that in addition to dose 
      adjustments based on altered pharmacokinetics, drug-specific dose adjustments 
      based on altered anticoagulant potency may be required in patients with 
      cirrhosis.

      Anticoagulant Users.

AB  - Oral anticoagulants (OACs) pose a major bleeding risk, which may be increased or 
      decreased by concomitant medications. To explore medications that affect the 
      bleeding risk of OACs, we conducted a nested case-control study including 554 
      bleeding cases (warfarin, n = 327; direct OACs [DOACs], n = 227) and 1337 
      non-bleeding controls (warfarin, n = 814; DOACs, n = 523), using a Japanese 
      health insurance database from January 2005 to June 2017. Major bleeding risk 
      associated with exposure to concomitant medications within 30 d of the 
      event/index date was evaluated, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated 
      using logistic regression analysis. Several antihypertensive drugs, such as 
      amlodipine and bisoprolol, were associated with a decreased risk of bleeding 
      (warfarin + amlodipine [aOR, 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.41-0.98], 
      DOACs + bisoprolol [aOR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33-0.80]). As hypertension is considered 
      a significant risk factor for intracranial bleeding in antithrombotic therapy, 
      antihypertensive drugs may suppress intracranial bleeding. In contrast, 
      telmisartan, a widely used antihypertensive drug, was associated with an 
      increased risk of bleeding [DOACs + telmisartan (aOR, 4.87; 95% CI, 1.84-12.91)]. 
      Since telmisartan is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the elimination of 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban, which are substrates of P-gp, is hindered, resulting in 
      increased blood levels of both drugs, thereby increasing the risk of hemorrhage. 
      In conclusion, antihypertensive drugs may improve the safety of OACs, and the 
      pharmacokinetic-based drug interactions of DOACs must be considered.

TI  - Effectiveness of rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis of prosthetic heart valves in 
      a porcine heterotopic valve model.
PG  - 914-9
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt545 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Warfarin is used to reduce the risk of stroke and thromboembolic 
      complications in patients with mechanical heart valves. Yet, despite frequent 
      blood testing, its poor pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles often result 
      in variable therapeutic levels. Rivaroxaban is a direct competitive factor Xa 
      inhibitor that is taken orally. It inhibits the active site of factor Xa without 
      the need for the cofactor antithrombin, and thus, its mechanism of action is 
      differentiated from that of the fractionated heparins and indirect factor Xa 
      inhibitors. No in vivo data exist regarding the effectiveness of rivaroxaban in 
      preventing thromboembolic complications of mechanical heart valves. We tested the 
      hypothesis that rivaroxaban is as effective as enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis 
      of mechanical valves that use a previously described heterotopic aortic valve 
      porcine model. METHODS: A modified bileaflet mechanical valved conduit that 
      bypassed the native, ligated descending thoracic aorta was implanted into 30 
      swine. Postoperatively, the animals were randomly assigned to groups receiving no 
      anticoagulation (n = 10), enoxaparin at 2 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily (n = 
      10) or rivaroxaban at 2 mg/kg orally twice daily (n = 10). The amount of valve 
      thrombus was measured on post-implantation day 30 as the primary end point. 
      Quantitative evaluation of radiolabelled platelet deposition on the valve 
      prostheses was done and embolic and haemorrhagic events were measured as 
      secondary end points. RESULTS: Animals with no anticoagulation had a thrombus 
      mean of 759.9 mg compared with 716.8 mg with enoxaparin treatment and 209.6 mg 
      with rivaroxaban treatment (P = 0.05 for enoxaparin vs rivaroxaban). Similarly, 
      the mean number of platelets deposited on the valve prosthesis was lower in the 
      rivaroxaban group (6.13 × 10(9)) than in the enoxaparin group (3.03 × 10(10)) (P 
      = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, rivaroxaban was more effective than 
      enoxaparin for short-term thromboprophylaxis of mechanical valve prosthetics in 
      the heterotopic aortic position. It reduced valve thrombus and platelet 
      deposition on day 30 following implantation without increased adverse events. 
      Future studies would provide additional support for clinical trials evaluating 
      rivaroxaban as an alternative to warfarin for appropriately selected patients 
      with prosthetic aortic valves.

TI  - Randomized, double-blind, crossover study to investigate the effect of 
      rivaroxaban on QT-interval prolongation.
PG  - 67-77
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) is a novel, oral, direct Factor Xa 
      inhibitor in advanced clinical development for the prevention and treatment of 
      thromboembolic disorders. Unwanted pro-arrhythmic effects are a common reason for 
      drugs failing to gain regulatory approval; these properties can be detected by 
      assessing the effect of the drug on the QT interval. OBJECTIVE: This study was 
      performed, in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E14 
      guidance, to assess whether rivaroxaban prolongs the QT interval. STUDY DESIGN: 
      This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, four-way 
      crossover study. SETTING: The study was conducted at a clinical pharmacology 
      research unit. SUBJECTS: Healthy male and female subjects (n = 54) aged > or =50 
      years were enrolled and remained in the study unit for 3 days for each treatment. 
      Of these, 50 patients were eligible for the QT analysis. INTERVENTION: Subjects 
      received single oral doses of rivaroxaban 45 mg or 15 mg, moxifloxacin 400 mg 
      (positive control), or placebo. OUTCOME MEASURES: Multiple ECGs were taken at 
      frequent intervals after drug administration, and the QT interval was measured 
      manually under blinded conditions at a central laboratory. The Fridericia 
      correction formula (QTcF) was used to correct the QT interval for heart rate. The 
      primary outcome was the effect of rivaroxaban or moxifloxacin on the 
      placebo-subtracted QTcF 3 hours after administration. The frequency of outlying 
      QTcF values and the tolerability of the treatments were also assessed. RESULTS: 
      All treatments were well tolerated and had no effect on heart rate. Moxifloxacin 
      established the required assay sensitivity; placebo-subtracted QTcF 3 hours after 
      moxifloxacin administration was prolonged by 9.77 ms (95% CI 7.39, 12.15). 
      Placebo-subtracted QTcF values 3 hours after rivaroxaban administration were 
      -0.91 ms (95% CI -3.33, 1.52) and -1.83 ms (95% CI -4.19, 0.54) with rivaroxaban 
      45 mg and 15 mg, respectively. QTcF was not prolonged with rivaroxaban at any 
      time, and the frequency of outlying results with rivaroxaban and placebo was 
      similar. CONCLUSION: This thorough QT study, which was performed in accordance 
      with ICH E14 guidelines, shows that rivaroxaban does not prolong the QTc 
      interval. Therefore, the potential of rivaroxaban for the prevention and 
      treatment of thromboembolic disorders, including chronic cardiovascular 
      disorders, can be investigated in appropriate clinical studies without the need 
      for intensive monitoring of the QTc interval.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dilute Russell Viper Venom Time (DRVV-T) might be useful in urgent 
      settings for screening patients on Non-VKA Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs). AIM: To 
      compare the accuracy of DRVV-T with gold standard assays for the assessment of 
      pharmacodynamics of dabigatran, rivaroxaban and vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in 
      plasma samples from patients. METHODS: Sixty rivaroxaban, 48 dabigatran and 50 
      VKA samples from patients were included. DRVV-T was performed in all groups using 
      STA®-Staclot®DRVV-Screen and -Confirm. For NOACs, PT and aPTT were performed 
      using different reagents while plasma drug concentrations were measured by liquid 
      mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For VKA, INR was performed using RecombiPlasTin 
      2G®. RESULTS: For NOACs, correlations between calibrated 
      STA®-Staclot®DRVV-Confirm and LC-MS/MS (rs=0.88 and 0.97 for rivaroxaban and 
      dabigatran, respectively) were higher than the ones obtained with 
      STA®-Staclot®DRVV-Screen (rs=0.87 and 0.91), PT (rs=0.83 to 0.86) or aPTT 
      (rs=0.84 to 0.89). Bland Altman analyses showed that calibrated DRVV-T methods 
      tend to overestimate plasma concentrations of NOACs. ROC curves revealed that 
      cut-off to exclude supra-therapeutic levels at Ctrough (i.e. 200ng/mL) are 
      different for dabigatran and rivaroxaban. Neither STA®-Staclot®DRVV-Screen nor 
      -Confirm correlated sufficiently with the intensity of VKA therapy (rs=0.35 and 
      0.52). CONCLUSIONS: STA®-Staclot®DRVV-Confirm provides a rapid estimation of the 
      intensity of anticoagulation with rivaroxaban or dabigatran without specific 
      calibrators. At Ctrough, thresholds for rivaroxaban and dabigatran can be used to 
      identify supra-therapeutic plasma level. However, this test cannot differentiate 
      the nature of the NOACs. The development of a point-of-care device optimising 
      this method would be of particular interest in emergency situations.

AB  - Many patients under oral anticoagulation therapy need percutaneous or surgical 
      interventions/operations. For vitamin K antagonists (VKA), there are 
      recommendations regarding preoperative or postoperative administration. 
      Management of the new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) was supposed to be easier - but 
      some aspects must be considered. Due to the different pharmacokinetic profiles of 
      substances such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, different 
      recommendations are given.Upon periprocedural management, thromboembolic risk has 
      to be considered in patients treated with NOACs. NOACS have a pharmacokinetic 
      advantage in terms of a rapid onset and rapid elimination via the liver and 
      kidneys. Impaired renal function results in extended half-life of NOACs 
      considerably.Surgical procedures under NOACS can be scheduled at the beginning of 
      next dosing interval or omitted in low/minimal bleeding risk patients, so that 
      only 2-3 NOAC doses are not administered. In patients with moderate and high risk 
      of bleeding, there should be a NOAC break of 24-48 h prior to surgery in order to 
      allow a corresponding decay of the active metabolite. In patients with 
      low/intermediate risk for thromboembolism, no bridging is necessary if the 
      "unprotected" time (NOAC break) is less than 4-5-(7) days. In patients at high 
      risk of thromboembolism, individual consideration must be taken regarding 
      bridging or extended NOAC break. Whether NOACs can be dispensed or bridging is 
      necessary in these patients must be clarified in randomized trials for 
      periprocedural management of NOACs patients.

      compared to warfarin. We sought to clarify the different mechanisms responsible 
      for suppression of bleeding events using the Total Thrombus-formation Analysis 
      System (T-TAS), a flow-microchip chamber with thrombogenic surfaces. Blood 
      samples were obtained at Off- and On-anticoagulant (trough) from 120 consecutive 
      patients with atrial fibrillation (warfarin; n = 29, dabigatran; n = 19, 
      rivaroxaban; n = 47, apixaban; n = 25), which were used for T-TAS to compute the 
      area under the curve (AUC) (AR(10)-AUC(30)) in the AR chip, and to measure plasma 
      concentrations of DOACs at On-anticoagulant. In addition, the two-dimensional 
      area covered by thrombi (%) in the capillary was analyzed every 3 minutes after 
      sample applications. The AR(10)-AUC(30) correlated weakly and negatively with 
      plasma concentrations of DOACs, and the levels at On-anticoagulant were lower in 
      all groups than at Off-anticoagulant. AR(10)-AUC(30) levels at Off- and 
      On-anticoagulant were identical among the groups. The thrombi areas in early 
      phase were significantly larger in rivaroxaban and apixaban than warfarin and 
      dabigatran groups. The findings suggested that visual analysis of the AR-chip can 
      identify the differential inhibitory patterns of warfarin and DOACs on thrombus 
      formation under flow condition.

TI  - Possible Rivaroxaban Failure during the Postpartum Period.
PG  - e164-8
LID - 10.1002/phar.1662 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban, a factor Xa inhibitor, is a direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) 
      indicated for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism 
      (PE), and for reducing the risk of DVT and PE recurrence. To our knowledge, no 
      data are presently available to guide DOAC dosing in the postpartum period when 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes induced by pregnancy have an impact 
      on drug clearance and increase hypercoagulability for a period of 6-8 weeks after 
      delivery. We describe the case of a 35-year-old postpartum woman who presented to 
      the emergency department with a diagnosis of a new multiple segmental PE 5 days 
      after starting rivaroxaban therapy for a diagnosis of DVT. No precipitating 
      cause, including noncompliance, was identified as a source of thrombosis 
      embolization or extension. The patient was admitted, a heparin infusion was 
      started for the management of PE, and rivaroxaban was discontinued. She was 
      transitioned to enoxaparin 1 mg/kg (90 mg) subcutaneously every 12 hours the next 
      day, bridged to warfarin, and discharged home on the overlapping regimen with 
      close follow-up by the pharmacist-managed outpatient Anticoagulation Management 
      Service. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of potential failure 
      associated with rivaroxaban therapy in the postpartum period, possibly due to 
      pharmacokinetic alterations seen in the postpartum period contributing to 
      decreased drug exposure, yielding reduced anticoagulant efficacy. Clinicians 
      should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of DOAC therapy in postpartum 
      patients or other special populations requiring anticoagulation therapy. This 
      report also highlights the need for further research identifying the impact of 
      pharmacokinetic changes induced by special populations and the need to develop 
      monitoring assays for such clinical situations.

TI  - New oral anticoagulants: a practical guide for clinicians.
PG  - 182-91
LID - 10.1007/s11239-009-0409-0 [doi]
AB  - The search for an oral anticoagulant with acceptable efficacy and safety in the 
      treatment and prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolism, but with 
      practical advantages over warfarin, has been a focus of drug development for many 
      years. Three oral agents, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, are nearing 
      approval in the US. Their use in practice will be guided by the clinical trials 
      available, as well as their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. 
      Practitioners need to be fully aware of these characteristics in order to use 
      these agents appropriately in clinical practice. This review compares the results 
      of the phase 3 trials investigating these agents in the prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, examines the reporting 
      of bleeding complications in the trials, and highlights various practical 
      considerations regarding their use in clinical practice.

TI  - Serum Concentrations and Elimination Rates of Direct-Acting Oral Anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) in Older Hip Fracture Patients Hospitalized for Surgery: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 65-71
LID - 10.1007/s40266-018-0609-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is increasing, but 
      knowledge about pharmacokinetics and safety in frail patients is lacking. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine serum concentrations and elimination rates of 
      DOACs in older hip fracture patients hospitalized for surgery. METHODS: The study 
      included patients ≥ 65 years of age hospitalized for acute hip fracture surgery 
      over a period of 6 months. Use of antithrombotic drugs was registered and serum 
      samples collected for analysis of DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban) at 
      admission and surgery. Measured concentrations were assessed in relation to 
      reference (therapeutic) ranges of the respective drugs and applied for half-life 
      calculations. Furthermore, waiting time for surgery was compared between DOAC and 
      warfarin users. RESULTS: Of 167 patients included (median age 84 years), 11 and 
      14 used DOACs and warfarin, respectively. Seven of the DOAC-treated patients had 
      concentrations above the upper reference range (> 300 nM) at admission, and 
      concentrations were still in the reference range for five of these at surgery. 
      Elimination half-lives could be estimated in eight patients and ranged between 
      14.6 and 59.7 h (median 21.6). The observed waiting time for surgery was longer 
      for patients using DOACs than warfarin (median 44 vs. 25 h). CONCLUSION: This 
      pilot study indicates that older patients prone to hip fracture are at risk of 
      being exposed to therapeutic serum concentrations of DOACs during surgery due to 
      reduced drug elimination rates. The observation that almost 50% of the patients 
      had therapeutic concentrations at surgery should be investigated further 
      regarding safety of DOAC use in this frail elderly population.

TI  - Novel oral anticoagulants in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes: is there 
      any room for new anticoagulants?
PG  - 195-208
AB  - Thrombosis plays a key role in the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes 
      (ACS). The management of patients with ACS includes interventional procedures and 
      use of antithrombotic agents acutely, and dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and 
      a P2Y12 receptor antagonist) for secondary prevention. However, patients with 
      recent ACS remain at a substantial residual risk for recurrent ischemic events or 
      death. The idea of follow-up treatment with an oral anticoagulant on top of 
      standard therapy seems promising. Warfarin was the first oral anticoagulant 
      thoroughly investigated in this direction, but the widespread long-term use of 
      warfarin in ACS has been limited by challenges associated with 
      pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic deficiencies of the drug and the risk of 
      bleeding. Novel oral anticoagulants, such as direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) 
      and FXa inhibitors overcome the downsides of VKAs. Ximelagatran was the first 
      DTI, investigated and proven to be effective in prevention of recurrent ischemic 
      events in ACS patients, but the drug association with hepatotoxicity prompted its 
      withdrawal. Dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, darexaban (YM150) and TAK-442 were 
      studied in phase II dose-escalation trials in order to determine the balance 
      between clinical effectiveness and bleeding risk in daily use with dual 
      antiplatelet therapy, with both positive and negative results. Rivaroxaban is the 
      only agent that completed a phase III trial, showing reduction in recurrent 
      ischemic events rate and death from cardiovascular causes as well as all-cause 
      death. This review summarizes the data from completed and ongoing clinical trials 
      of the new oral anticoagulants in patients with ACS.

AB  - Altered direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) plasma levels can lead either to 
      spontaneous hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. We describe a case of 
      suspected altered apixaban disposition in a patient with an upper 
      gastrointestinal cancer resection treated with apixaban for non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation. Diagnosis of ischemic stroke for left hemiparesis was confirmed due 
      to recent emergence of a hypodense area in the posterior capsular nucleus of 
      ischemic reference in a context of binuclear capsular lacunar lesions. Thus, 
      apixaban underexposure was suspected from anamnestic data and oral 
      anticoagulation was switched to parenteral at the next scheduled dose for stroke 
      recurrence. Before switching apixaban pharmacokinetic analysis was performed and 
      unexpectedly showed apixaban plasma overexposure. After 3 days from the switch, 
      the patient experienced spontaneous bleeding complications, for which the 
      risk-benefit profile of continuing anticoagulant treatment for stroke recurrences 
      warranted treatment discontinuation. Unexpected DOAC plasma exposure may present 
      in special patient populations with thrombotic and bleeding complications. Though 
      universally recognized therapeutic ranges have yet to be established for DOACs, 
      periodic drug monitoring may aid in guiding optimization of DOAC therapy and 
      reduce the risk of adverse events in special patient populations.

TI  - Enhancing the Quality of Rivaroxaban Exposure Estimates Using Prothrombin Time in 
      the Absence of Pharmacokinetic Sampling.
PG  - 805-814
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12444 [doi]
AB  - Prothrombin time (PT) is a measure of coagulation status and was assessed in the 
      majority of patients in the rivaroxaban phase II and III clinical trials as a 
      pharmacodynamic marker. In the absence of sufficient phase III pharmacokinetic 
      (PK) data to provide individual exposure measures for input into rivaroxaban 
      exposure-response analyses, the aim of the present study was to investigate the 
      use of PT-adjustment approaches (i.e., the use of observed individual PT 
      measurements) to enhance the prediction of individual rivaroxaban exposure 
      metrics (derived using a previously developed integrated population PK model) 
      based on the observed linear relationship between PT and rivaroxaban plasma 
      concentrations. The PT-adjustment approaches were established using time-matched 
      PK and PT measurements, which were available from 1,779 patients across four 
      phase II trials and one phase III trial of rivaroxaban. PT-adjusted exposure 
      estimates improved the identification of statistically significant effects when 
      compared with covariate-only exposure estimates.

TI  - Evaluation of a Heparin-Calibrated Antifactor Xa Assay for Measuring the 
      Anticoagulant Effect of Oral Direct Xa Inhibitors.
PG  - 423-8
LID - 10.1177/1076029616629759 [doi]
AB  - The introduction of oral direct anti-Xa anticoagulants apixaban and rivaroxaban 
      has significantly impacted the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic 
      disease. Clinical scenarios exist in which a quantitative assessment for degree 
      of anticoagulation due to these agents would aid management. The purpose of this 
      work was to evaluate the chromogenic antifactor Xa assay calibrated with heparin 
      standards at our institution for assessment of intensity of anticoagulation with 
      rivaroxaban or apixaban in addition to its current use for unfractionated heparin 
      or low-molecular-weight heparin. We also aimed to propose expected steady state 
      peak and trough antifactor Xa activities for these agents based upon dosing 
      regimens approved for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Antifactor Xa activity 
      correlated very strongly with apixaban and rivaroxaban concentration in both 
      spiked samples and treated patient plasma samples (r (2) = .99, P < .001). This 
      correlation was observed over a broad range (20-500 ng/mL) of drug 
      concentrations, as sample dilution with pooled normal plasma significantly 
      extended the range of quantitative assessment. Based on drug concentrations 
      previously published in pharmacokinetic studies, the expected steady state peak 
      and trough antifactor Xa activity ranges for apixaban are 1.80 to 2.20 IU/mL and 
      0.70 to 1.10 IU/mL, respectively. For rivaroxaban, these ranges are 3.80 to 6.20 
      IU/mL and 0.60 to 1.00 IU/mL, respectively. In conclusion, our findings 
      demonstrate that heparin-calibrated antifactor Xa activity correlates strongly 
      with apixaban and rivaroxaban concentration. The dilution of samples allowed for 
      this correlation to be extended over the majority of on-therapy drug 
      concentrations.

PG  - 119-25
AB  - The first factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban had been released on market, and 
      apixaban and edoxaban are preparing for clinical use in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation. These newer antithrombotic agents are attractive for prevention of 
      thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation because of their favorable 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles that seems to be better than that of 
      direct thrombin inhibitor. The reports of rivaroxaban and apixaban have been 
      showed noninferiority or superiority in their efficacy endpoints and also in 
      safety endpoints even on fixed dose regimen without anticoagulation monitoring. 
      There may be still present an important issue that we have to pay attention to 
      find appropriate doses for the patients with renal impairment, aged or low body 
      weight.

TI  - Morbidly Obese Patient on Rivaroxaban Presents With Recurrent Upper Extremity 
      Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Case Report.
PG  - 712-719
LID - 10.1177/0897190019851358 [doi]
AB  - A morbidly obese patient with history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary 
      embolism was diagnosed with an acute left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis 
      and started on rivaroxaban. Three months later, the patient returned with 
      swelling in the right arm and was found to have a right brachial thrombosis. 
      Anticoagulant therapy was switched to a low-molecular-weight heparin, and patient 
      was discharged on enoxaparin along with an order to follow-up with a 
      hematologist. Subanalyses from randomized controlled trials, 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, and real-world studies suggest that rivaroxaban 
      may be effective and safe in morbidly obese patients for primary and secondary 
      prevention of venous thromboembolism. However, the Scientific and Standardization 
      Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis does not 
      recommend the use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants in this population. If 
      used, drug levels should be monitored to guide the therapy. Due to the disparity 
      in data to show efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in morbidly obese subjects, 
      the interpatient variability of rivaroxaban's effects in subjects, and the lack 
      of defined therapeutic range for rivaroxaban drug concentration, rivaroxaban 
      should be used cautiously in this population.

TI  - Contribution of rivaroxaban to the international normalized ratio when switching 
      to warfarin for anticoagulation as determined by simulation studies.
PG  - 959-66
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12571 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study evaluated the influence of rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily on 
      international normalized ratio (INR) during the co-administration period when 
      switching from rivaroxaban to warfarin. METHODS: We developed a calibrated 
      coagulation model that was qualified with phase I clinical data. Prothrombin time 
      and INR values were simulated by use of phospholipid concentrations that matched 
      Neoplastin Plus® and Innovin® reagents. To simulate the combined effects of 
      rivaroxaban and warfarin on INR during switching, warfarin initiation was 
      simulated by adjusting the magnitude of the warfarin effect to reach the desired 
      target INRs over the course of 21 days. The warfarin effect values (obtained 
      every 6 h) and the desired rivaroxaban plasma concentrations were used. Nomograms 
      were generated from rivaroxaban induced increases in INR. RESULTS: The simulation 
      had good prediction quality. Rivaroxaban induced increases in the total INR from 
      the warfarin attributed INR were seen, which increased with rivaroxaban plasma 
      concentration. When the warfarin only INR was 2.0-3.0, the INR contribution of 
      rivaroxaban with Neoplastin Plus® was 0.5-1.2, decreasing to 0.3-0.6 with 
      Innovin® at median trough rivaroxaban plasma concentrations (38 μg l(-1) ). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that measuring warfarin induced changes in INR are 
      best performed at trough rivaroxaban concentrations (24 h after rivaroxaban 
      dosing) during the co-administration period when switching from rivaroxaban to 
      warfarin. Furthermore, Innovin® is preferable to Neoplastin Plus® because of its 
      substantially lower sensitivity to rivaroxaban, thereby reducing the influence of 
      rivaroxaban on the measured INR.

TI  - Use of specific anti-Xa levels in acute kidney injury to transition patients from 
      oral factor Xa inhibitors to i.v. heparin infusion.
PG  - 505-511
LID - 10.1093/ajhp/zxz013 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This case series presents 3 patients with acute kidney injury taking 
      apixaban or rivaroxaban and transitioning to a heparin infusion. SUMMARY: Case 1 
      was a 78-year-old man admitted with respiratory failure, acute decompensated 
      heart failure, and acute kidney injury. He was taking apixaban for atrial 
      flutter. He was transitioned to an i.v. heparin infusion and had 2 consecutive 
      heparin antifactor-Xa levels greater than 2 units/mL. Heparin was held and 
      resumed about 36 hours later when the apixaban anti-Xa level was less than 50 
      ng/mL. Case 2 was a 55-year-old man admitted with acute kidney injury, taking 
      apixaban for a recent deep vein thrombosis. Apixaban anti-Xa levels were 
      monitored and i.v. heparin was initiated when the level was less than 100 ng/mL, 
      about 56 hours after the last apixaban dose. Case 3 was a 64-year-old woman 
      admitted with sepsis and acute kidney injury taking rivaroxaban for pulmonary 
      embolism, which occurred 2 weeks prior to admission. Rivaroxaban anti-Xa levels 
      were monitored and i.v. heparin was initiated about 36 hours after the last dose 
      when the level was less than 100 ng/mL. The management strategy did not lead to 
      any thrombotic outcomes; however, 1 patient experienced bleeding. CONCLUSION: 
      Specific anti-Xa levels for rivaroxaban and apixaban appeared to be helpful in 
      the transition of 3 patients to unfractionated heparin infusions in the setting 
      of acute kidney injury. These levels provided enhanced, individualized care and 
      likely helped avoid over and under anticoagulation.

TI  - Drug-drug interactions with direct oral anticoagulants: development of a 
      consensus list for ambulatory care.
PG  - 364-374
LID - 10.1007/s11096-022-01511-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) can be involved in clinical 
      relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) which may compromise safe and effective 
      use. However, assessing the clinical relevance of DDIs with DOACs and managing 
      these interactions optimally, can be challenging in clinical practice. AIM: To 
      develop a practice-oriented list of potentially clinically relevant DDIs with 
      DOACs with corresponding management plans for which it is important to screen in 
      ambulatory care. METHOD: The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method was used to develop 
      the DOACs DDI list. In a first step a preliminary list was compiled of 
      potentially clinically relevant DDIs per DOAC (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, 
      rivaroxaban) using five reference sources. Subsequently, a two-step modified 
      Delphi process involving a multidisciplinary panel (n = 10) including both 
      pharmacists and physicians with expertise in all decision-making disciplines 
      involved in care for patients using DOACs and with diversity of practice setting, 
      was used to reach expert agreement on a final list of DDIs with corresponding 
      management plans. RESULTS: After a two-step consensus round, 71 DDIs for 20 
      different interacting drugs were included: five pharmacodynamic, nine 
      pharmacokinetic inhibitor and six pharmacokinetic inducer interacting drugs. 
      Considerations raised and discussed by the panellists were related to (1) the 
      necessity of the interacting drug, (2) the manageability of the DDI (whether 
      there are any alternatives), (3) the (clinical) evidence-base for the DDI and (4) 
      the (potential) consequences of the DDI. CONCLUSION: We developed a consensus 
      list with specific and straightforward management plans on potentially clinically 
      relevant DDIs with DOACs, for use in ambulatory care.

TI  - Problem-Based Review: Non Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants for the Acute 
      Physician.
PG  - 83-9
AB  - Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), are direct anticoagulants 
      which inhibit specific coagulation factors and function as anticoagulants. Three 
      NOACs are currently licensed in the United Kingdom: dabigatran, a thrombin 
      inhibitor, and rivaroxaban and apixaban, antagonists of factor Xa. They are set 
      to change the anticoagulant landscape, which was previously ruled by warfarin and 
      heparins. Their advantages including oral formulations, rapid onset and offset of 
      action, predictable pharmacokinetics, no requirement for routine blood monitoring 
      or dose adjustment and very few drug interactions. The increasing use of these 
      drugs means the acute medicine physicians are likely to encounter patients who 
      have been taking them. This article reviews some of the challenging clinical 
      situations in which this may arise.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Stroke and venous thromboembolism (VTE) affect millions of 
      patients. The vitamin K antagonist, warfarin, has been the main oral 
      anticoagulant used to treat these conditions despite many limitations associated 
      with its use. Recently, multiple novel oral anticoagulants have been approved and 
      are reshaping how patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) at risk of stroke and 
      patients with VTE are treated. The direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran 
      etexilate , is among these novel agents that have been developed to overcome 
      limitations with warfarin. AREAS COVERED: In this article, authors describe the 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of dabigatran etexilate and 
      summarize the clinical evidence and controversy surrounding its use in the US, 
      Canada and Europe. EXPERT OPINION: Dabigatran has demonstrated similar efficacy 
      and safety to enoxaparin for VTE prevention in patients undergoing hip and knee 
      arthroplasty, and to warfarin for the treatment of VTE. Dabigatran (110 mg) is 
      noninferior and dabigatran (150 mg) is superior to warfarin for stroke prevention 
      in patients with nonvalvular AF, with a lower rate of intracranial hemorrhage 
      reported at both doses. Apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban provide alternate 
      anticoagulant options to dabigatran. While there are many similarities, there are 
      also significant differences to consider in agent selection based on 
      patient-specific characteristics.

TI  - Effect of food, an antacid, and the H2 antagonist ranitidine on the absorption of 
      BAY 59-7939 (rivaroxaban), an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor, in healthy 
      subjects.
PG  - 549-58
AB  - To investigate the influence of food and administration of an antacid 
      (aluminum-magnesium hydroxide) or ranitidine on the absorption of BAY 59-7939 
      (rivaroxaban), 4 randomized studies were performed in healthy male subjects. In 2 
      food interaction studies, subjects received BAY 59-7939, either as two 5-mg 
      tablets (fasted and fed), four 5-mg tablets (fasted), or one 20-mg tablet (fasted 
      and fed). In 2 drug interaction studies, BAY 59-7939 (six 5-mg tablets) was given 
      alone or with ranitidine (150 mg twice daily, preceded by a 3-day pretreatment 
      phase) or antacid (10 mL). Plasma samples were obtained to assess pharmacokinetic 
      and pharmacodynamic parameters of BAY 59-7939. In the presence of food, time to 
      maximum concentration (t(max)) was delayed by 1.25 hours; maximum concentration 
      (C(max)) and area under the curve (AUC) were increased, with reduced 
      interindividual variability at higher doses of BAY 59-7939. Compared with 
      baseline, BAY 59-7939 resulted in a relative increase in maximum prothrombin time 
      (PT) prolongation of 44% (10 mg) and 53% (20 mg) in the fasted state, compared 
      with 53% and 83% after food. Time to maximum PT prolongation was delayed by 0.5 
      to 1.5 hours after food, with no relevant influence of food type. No significant 
      difference in C(max) and AUC was observed with coadministration of BAY 59-7939 
      and ranitidine or antacid.

TI  - Thrombin generation and other coagulation parameters in a patient with homozygous 
      congenital protein S deficiency on treatment with rivaroxaban.
PG  - 165-72

AB  - Rivaroxaban, which targets factor Xa and does not reduce proteins C/S, was chosen 
      to treat a 6-year-old girl with homozygous protein S (PS) deficiency who 
      developed skin necrosis while on warfarin. Owing to the lack of experience with 
      rivaroxaban in children, the girl was started with 5 mg once-daily, which was 
      gradually increased to 40 mg daily. The increasing dosage was driven by the need 
      to avoid recurrence of skin necrosis. During dose-escalation, four 
      pharmacokinetics assays were carried out measuring drug plasma concentrations and 
      their effect on hemostatic parameters. We report the laboratory work-up, with 
      special reference to parameters of thrombin-generation. Rivaroxaban 
      concentrations by HPLC were correlated with those by the anti-factor Xa assay 
      (r(2) = 0.92, p < 0.01), but there was an overestimation by HPLC. 
      Thrombin-generation parameters, such as the area under the curve (referred to as 
      ETP), peak-thrombin, and velocity-index, when measured after addition of 
      thrombomodulin, showed unexpected changes: ETP decreased, but peak-thrombin and 
      velocity-index increased. Similar patterns were obtained in a PS-depleted plasma 
      and in plasma from patients with heterozygous PS deficiency, but not in plasma 
      from controls. In conclusion, these preliminary results suggest that PS may be a 
      determinant of velocity and peak-thrombin, but not of the total amount of 
      thrombin generated.

LID - 203
AB  - Perioperative management of patients treated with the non-vitamin K antagonist 
      oral anticoagulants is an ongoing challenge. Due to the lack of good clinical 
      studies involving adequate monitoring and reversal therapies, management requires 
      knowledge and understanding of pharmacokinetics, renal function, drug 
      interactions, and evaluation of the surgical bleeding risk. Consideration of the 
      benefit of reversal of anticoagulation is important and, for some low risk 
      bleeding procedures, it may be in the patient's interest to continue 
      anticoagulation. In case of major intra-operative bleeding in patients likely to 
      have therapeutic or supra-therapeutic levels of anticoagulation, specific 
      reversal agents/antidotes would be of value but are currently lacking. As a 
      consequence, a multimodal approach should be taken which includes the 
      administration of 25 to 50 U/kg 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates or 30 
      to 50 U/kg activated prothrombin complex concentrate (FEIBA®) in some 
      life-threatening situations. Finally, further studies are needed to clarify the 
      ideal therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, therapeutically indicated in 
      the treatment of thromboembolic diseases. As other new oral anticoagulants, 
      routine monitoring of rivaroxaban is not necessary, but important in some 
      clinical circumstances. In our study a high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method was validated to 
      measure rivaroxaban plasmatic concentration. Our method used a simple sample 
      preparation, protein precipitation, and a fast chromatographic run. It was 
      developed a precise and accurate method, with a linear range from 2 to 500 ng/mL, 
      and a lower limit of quantification of 4 pg on column. The new method was 
      compared to a reference method (anti-factor Xa activity) and both presented a 
      good correlation (r = 0.98, p < 0.001). In addition, we validated hemolytic, 
      icteric or lipemic plasma samples for rivaroxaban measurement by HPLC-MS/MS 
      without interferences. The chromogenic and HPLC-MS/MS methods were highly 
      correlated and should be used as clinical tools for drug monitoring. The method 
      was applied successfully in a group of 49 real-life patients, which allowed an 
      accurate determination of rivaroxaban in peak and trough levels.

TI  - Therapeutic Plasma Exchange for Urgent Rivaroxaban Reversal.
PG  - 96-98

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants, which include the factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban, 
      have some advantages over vitamin K antagonists in regard to stroke prevention in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation. However, no antidotes to reverse the effect of 
      oral anticoagulants are commercially available, which can complicate treating 
      patients in whom reversal is urgent. We faced this challenge in a kidney 
      transplant candidate, a 65-year-old man with end-stage renal disease who had been 
      taking rivaroxaban for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. When a deceased-donor 
      kidney became available, we needed to rapidly reduce the patient's bleeding risk, 
      while minimizing the cold ischemic time of the donor kidney. Therefore, we 
      decided to take an experimental approach and perform therapeutic plasma exchange. 
      The patient's plasma anti-factor Xa level decreased from 0.4 IU/mL immediately 
      before treatment to 0.21 IU/mL afterward, indicating that rivaroxaban had been 
      actively removed from circulation. Waste fluid showed significant anti-Xa 
      activity, indicating that the risk of rebound anticoagulation had been mitigated. 
      The patient subsequently underwent successful kidney transplantation. To our 
      knowledge, this is the first report of therapeutic plasma exchange to reverse the 
      effects of rivaroxaban in a patient undergoing urgent surgery. This treatment may 
      also be suitable for patients who have life-threatening, large-volume bleeding, 
      especially in the presence of substantial kidney or liver dysfunction.

TI  - Model-based dose selection for phase III rivaroxaban study in Japanese patients 
      with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 59-70
AB  - The global ROCKET AF phase III trial evaluated rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily 
      (o.d.) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). Based on rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics in Japanese subjects and lower anticoagulation preferences in 
      Japan, particularly in elderly patients, the optimal dose regimen for Japanese AF 
      patients was considered. The aim of this analysis was dose selection for Japanese 
      patients from a pharmacokinetic aspect by comparison of simulated exposure in 
      Japanese patients with those in Caucasian patients. As a result of population 
      pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics analyses, a one-compartment pharmacokinetic 
      model with first-order absorption and direct link pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
      models optimally described the plasma concentration and pharmacodynamic models 
      (Factor Xa activity, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and 
      HepTest), which were also consistent with previous works. Steady-state 
      simulations indicated 15 mg rivaroxaban o.d. doses in Japanese patients with AF 
      would yield exposures comparable to the 20 mg o.d. dose in Caucasian patients 
      with AF. In conclusion, in the context of the lower anticoagulation targets in 
      Japanese practice, the population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling 
      supports 15 mg o.d. as the principal rivaroxaban dose in J-ROCKET AF.

TI  - Impact of rivaroxaban plasma concentration on perioperative red blood cell loss.
PG  - 197-205
LID - 10.1111/trf.15560 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigates the impact of preoperative calculated 
      rivaroxaban (RXA) plasma concentration on perioperative red blood cell (RBC) 
      loss. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we 
      identified patients with RXA intake according to a preoperative determination of 
      RXA levels within 96 hours before surgery. RXA plasma concentration at the 
      beginning of surgery was then calculated from the last RXA intake using a 
      single-compartment pharmacokinetic model with four categories of RXA 
      concentration (≤20, 21-50, 51-100, and >100 μg/L). Patients were classified into 
      surgery with high (≥500 mL) or low (<500 mL) expected blood loss. Perioperative 
      bleeding was determined by calculating RBC loss. RESULTS: We analyzed 308 
      surgical interventions in 298 patients during the period from January 2012 to 
      July 2018. Among patients undergoing surgery with low expected blood loss, RBC 
      loss varied from 164 mL (standard deviation [SD], 189) to 302 mL (SD, 397) (p = 
      0.66), and no association of calculated RXA concentration with RBC loss was 
      observed. In patients undergoing surgery with high expected blood loss, we found 
      a significant correlation of calculated RXA concentration with RBC loss 
      (Pearson's correlation coefficient, 0.29; p = 0.002). RBC loss increased with 
      rising RXA concentration from 575 mL (SD, 365) at RXA concentration of 20 μg/L or 
      less up to 1400 mL (SD, 1300) at RXA concentration greater than 100 μg/L. RXA 
      concentration greater than 100 μg/L was associated with a significant increase of 
      in RBC loss of 840 mL (95% confidence interval, 360-1300; p < 0.001). Transfusion 
      of RBC and fresh frozen plasma units tended to increase in patients with RXA 
      concentrations greater than 100 μg/L. The proportion of patients treated with 
      prothrombin complex concentrate and coagulation factor XIII concentrate increased 
      significantly with higher RXA concentrations. CONCLUSION: Only in surgery with 
      high expected blood loss, a calculated RXA concentration of greater than 100 μg/L 
      was associated with a significant increase of perioperative RBC loss.

AB  - The objective of this study was to demonstrate the bioequivalence of 2 oral 
      tablet formulations of rivaroxaban 20 mg in healthy Mexican volunteers under fed 
      conditions. This phase I, single-blind, single-dose, randomized, two-sequence, 
      two-period crossover study included 32 volunteers. Subjects were randomly 
      assigned to one of two sequences: test formulation (single 20 mg dose) in the 
      first period followed by the reference formulation (single 20 mg dose) in the 
      second, or vice versa. Blood samples were collected predose and at predefined 
      timepoints across a 48-hour period after drug intake. Rivaroxaban plasma 
      concentrations were measured using a validated high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
      included maximum plasma concentration (C(max) ), area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve from time zero to last measurable concentration and to 
      infinity (AUC(0-t) , AUC(0-∞) ), time to reach C(max) , and half-life. Safety was 
      evaluated through adverse-event monitoring using subject interviews and recording 
      of vital signs. The 90% confidence intervals for the test/reference geometric 
      mean ratios of C(max) (100.4%-112.7%), AUC(0-t) (96.5%-111.6%), and AUC(0-∞) 
      (95.5%-109.5%) were within the bioequivalence acceptance range (80-125%). Two 
      adverse events (headaches) were recorded. Both formulations of rivaroxaban 20 mg 
      tablets were bioequivalent and well tolerated in a healthy population of Mexican 
      volunteers under fed conditions.

TI  - Use of Apixaban in Atrial Fibrillation With Ritonavir-Boosted Antiretroviral 
      Therapy: A Case Report.
PG  - 728-732
LID - 10.1177/08971900221074938 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) pose a challenge when given with 
      potent CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors, such as the commonly prescribed 
      pharmacokinetic booster ritonavir. As per the manufacturer, apixaban offers a 
      dose reduction when administered concurrently with ritonavir; thus, we explore 
      the clinical indication and safety of apixaban when given with ritonavir-boosted 
      highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in an HIV patient. Summary: We 
      describe a 73-year-old male with extensive cardiac history, including a past 
      medical history of resolved left ventricular thrombus, newly diagnosed 
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin, and HIV infection treated 
      with ritonavir-boosted HAART. The patient presented to the emergency department 
      with bleeding from multiple sites, necessitating the use of vitamin K. 
      Consequently, his hospital course was complicated by episodes of minor bleeding 
      and labile INR. Due to the complicated nature of his condition and the potential 
      for drug-drug interactions (DDIs), he was transitioned from warfarin to apixaban. 
      Since there is little readily available data to support the use of rivaroxaban 
      and dabigatran with ritonavir, our patient was safely started on dose-reduced 
      apixaban for stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation due to the predictable 
      nature of apixaban pharmacokinetics and proven superiority regarding adverse 
      effects, as compared to other DOACs. Conclusion: Dose-reduced apixaban is a safe 
      and viable choice in patients with atrial fibrillation warranting stroke 
      prophylaxis while concurrently receiving ritonavir-boosted HAART.

AB  - BACKGROUND: D-dimer levels measured during and after vitamin K antagonist 
      withdrawal may be used in clinical practice to assess the individual risk of 
      recurrent venous thromboembolism. Currently, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      are frequently used in venous thromboembolism treatment; however, their 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics characteristics are completely different 
      than vitamin K antagonists. The present study aimed at comparing the results of 
      D-dimer levels during and after anticoagulation withdrawal in patients with 
      venous thromboembolism treated with DOACs or warfarin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      D-dimer levels were measured in 527 patients ("cases") during DOACs treatment 
      (T0) and after 15 (T15), 30 (T30), 60 (T60) and 90 (T90) days after their 
      discontinuation and in 527 patients ("controls") enrolled in the DULCIS study 
      (all treated with warfarin), matched for sex, age (+/-3 y), type of D-dimer assay 
      and site of venous thromboembolism. Both cases and controls received 
      anticoagulant treatment after a first venous thromboembolism event that was 
      unprovoked or associated with weak risk factors. RESULTS: The rate of positive 
      D-dimer results was significantly higher in cases than in controls at T0 (10.8% 
      vs 5.1%, p = 0.002) and at T30 (18.8% vs 11.8%, p = 0.019), as well as at the 
      other time-points, though not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: D-dimer 
      levels during and after stopping an anticoagulant treatment for a venous 
      thromboembolism episode differ between patients treated with a DOAC than in those 
      treated with warfarin. Specifically designed prospective studies are warranted to 
      reassess the use of D-dimer as predictor of the risk of recurrent venous 
      thromboembolism in patients treated with DOACs.

AB  - In this study, a solid-phase extraction (SPE)-high performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC)-ultra violet (UV) method was developed for the 
      determination of rivaroxaban (RIV), an oral anticoagulant drug, in human plasma 
      samples. The concentration of RIV in plasma samples was increased 7.5 times and 
      the interference coming from matrix components was avoided by using SPE. The 
      extracted samples of RIV were analyzed by using an HPLC-UV method. RIV was 
      approved in 2008 and many studies have been published in recent years in order to 
      investigate its pharmacokinetic profile in various groups. In light of this 
      information, it is clear that the RIV pharmacokinetic profile should be 
      investigated in further studies; the HPLC-UV method presented in this study might 
      be an easy method to apply, as it is a cheap and rapid alternative to HPLC-MS-MS 
      for this purpose. A Phenomenex Luna 5-µm C18 100 Å LC column (250 × 4.6 mm) was 
      used for the separation of RIV and prednisolone (internal standard). The total 
      analysis time was <6 min. The method was validated according to the FDA 
      guidelines and can be proposed for pharmacokinetic studies of RIV.

TI  - Direct oral anticoagulants and the risk of adverse clinical outcomes among 
      patients with different body weight categories: a large hospital-based study.
PG  - 163-173
LID - 10.1007/s00228-023-03593-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Through predictable pharmacokinetics-including a convenient fixed-dose 
      regimen, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over previous 
      treatments in anticoagulation for various indications. However, the association 
      between higher body weight and the risk of adverse consequences is not well 
      studied among DOAC users. We aim to explore the association of body weight and 
      adverse clinical outcomes in DOAC users. METHODS: A total of 97,413 anonymised 
      DOAC users in a tertiary care setting were identified following structured 
      queries on the electronic health records (EHRs) to extract the feature-rich 
      anonymised dataset. The prepared dataset was analysed, and the features 
      identified with machine learning (ML) informed the adjustments of covariates in 
      the multivariate regression analysis to examine the association. Kaplan-Meier 
      analysis was performed to evaluate the mortality benefits of DOACs. RESULTS: 
      Among DOAC users, the odds of adverse clinical outcomes, such as clinically 
      relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB), ischaemic stroke, all-cause mortality, and 
      prolonged hospital stay, were lower in patients with overweight, obesity, or 
      morbid obesity than in patients with normal body weight. The odds of ischaemic 
      stroke (OR 0.42, 95% CI: 0.36-0.88, p = 0.001) and all-cause mortality (OR 0.87, 
      95% CI: 0.81-0.95, p = 0.001) were lower in patients with morbid obesity than in 
      patients with normal body weight. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, apixaban was 
      associated with a significantly lower rate of mortality overall and in obesity 
      and overweight subgroups than other DOACs (p < 0.001). However, rivaroxaban 
      performed better than apixaban in the morbid obesity subgroup (p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: This study shows the positive effects of DOAC therapy on clinical 
      outcomes, particularly in patients with high body weight. However, this still 
      needs validation by further studies particularly among patients with morbid 
      obesity.

TI  - Laboratory measurement of the direct oral anticoagulants: Indications and impact 
      on management in clinical practice.
PG  - 31-36
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.12654 [doi]
AB  - Although the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not require routine laboratory 
      monitoring, there may be special situations in which measurement of drug levels 
      is desirable. There is a paucity of information on how measurement of DOAC levels 
      is used in clinical practice. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban levels measured at our institution. Of 9793 
      patients with an active prescription for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban in 
      the electronic medical record during the 2.5-year study period, 32 (0.33%) 
      patients underwent a total of 37 DOAC measurements. Twenty patients were on 
      rivaroxaban, 12 were on apixaban, and none was on dabigatran. The most common 
      indications for measurement in inpatients were surgery, breakthrough thrombosis, 
      and bleeding. In the ambulatory setting, patient characteristics suspected to 
      lead to derangements in drug levels (eg, extremes of body weight, 
      gastrointestinal malabsorptive disorders) served as a frequent indication. Among 
      preoperative patients, DOAC levels influenced decisions about the timing of 
      surgery. In most outpatients, levels were within expected ranges and affirmed 
      current management. In a small number of patients with breakthrough thrombosis or 
      bleeding, the identification of drug levels below or above expected 
      concentrations led to a change in the anticoagulant regimen. In conclusion, DOAC 
      measurement was infrequently requested. Indications differed between hospitalized 
      patients and outpatients. Clinical response varied by drug level and indication.

TI  - How to handle the delayed or missed dose of rivaroxaban in patients with 
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation: model-informed remedial dosing.
PG  - 1153-1163
LID - 10.1080/17512433.2021.1937126 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban is an oral anticoagulant widely used for stroke 
      prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). During 
      long-term anticoagulant therapy, delayed or missed doses are common. This study 
      aimed to explore appropriate remedial dosing regimens for non-adherent 
      rivaroxaban-treated patients. METHODS: Monte Carlo simulation based on a 
      previously established rivaroxaban population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
      (PK/PD) model for patients with NVAF was employed to design remedial dosing 
      regimens. The proposed regimens were compared with remedial strategies in the 
      European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) guide by assessing deviation time in 
      terms of drug concentration, factor Xa activity, and prothrombin time. RESULTS: 
      The proposed remedial dosing regimens were dependent on delay duration. The 
      missed dose should be taken immediately when the delay does not exceed 6 h; a 
      half dose is advisable when the delay is between 6 and 20 h. A missed dose should 
      be skipped if less than 4 h remains before the next dose. The proposed regimens 
      resulted in shorter deviation time than that of the EHRA guide. CONCLUSION: PK/PD 
      modeling and simulation provide valid evidence on the remedial dosing regimen of 
      rivaroxaban, which could help to minimize the risk of bleeding and 
      thromboembolism.

TI  - Dabigatran Dosing Proposal for Adults With Atrial Fibrillation: Stress-Testing 
      Renal Function Range in Real World Patients.
PG  - 362-370
LID - 10.1002/cpt.2902 [doi]
AB  - Dabigatran is the first of four direct-acting oral anticoagulants approved to 
      prevent stroke in adult patients with atrial fibrillation using a fixed two-dose 
      scheme compared with warfarin dosing adjusted to a prothrombin time range 
      associated with optimal risk reduction in stroke and serious bleeding. The 
      pivotal phase III trial found dabigatran, depending on dose, is superior to 
      warfarin in stroke reduction and similar in bleeding risk while also showing 
      dabigatran efficacy and safety correlate with steady-state plasma concentrations. 
      Because the relationship between dabigatran dose and plasma concentration is 
      highly variable, a previously developed population pharmacokinetic model of over 
      9,000 clinical trial patients was used as a basis for simulations comparing the 
      performance of dosing via the drug label to other proposed doses and regimens. 
      Assessment of dosing regimen performance was based on simulations of trough 
      plasma levels within the therapeutic concentration range of 75-150 ng/mL over a 
      renal function range of 15-250 mL/min creatinine clearance, representing extremes 
      for real-world patients. An improved regimen that best achieves this therapeutic 
      range was identified, requiring five different dosing schedules, corresponding to 
      specified renal function ranges, compared with the two approved in the label. The 
      discussion focuses on how this information could better inform patient outcomes 
      and future dabigatran development.

TI  - Risk Factors for Higher-than-Expected Residual Rivaroxaban Plasma Concentrations 
      in Real-Life Patients.
PG  - 808-817
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1639585 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rivaroxaban (RXA) is a direct oral factor Xa (Xa) antagonist with a 
      short half-life and a fast onset and offset of effect. Before elective surgery, 
      discontinuation is recommended with an interval of at least > 24 hours. In 
      clinical practice, this is, however, not always sufficient to achieve a residual 
      RXA plasma concentration deemed appropriate for surgery, defined as ≤ 50 mcg/L. 
      Our study aimed at identifying factors associated with a higher-than-expected 
      residual RXA plasma concentration in a large group of real-life patients. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective single-centre study included all 
      patients taking RXA between 2012 and 2016 where RXA plasma concentration was 
      determined by pharmacodynamic anti-Xa assay (518 measurements in 368 patients). 
      Medical records were reviewed. Residual RXA plasma concentrations were then 
      compared with expected values according to a pharmacokinetic model. RESULTS: 
      Residual RXA plasma concentration was significantly higher-than-expected in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation, impaired kidney function (glomerular 
      filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min), CYP3A4-, CYP2J2- and PGP-inhibitory 
      co-medication including amiodarone. Impaired kidney function (odds ratio [OR], 
      2.22, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-3.78, p = 0.003) and concomitant 
      amiodarone intake (OR, 1.97, 95% CI, 1.04-3.72, p = 0.036) were significantly 
      associated with RXA plasma concentrations > 50 mcg/L at 24 to 48 hours after the 
      last RXA intake. CONCLUSION: In our group of real-life patients, impaired kidney 
      function (GFR < 60 mL/min) and co-medication with amiodarone were independently 
      associated with higher-than-expected residual RXA plasma concentrations. In these 
      patients, standard intervals of RXA discontinuation may not always be sufficient 
      before elective surgery and routine pre-operative determination of the residual 
      RXA concentration could be advisable.

TI  - Plasma fibrin clot properties in the G20210A prothrombin mutation carriers 
      following venous thromboembolism: the effect of rivaroxaban.
PG  - 1739-1749
LID - 10.1160/TH17-01-0060 [doi]
AB  - We sought to investigate whether the G20210A prothrombin mutation modifies plasma 
      fibrin clot properties in patients after venous thromboembolism (VTE) and how 
      rivaroxaban treatment affects these alterations. We studied 34 prothrombin 
      mutation heterozygous carriers and sex- and age-matched 34 non-carriers, all at 
      least three months since the first VTE episode, before and during treatment with 
      rivaroxaban. Clot permeability (K(s)) and clot lysis time (CLT) with or without 
      elimination of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) were assessed 
      at baseline, 2-6 hours (h) after and 20-25 h after intake of rivaroxaban (20 
      mg/day). At baseline, the prothrombin mutation group formed denser clots (K(s) 
      -12 %, p=0.0006) and had impaired fibrinolysis (CLT +14 %, p=0.004, and CLT-TAFI 
      +13 %, p=0.03) compared with the no mutation group and were similar to those 
      observed in 15 healthy unrelated prothrombin mutation carriers. The G20210A 
      prothrombin mutation was the independent predictor for K(s) and CLT before 
      rivaroxaban intake. At 2-6 h after rivaroxaban intake, clot properties improved 
      in both G20210A carriers and non-carriers (K(s) +38 %, and +37 %, CLT -25 % and 
      -25 %, CLT-TAFI -20 % and -24 %, respectively, all p<0.001), but those parameters 
      were worse in the prothrombin mutation group (K(s) -12.8 %, CLT +17 %, CLT-TAFI 
      +13 %, all p<0.001). Rivaroxaban concentration correlated with fibrin clot 
      properties. After 20-25 h since rivaroxaban intake most clot properties returned 
      to baseline. Rivaroxaban-related differences in clot structure were confirmed by 
      scanning electron microscopy images. In conclusion, rivaroxaban treatment, though 
      improves fibrin clot properties, cannot abolish more prothrombotic fibrin clot 
      phenotype observed in prothrombin mutation carriers following VTE.

TI  - Utility of a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling approach to 
      quantitatively predict a complex drug-drug-disease interaction scenario for 
      rivaroxaban during the drug review process: implications for clinical practice.
PG  - 99-110
LID - 10.1002/bdd.1771 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban is an oral Factor Xa inhibitor. The primary objective of 
      this communication was to quantitatively predict changes in rivaroxaban exposure 
      when individuals with varying degrees of renal impairment are co-administered 
      with another drug that is both a P-gp and a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. METHODS: A 
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to simulate 
      rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics in young (20-45 years) or older (55-65 years) 
      subjects with normal renal function, mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, 
      with or without concomitant use of the combined P-gp and moderate CYP3A4 
      inhibitor, erythromycin. RESULTS: The simulations indicate that combined factors 
      (i.e., renal impairment and the use of erythromycin) have a greater impact on 
      rivaroxaban exposure than expected when the impact of these factors are 
      considered individually. Compared with normal young subjects taking rivaroxaban, 
      concurrent mild, moderate or severe renal impairment plus erythromycin resulted 
      in 1.9-, 2.4- or 2.6-fold increase in exposure, respectively in young subjects; 
      and 2.5-, 2.9- or 3.0-fold increase in exposure in older subjects. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These simulations suggest that a drug-drug-disease interaction is possible, which

      simulations render more mechanistic insights as to the possible outcomes and 
      allow one to reach a decision to add cautionary language to the approved product 
      labeling for rivaroxaban.

AB  - Rivaroxaban (RVX), an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, is being explored as an 
      alternative to traditional anticoagulans. However, RVX still faces 
      pharmacokinetic limitations and adverse effects, highlighting the need for more 
      effective formulations. In this regard, pharmaceutical nanotechnology, 
      particularly the use of polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs), offers a promising 
      approach for optimizing RVX delivery. This study aimed to develop and 
      physicochemically characterize RVX-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) 
      (PLGA)/sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) or didodecyl dimethylammonium bromide (DMAB) 
      nanoparticles, and also evaluate their pharmacological and toxicological profiles 
      as a potential therapeutic strategy. The PNPs exhibited sizes below 300 nm and 
      spherical morphology, with both negative and positive surface charges, according 
      to surfactant used. They demonstrated high encapsulation efficiency and suitable 
      yields, as well as rapid initial liberation followed by sustained release in 
      different pH environments. Importantly, in vivo evaluations revealed a 
      time-dependent antithrombotic effect surpassing the free form of RVX when 
      administered orally in SLS or DMAB PNP. No hemolytic or cytotoxic effects were 
      observed at various concentrations of the PNPs. Interestingly, the PNPs did not 
      induce hemorrhagic events or cause liver enzyme alterations in vivo. These 
      findings suggest that RVX-loaded SLS or DMAB PNPs are promising innovative 
      therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of thromboembolic diseases.

AB  - Thromboembolic disorders frequently require antithrombotic treatment during 
      pregnancy and lactation. Vitamin K antagonists and heparins are the treatment 
      options of choice in breastfeeding women. Factors including the route of 
      administration, discomfort during treatment, and fetal and neonatal safety affect 
      women's choices about anticoagulant therapy. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) have emerged as alternatives to these agents and may offer advantages 
      compared with vitamin K antagonists. As breastfeeding women were excluded from 
      clinical trials evaluating DOACs, no safety and efficacy data are available for 
      these special patients and, crucially, estimates for infant exposure are lacking. 
      Therefore, the manufacturer recommends against using DOACs during the lactation 
      period. We present the case of a patient who stopped breastfeeding owing to a 
      diagnosis of postpartum cardiomyopathy. Anticoagulation with enoxaparin that 
      commenced after the diagnosis of postpartum pulmonary embolism was switched to 
      rivaroxaban. At that time, breast milk samples were collected and rivaroxaban 
      concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. 
      Rivaroxaban appears in human breast milk in comparatively small amounts; its 
      safety has not been determined.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Uninterrupted drug therapy during acute illness is often associated 
      with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variations. Among warfarin treated 
      patients, these changes are reflected in the INR. However, in the case of direct 
      oral anticoagulants (DOACs), given that routine laboratory monitoring is not 
      recommended, these changes may result in unforeseen thromboembolic or bleeding 
      events. OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate of thromboembolic (TEE) and bleeding 
      events associated with uninterrupted DOAC compared to warfarin treatment during 
      acute illness. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients treated with 
      DOACs or warfarin, both at steady state, who were hospitalized for acute illness. 
      Primary outcome was any TEE or major bleeding requiring re-hospitalization within 
      one month from discharge. Secondary outcome was a composite of major bleeding and 
      clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) events. RESULTS: A total of 410 
      patients continued oral anticoagulant treatment during their hospitalization, of 
      whom 191 (46.6%) were on DOACs and 219 (53.4%) on warfarin, with a total of 18 
      (4.4%) events. Rates of TEE and major bleeding events did not differ between 
      DOACs and warfarin treated patients (0.9% vs. 0.5% and 0.5% vs. 1%, 
      respectively). Similarly, rate of secondary outcome was comparable between DOACs 
      (4.7%) and warfarin (2.7%, p = 0.29). Sub-analyses demonstrated significantly 
      higher rates among rivaroxaban (10.4%) treated patients compared to warfarin 
      (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Uninterrupted treatment with DOACs during acute illness 
      is not associated with increased risk for re-hospitalizations due to bleeding or 
      thromboembolic events compared to warfarin. Our results suggest a higher bleeding 
      rate among rivaroxaban treated patients at high bleeding risk.

      cross-national drug utilization study.
PG  - 2524-2539
LID - 10.1111/bcp.14071 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To estimate the incidence of direct oral anticoagulant drug (DOAC) use in 
      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and to describe user and treatment 
      characteristics in 8 European healthcare databases representing 6 European 
      countries. METHODS: Longitudinal drug utilization study from January 2008 to 
      December 2015. A common protocol approach was applied. Annual period incidences 
      and direct standardisation by age and sex were performed. Dose adjustment related 
      to change in age and by renal function as well as concomitant use of potentially 
      interacting drugs were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 186 405 new DOAC users (age 
      ≥18 years) were identified. Standardized incidences varied from 1.93-2.60 and 
      0.11-8.71 users/10 000 (2011-2015) for dabigatran and rivaroxaban, respectively, 
      and from 0.01-8.12 users/10 000 (2012-2015) for apixaban. In 2015, the DOAC 
      incidence ranged from 9 to 28/10 000 inhabitants in SIDIAP (Spain) and DNR 
      (Denmark) respectively. There were differences in population coverage among the 
      databases. Only 1 database includes the total reference population (DNR) while 
      others are considered a population representative sample (CPRD, BIFAP, SIDIAP, 
      EGB, Mondriaan). They also varied in the type of drug data source 
      (administrative, clinical). Dose adjustment ranged from 4.6% in BIFAP (Spain) to 
      15.6% in EGB (France). Concomitant use of interacting drugs varied between 16.4% 
      (SIDIAP) and 70.5% (EGB). Cardiovascular comorbidities ranged from 25.4% in 
      Mondriaan (The Netherlands) to 82.9% in AOK Nordwest (Germany). CONCLUSION: 
      Overall, apixaban and rivaroxaban increased its use during the study period while 
      dabigatran decreased. There was variability in patient characteristics such as 
      comorbidities, potentially interacting drugs and dose adjustment.

TI  - Comparing the Cost Effectiveness of Non-vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants 
      with Well-Managed Warfarin for Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Patients 
      at High Risk of Bleeding.
PG  - 317-325
LID - 10.1007/s40256-018-0279-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have compared the cost effectiveness of non-vitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and warfarin using results from clinical 
      trials evaluating NOACs. However, the time in therapeutic range (TTR) of warfarin 
      groups ranged across clinical trials, and all were below the therapeutic goal of 
      70%. We compared the cost effectiveness of edoxaban 60 mg, apixaban 5 mg, 
      dabigatran 150 mg, dabigatran 110 mg, rivaroxaban 20 mg, and well-managed 
      warfarin with a TTR of 70% in preventing stroke among patients with atrial 
      fibrillation at high risk of bleeding. METHODS: For the six treatments, we used a 
      Markov state-transition model to quantify lifetime costs in $US and effectiveness 
      in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We simulated relative risk ratios of 
      clinical events with each NOAC versus warfarin with a TTR of 70% using published 
      regression models that predict how the incidence of thrombotic or hemorrhagic 
      events changes for each unit change in TTR. We re-ran our analysis for two other 
      estimates of TTR: 65 and 75%. RESULTS: Treatment with edoxaban 60 mg cost 
      $US127,520/QALY gained compared with warfarin with a TTR of 70% and cost 
      $US41,860/QALY gained compared with warfarin with a TTR of 65%. However, warfarin 
      with a TTR of 75% was more effective and less expensive than all NOACs. For three 
      levels of TTR, apixaban 5 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, dabigatran 110 mg, and 
      rivaroxaban 20 mg were dominated strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The comparative cost 
      effectiveness of edoxaban and warfarin is highly sensitive to TTR. At the 
      $US100,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, our results suggest that warfarin 
      is the most cost-effective treatment for patients who can achieve a TTR of 70%.

TI  - New oral anticoagulants in development: potential for improved safety profiles.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Venous thromboembolism is the most frequent preventable cause of death in 
      hospitalized patients. Currently available anticoagulants have limitations that 
      restrict their widespread use, particularly in long-term indications. Vitamin K 
      antagonists require frequent monitoring and dose adjustment, and have a narrow 
      therapeutic window with the risk of bleeding. The low-molecular-weight heparins 
      have more predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and coagulation 
      monitoring is not required. However, their subcutaneous administration limits 
      their suitability for long-term use. Consequently, many patients fail to receive 
      effective preventive therapy. Rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran are new 
      anticoagulants in late-stage clinical development that inhibit a single, specific 
      coagulation factor, unlike the Vitamin K antagonists and low-molecular-weight 
      heparins. Studies suggest that they provide effective, predictable 
      anticoagulation with a low bleeding risk and will potentially offer an improved 
      clinical profile and wider safety margin compared with currently available 
      therapies.

TI  - On-Treatment Outcomes in Patients With Worsening Renal Function With Rivaroxaban 
      Compared With Warfarin: Insights From ROCKET AF.
PG  - 37-47
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.021890 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite rapid clinical adoption of novel anticoagulants, it is 
      unknown whether outcomes differ among patients with worsening renal function 
      (WRF) taking these new drugs compared with warfarin. We aimed to determine 
      whether the primary efficacy (stroke or systemic embolism) and safety (major 
      bleeding and nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding) end points from the ROCKET AF 
      trial (Rivaroxaban Once-Daily, Oral, Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With 
      Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial 
      Fibrillation trial) differed among participants with WRF taking rivaroxaban and 
      those taking warfarin. METHODS: After excluding patients without at least 1 
      follow-up creatinine measurement (n=1624), we included all remaining patients 
      (n=12 612) randomly assigned to either rivaroxaban or dose-adjusted warfarin. 
      On-treatment WRF (a decrease of >20% from screening creatinine clearance 
      measurement at any time point during the study) was evaluated as a time-dependent 
      covariate in Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics 
      were generally similar between patients with stable renal function (n=9292) and 
      WRF (n=3320). Rates of stroke or systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, and 
      bleeding were also similar, but WRF patients experienced a higher incidence of 
      vascular death versus stable renal function (2.21 versus 1.41 events per 100 
      patient-years; P=0.026). WRF patients who were randomized to receive rivaroxaban 
      had a reduction in stroke or systemic embolism compared with those taking 
      warfarin (1.54 versus 3.25 events per 100 patient-years) that was not seen in 
      patients with stable renal function who were randomized to receive rivaroxaban 
      (P=0.050 for interaction). There was no difference in major or nonmajor 
      clinically relevant bleeding among WRF patients randomized to warfarin versus 
      rivaroxaban. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with on-treatment WRF, rivaroxaban was 
      associated with lower rates of stroke and systemic embolism compared with 
      warfarin, without an increase in the composite bleeding end point. CLINICAL TRIAL

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are substrates for the ABCB1 transporter (also 
      called P-glycoprotein), an active efflux pump. ABCB1 polymorphisms have been 
      previously reported to influence the pharmacokinetics of several drugs such as 
      immunosuppressants and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Recently, in vivo studies have 
      suggested that genetic variants might contribute to the inter-individual 
      variability in DOAC plasma concentrations. Therefore, we evaluated the in vitro 
      effect of the most common coding ABCB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), 
      1236 C > T-2677G > T-3435C > T, and the coding ABCB1 1199 G > A SNP on the 
      transport activity towards rivaroxaban. HEK293 cells were transfected to 
      overexpress the ABCB1 wild-type (1236C-2677G-3435C, 1199 G) or variant proteins 
      (1236C-2677G-3435T, 1236T-2677T-3435T or 1199 A). ABCB1 expression decreased the 
      intracellular accumulation of rivaroxaban, when compared to control cells. This 
      confirms the involvement of ABCB1 in the active transport of rivaroxaban. 
      However, the ABCB1 1236 C > T-2677G > T-3435C > T and 1199 G > A SNPs had no 
      significant influence on the intracellular accumulation of rivaroxaban when 
      compared to the wild-type protein. These results suggest that the ABCB1 coding 
      SNPs investigated in the present study are unlikely to contribute to the 
      inter-individual variability in rivaroxaban plasma concentrations.

AB  - Pulmonary embolism is a critical medical condition and can lead to cardiovascular 
      arrest or death if left untreated. Pulmonary delivery of an anti-coagulant 
      therapeutic could provide a locally limited and efficient therapy, moreover 
      combined with a potentially fast onset of the therapeutic effect that is demanded 
      in emergency situations. Rivaroxaban (riva) was formulated as an inhalable dry 
      powder that can be administered directly to the lungs in order to reach high 
      local drug doses. Particles obtained spray drying dichloromethane-methanol 
      mixtures yielded an aerodynamic diameter of about or smaller than 5 µm and were 
      found to reach an emitted fine particle fraction (FPF(EF)) of at least 60 %. 
      Pulmonary administration to rats using a dry powder insufflator revealed a nearly 
      immediate therapeutic onset confirmed by the anticoagulant effects after 5 min in 
      the plasma, followed by a plateau over the next 4 h. Such rivaroxaban particles 
      were further formulated in binary blends using different lactose carriers 
      (Inhalac® 70/251/400). These interactive blends resulted in high emitted 
      fractions of at least 87 %, and furthermore, the highest fine particle fraction - 
      total dose (FPF(TD)) (60 %) of all tested formulations was achieved by using 
      Inhalac® 400 as a carrier. The data strongly suggest a significant therapeutic 
      potential of a rivaroxaban dry powder formulation, combining fast onset and a 
      plateau of plasma concentrations turning it into a potential first aid 
      therapeutic.

AB  - In this review we present comparison of pharmacokinetics of novel oral 
      anticoagulants (NOAC) dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, principles 
      of selection of a regimen of their dosing for phase III clinical trials in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation. Multiplicity of administration of NOAC depends 
      on required level of anticoagulation, ability to maintain anticoagulation for 24 
      hours, relationship between minimal and maximal levels of equilibrium 
      concentrations, efficacy and safety. Once a day administration of some drugs of 
      this group is reasonable from positions of clinical pharmacology. It can provide 
      not only better adherence to treatment but greater safety relative to development 
      of bleeding.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a powerful cardiovascular risk factor, its 
      presence is accompanied by an increased risk of hospitalization for exacerbation 
      of chronic heart failure (CHF), adverse outcomes in myocardial infarction, and 
      cardiovascular mortality. Among the adverse events, an increased risk of atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) should be noted. This article contains discussion of current 
      approaches to the treatment of AF in patients with different stages of CKD, data 
      on benefits of certain direct oral anticoagulants, as well as comparative 
      characteristics of therapy with direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin. 
      Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of direct oral anticoagulants, which 
      determine the features of therapy in CKD, are also considered.

TI  - In vitro assessment, using thrombin generation, of the applicability of 
      prothrombin complex concentrate as an antidote for Rivaroxaban.
PG  - 1111-8
LID - 10.1111/jth.12236 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban has been approved as an antithrombotic agent for 
      prevention of venous thromboembolism with specific indications. At present no 
      antidote is appointed and no guidelines have been formulated for the measurement 
      of Rivaroxaban reversal. OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we have evaluated the 
      influence of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) on the anticoagulant effects 
      of Rivaroxaban as measured by prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin generation tests 
      (TGTs). METHODS: Plasma and whole blood samples from healthy volunteers were 
      spiked with Rivaroxaban (up to 800 μg L(-1) ) and PCC was added to these samples 
      in concentration ranges as used clinically to reverse the effects of vitamin K 
      antagonists. PT, endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and calibrated automated 
      thrombography (CAT) assays were performed with varying tissue factor (TF) 
      concentrations. RESULTS: Addition of PCC to Rivaroxaban-spiked samples did not 
      result in normalization of PT and TGT lag time/T-Lag in ETP and CAT, 
      respectively. In contrast, normalization of ETP and CAT area under the curve did 
      occur. However, the response to PCC addition was strongly TF concentration 
      dependent and in whole blood less PCC was required for Rivaroxaban reversal as 
      compared with plasma. CONCLUSIONS: Prothrombin complex concentrate does not 
      neutralize the lengthening effect on PT and TGT lag time/T-Lag of Rivaroxaban 
      anticoagulated blood in vitro; however, total thrombin potential could be 
      normalized. Response of the different TGTs in this respect is assay condition 
      dependent. Therefore, prospective studies are needed to clarify which assay 
      condition and parameter describes in vivo hemostasis best in patients on 
      Rivaroxaban who are treated with PCC.

TI  - Dosing considerations in the use of the direct oral anticoagulants in the 
      antiphospholipid syndrome.
PG  - 104-106
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.12582 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVES: At least four prospective trials have been 
      initiated investigating the direct oral anticoagulants in the antiphospholipid 
      syndrome. Preliminary reports have supported their use in patients with a history 
      of venous thrombosis and a target INR of 2-3, but there have also been reports of 
      failure of these agents in the antiphospholipid syndrome. The objective is to 
      present a case report that illustrates there may be important dosing issues when 
      considering the use of these agents in patients with the antiphospholipid 
      syndrome. CASE SUMMARY: A 50-year-old woman with the antiphospholipid syndrome, 
      manifesting clinically with recurrent pyoderma gangrenosum-like leg ulcers, was 
      treated with apixaban, resulting in improved ulcer healing. For insurance 
      purposes, she was switched to rivaroxaban with worsening of the ulcers which 
      again improved when apixaban was resumed. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Despite a 
      similar half-life, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, the 
      manufacturer-recommended maintenance dosing of apixaban is twice daily and 
      rivaroxaban once daily. We believe this difference in recommended dose accounts 
      for the differential clinical response noted in the present case report and that 
      twice daily dosing and a larger daily dose of these agents may be more 
      efficacious in potent hypercoagulable disorders, such as the antiphospholipid 
      syndrome.

AB  - Bayer AG and Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc are developing rivaroxaban, an oral 
      Factor Xa inhibitor, for the potential prevention and treatment of thrombosis. In 
      December 2005 and December 2006, phase III trials were initiated for the 
      prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) following major orthopedic surgery and 
      in patients with atrial fibrillation, respectively. By January 2007, a phase III 
      trial for the prevention of VTE following total knee replacement surgery had 
      commenced. In November 2006, a phase II trial for the reduction of VTE in 
      patients with acute coronary syndrome was initiated.

TI  - Comparison of potential pharmacokinetic drug interactions in patients with atrial

AB  - There are now anticoagulant choices with proposed advantages of non-vitamin K 
      oral anticoagulants (NOACs) over warfarin being less routine monitoring and less 
      drug interactions. Interacting medication can impact the efficacy and safety of 
      anticoagulant therapy with management remaining clinically challenging. There 
      have been limited studies comparing the potential for pharmacokinetic (PK) drug 
      interactions between different anticoagulants. Therefore, the aim of this study 
      was to compare potential PK interactions in patients with atrial fibrillation 
      (AF) changing from warfarin to NOAC therapy. A retrospective analysis was 
      conducted of patients with AF enrolled in a dedicated warfarin program but 
      exiting this program to commence a NOAC. Patient data was collected, and 
      concurrent medications were utilised to identify potential PK drug interactions 
      with both warfarin and the chosen NOAC therapy. Patients were grouped according 
      to the number of medications with potential PK interactions and comparisons made 
      between groups. Of the 712 eligible patients who ceased warfarin to commence a 
      NOAC, most commenced either apixaban (45.9%) or rivaroxaban (41.9%). When 
      comparing warfarin to NOACs, there were significant differences in the proportion 
      of patients taking no medication with potential PK drug interactions (46.9% vs 
      62.8%, p < 0.0001), and taking one (35.2% vs 28.5%, p = 0.0067) and two (14.5% vs 
      7.3%, p < 0.0001) potentially PK interacting medications. This study found when 
      patients with AF were switched from warfarin to a NOAC, the potential for PK drug 
      interactions significantly reduced but remained around 40%. Identifying and 
      managing potential PK drug interactions with NOACs remains a priority to optimise 
      clinical benefit of these anticoagulants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are becoming the medication of 
      choice for the management of venous thromboembolism and stroke prevention in 
      atrial fibrillation because of simplified dosing, a more predictive 
      pharmacokinetic profile, and better clinical outcomes when compared with 
      traditional vitamin K antagonists. Recently, reversal agents for DOACs have been 
      approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in managing 
      life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding; however, for acute nonhemorrhagic 
      conditions requiring surgical intervention, such as acute hydrocephalus requiring 
      ventriculostomy, there is little evidence to help guide appropriate management 
      for patients on DOACs. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the use of andexanet alfa to 
      counteract rivaroxaban treatment in a 28-year-old woman who developed herniation 
      syndrome and acute hydrocephalus from a cerebellar tumor. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      describe how appropriate timing of administration of the DOAC reversal agent may 
      permit urgent neurosurgical intervention.

      Patients With Exclusion Criteria for Direct Oral Anticoagulants.

AB  - We assessed the real-life use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients 
      with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and exclusion criteria for randomized trials. 
      From 2013 to 2016, 3,578 of 18,853 patients (19%) had exclusion criteria. 
      Irrespective of which anticoagulant was chosen, they had more VTE recurrences 
      (hazard ratio (HR): 3.10; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.47-3.88), major bleeds 
      (HR: 4.10; 95% CI: 3.38-4.96), and deaths (HR: 9.47; 95% CI: 8.46-10.6) than 
      those without exclusion criteria. During initial therapy, no patient with 
      exclusion criteria on DOACs (n = 115) recurred, but those on rivaroxaban bled 
      less often (adjusted HR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.04-0.79) than those on unfractionated 
      heparin (n = 224) and similar to those (n = 3,172) on low-molecular-weight (LMWH) 
      heparin. For long-term therapy, patients on rivaroxaban (n = 151) had 
      nonsignificantly fewer VTE recurrences (adjusted HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.08-1.32) and 
      major bleeds (adjusted HR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.15-1.15) than those on LMWH (n = 
      2,071). The efficacy and safety of DOACs were similar to standard therapy.

      patients.

LID - 10.1177/1060028013503129 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report 2 cases in which point-of-care international normalized 
      ratios (POC-INRs) measured using a Hemochron Jr. Signature Elite device 
      (International Technidyne Corporation) were inaccurate in rivaroxaban-treated 
      patients. CASE SUMMARIES: Therapy in an 86-year-old man with atrial fibrillation 
      was converted from warfarin to rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily because of a deep 
      venous thrombotic event despite an INR of 2.4, which was within the therapeutic 
      range. One week later a POC-INR was inadvertently measured, which was 6.3. In 
      light of the POC-INR being markedly elevated, a laboratory test for INR was 
      performed, which gave a result of 2.74. Therapy in a 66-year-old man was 
      converted from war-farin to rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily because of unstable 
      INRs and a pulmonary embolism despite a therapeutic INR. Seven days after 
      rivaroxaban was started, the patient's POC-INR was 9.2; simultaneously measured 
      laboratory-determined INR was 2.0. For both patients, coagulation tests performed 
      on follow-up visits revealed continued discordance between the POC and laboratory 
      assays. DISCUSSION: Rivaroxaban is an oral factor Xa inhibitor with a predictable 
      pharmacokinetic profile, allowing for a fixed-dose regimen without the need for 
      coagulation monitoring. When patients' therapy is switched from rivaroxaban to 
      warfarin, it is recommended that the drugs be given concurrently until the INR is 
      2.0 or higher, to ensure adequate anticoagulation during this well-recognized 
      vulnerable period for stroke. POC testing is a common method of INR assessment in 
      clinical practice. During ROCKET-AF (Rivaroxaban Once-Daily, Oral, Direct Factor 
      Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and 
      Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation), POC-INRs were measured exclusively with 
      the INRatio device (Hemosense), and values above 4 were seen very rarely (0.25%), 
      which indicates that the values determined in our patients were highly unusual. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our 2 patients receiving rivaroxaban had POC-INRs elevated beyond 
      what was expected; these measurements were discordant from INRs simultaneously 
      measured via the laboratory. A prospective evaluation assessing the accuracy of 
      other commonly used POC-INR devices in patients receiving rivaroxaban would 
      determine whether our findings extend to other devices. Until that time, 
      laboratory measurement of INR or POC-INR using an INRatio device is recommended 
      when patients' therapy is transitioned from rivaroxaban to warfarin.

PG  - 1083-8
LID - 10.1517/14656560902835513 [doi]
AB  - The new oral, antithrombotic drug rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor, 
      which can restrict thrombin generation both in vitro and in vivo. It has a 
      predictable dose-dependent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and is 
      well tolerated. In patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty, 
      rivaroxaban, 10 mg once daily started 6 - 8 h after the operation, had a 
      significantly better antithrombotic efficacy and a comparable safety when 
      compared with enoxaparin. Furthermore in all studies performed the drug had no 
      adverse influence on the liver function in comparison with enoxaparin. In 
      conclusion, rivaroxaban is a potent and safe new compound for antithrombotic 
      prophylaxis in orthopaedic surgery.

TI  - Bodyweight-adjusted rivaroxaban for children with venous thromboembolism 
      (EINSTEIN-Jr): results from three multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban has been shown to be efficacious for treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism in adults, and has a reduced risk of bleeding compared with 
      standard anticoagulants. We aimed to develop paediatric rivaroxaban regimens for 
      the treatment of venous thromboembolism in children and adolescents. METHODS: In 
      this phase 2 programme, we did three studies to evaluate rivaroxaban treatment in 
      children younger than 6 months, aged 6 months to 5 years, and aged 6-17 years. 
      Our studies used a multicentre, single-arm design at 54 sites in Australia, 
      Europe, Israel, Japan, and north America. We included children with objectively 
      confirmed venous thromboembolism previously treated with low-molecular weight 
      heparin, fondaparinux, or a vitamin K antagonist for at least 2 months or, in 
      children who had catheter-related venous thromboembolism for at least 6 weeks. We 
      administered rivaroxaban orally in a bodyweight-adjusted 20 mg-equivalent dose, 
      based on physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling predictions and 
      EINSTEIN-Jr phase 1 data in young adults, in either a once-daily (tablets; for 
      those aged 6-17 years), twice-daily (in suspension; for those aged 6 months to 11 
      years), or three times-daily (in suspension; for those younger than 6 months) 
      dosing regimen for 30 days (or 7 days for those younger than 6 months). The 
      primary aim was to define rivaroxaban treatment regimens that match the target 
      adult exposure range. The principal safety outcome was major bleeding and 
      clinically relevant non-major bleeding. Analyses were per-protocol. The 
      predefined efficacy outcomes were symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism, 
      asymptomatic deterioration on repeat imaging at the end of the study treatment 
      period. These trials are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02564718, 
      NCT02309411, and NCT02234843. FINDINGS: Between Feb 11, 2013, and Dec 20, 2017, 
      we enrolled 93 children (ten children younger than 6 months; 15 children aged 6 
      months to 1 year; 25 children aged 2-5 years; 32 children aged 6-11 years; and 11 
      children aged 12-17 years) into our study. 89 (96%) children completed study 
      treatment (30 days of treatment, or 7 days in those younger than 6 months), and 
      93 (100%) children received at least one dose of study treatment and were 
      evaluable for the primary endpoints. None of the children had a major bleed, and 
      four (4%, 95% CI 1·2-10·6) of these children had a clinically relevant non-major 
      bleed (three children aged 12-17 years with menorrhagia and one child aged 6-11 
      years with gingival bleeding). We found no symptomatic recurrent venous 
      thromboembolism in any patients (0%, 0·0-3·9). 24 (32%) of 75 patients with 
      repeat imaging had their thrombotic burden resolved, 43 (57%) patients improved, 
      and eight (11%) patients were unchanged. No patient deteriorated. We confirmed 
      therapeutic rivaroxaban exposures with once-daily dosing in children with 
      bodyweights of at least 30 kg and with twice-daily dosing in children with 
      bodyweights of at least 20 kg and less than 30 kg. Children with low bodyweights 
      (<20 kg, particularly <12 kg) showed low exposures so, for future studies, 
      rivaroxaban dosages were revised for these weight categories, to match the target 
      adult exposure range. 61 (66%) of 93 children had adverse events during the 
      study. Pyrexia was the most common adverse event (ten [11%] events), and anaemia 
      and neutropenia or febrile neutropenia were the most frequent grade 3 or worse 
      events (four [4%] events each). No children died or were discontinued from 
      rivaroxaban because of adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Treatment with 
      bodyweight-adjusted rivaroxaban appears to be safe in children. The treatment 
      regimens that we confirmed in children with bodyweights of at least 20 kg and the 
      revised treatment regimens that we predicted in those with bodyweights less than 
      20 kg will be evaluated in the EINSTEIN-Jr phase 3 trial in children with acute 
      venous thromboembolism. FUNDING: Bayer AG, Janssen Research and Development.

TI  - Risk of major bleeding among users of direct oral anticoagulants combined with 
      interacting drugs: A population-based nested case-control study.
PG  - 1150-1164
LID - 10.1111/bcp.14227 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To assess the association between concurrent use of potential 
      pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interacting drugs and major bleeding among 
      direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) users. METHODS: We performed a case-control 
      study nested in a cohort of new users of DOACs (dabigatran etexilate, apixaban or 
      rivaroxaban). Data were obtained from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink 
      linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (2008-2015). Cases were patients 
      hospitalized having a primary diagnosis of major bleeding. Up to 4 controls were 
      matched on age, sex, index date and region. Odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of 
      major bleeding were assessed by conditional logistic regression analysis and 
      adjusted for well-known covariates for the risk of bleeding. RESULTS: We 
      identified 393 patients with a major bleeding from a total of 23 492 new users of 
      DOACs and 1494 matched controls. Most subjects were users of rivaroxaban (58.8%) 
      on the index date. The concurrent use of pharmacodynamic interacting drugs was 
      associated with an increased risk of major bleeding (21.6% of cases vs 13.5% of 
      controls, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      1.40-2.66). For the antiplatelet drugs the aOR was 2.01 (95% CI, 1.29-3.11) and 
      for the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors the aOR was 1.68 (95% CI, 
      1.10-2.59). We found no increased risk of major bleeding for concurrent use of 
      pharmacokinetic interacting drugs vs DOACs alone (45.0 vs 51.2%; aOR: 0.77; 95% 
      CI: 0.53-1.10). CONCLUSION: Among patients taking DOACs the concurrent use of 
      antiplatelet drugs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was associated with 
      increased risk of major bleeding, while pharmacokinetic interacting drugs do not 
      increase this risk.

TI  - Management of major bleeding and outcomes in patients treated with direct oral 
      anticoagulants: results from the START-Event registry.

AB  - The management of major bleeding in patients treated with direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) is still not well established. START-Events, a branch of 
      the START registry (Survey on anTicoagulated pAtients RegisTer) (NCT02219984), 
      aims to describe the actual management of bleeding or recurrent thrombotic events 
      in routine clinical practice. We here present the results of the management of 
      bleeding patients. The START-Event registry is a prospective, observational, 
      multicenter, international study. Baseline characteristics (demographic, 
      clinical, risk factors) of patients, laboratory data at admission and during 
      follow-up, site of bleeding, therapeutic strategies, and outcomes at the time of 
      hospital discharge and after 6 months were recorded on a web-based case report 
      form. Between January 2015 and December 2016, 117 patients with major bleeding 
      events were enrolled. Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) was the indication 
      for treatment in 84% (62% males); 53 patients had intracranial bleeding (13 
      fatal), 42 had gastrointestinal bleeding (1 fatal), and 22 had bleeding in other 
      sites. Therapeutic interventions for the management of bleeding were performed in 
      71% of patients. Therapeutic strategies with/without surgery or invasive 
      procedures included: fluid replacement or red blood cells transfusion, 
      prothrombin complex concentrates (3 or 4 factors), antifibrinolytic drugs, and 
      the administration of idarucizumab. Creatinine, blood cell count, and PT/aPTT 
      were the most frequent tests requested, while specific DOAC measurements were 
      performed in 23% of patients. Mortality during hospitalization was 11.9%, at 
      6-month follow-up 15.5%. Our data confirm a high heterogeneity in the management 
      of bleeding complications in patients treated with DOACs.

TI  - In vitro dissolution method fitted to in vivo absorption profile of rivaroxaban 
      immediate-release tablets applying in silico data.
PG  - 723-728
LID - 10.1080/03639045.2017.1411939 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate an in vitro dissolution 
      method based on in silico-in vivo data to determine whether an in vitro-in vivo 
      relationship could be established for rivaroxaban in immediate-release tablets. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Oral drugs with high permeability but poorly soluble in aqueous 
      media, such as the anticoagulant rivaroxaban, have a major potential to reach a 
      high level of in vitro-in vivo relationship. Currently, there is no study on 
      scientific literature approaching the development of RIV dissolution profile 
      based on its in vivo performance. METHODS AND RESULTS: Drug plasma concentration 
      values were modeled using computer simulation with adjustment of pharmacokinetic 
      properties. Those values were converted into drug fractions absorbed by the 
      Wagner-Nelson deconvolution approach. Gradual and continuous dissolution of RIV 
      tablets was obtained with a 30 rpm basket on 50 mM sodium acetate +0.2% SDS, pH 
      6.5 medium. Dissolution was conducted for up to 180 min. The fraction absorbed 
      was plotted against the drug fraction dissolved, and a linear point-to-point 
      regression (R(2) = 0.9961) obtained. CONCLUSION: The in vitro dissolution method 
      designed promoted a more convenient dissolution profile of RIV tablets, whereas 
      it suggests a better relationship with in vivo performance.

AB  - A high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) 
      method allowing the sensitive and specific quantification of rivaroxaban (BAY 
      59-7939), a Factor Xa inhibitor in advanced development for the prevention and 
      treatment of thromboembolic disorders, in human plasma is described. After 
      precipitation of plasma proteins with methanol containing the internal standard 
      followed by centrifugation, the plasma supernatant was injected directly onto the 
      HPLC-MS/MS system. Concentrations could be determined between 0.50 and 500 
      microg/L. Inter-assay precision was < or = 7.4% and inter-assay accuracy was 
      between 96.3 and 102.9% throughout the entire working range. The method was 
      applied successfully in several clinical studies, which allowed an accurate 
      determination of rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics in human plasma.

TI  - Potential Effect of Substituting Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate for 
      Estimated Creatinine Clearance for Dosing of Direct Oral Anticoagulants.
PG  - 1996-2002
LID - 10.1111/jgs.14288 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the potential effect of substituting glomerular 
      filtration rate (GFR) estimates for renal clearance estimated using the 
      Cockcroft-Gault method (CrCL-CG) to calculate direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) 
      dosing. DESIGN: Simulation and retrospective data analysis. SETTING: Community, 
      academic institution, nursing home. PARTICIPANTS: Noninstitutionalized 
      individuals aged 19 to 80 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
      Survey (NHANES) (2011/12) (n = 4,687) and medically stable research participants 
      aged 25 to 105 (n = 208). MEASUREMENTS: Age, height, weight, sex, race, serum 
      creatinine, CrCL-CG, and GFR (according to the Modification of Diet in Renal 
      Disease and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equations). Outcome 
      measures were dosing errors if GFR were to be substituted for CrCL-CG. RESULTS: 
      Renal clearance estimates according to all methods were highly correlated (P < 
      .001), although at lower clearances, substitution of GFR estimates for CrCL-CG 
      resulted in failure to recognize needs for dose reductions of rivaroxaban or 
      edoxaban in 28% of NHANES subjects and 47% to 56% of research subjects. At a 
      CrCL-CG of less than 30 mL/min, GFR estimates missed indicated dosage reductions 
      for dabigatran in 18% to 21% of NHANES subjects and 57% to 86% of research 
      subjects. Age and weight contributed to differences between renal clearance 
      estimates (P < .001), but correction of GFR for body surface area (BSA) did not 
      reduce dosing errors. At a CrCL-CG greater than 95 mL/min, edoxaban is not 
      recommended, and GFR esimates misclassified 24% of NHANES and 39% of research 
      subjects. Correction for BSA reduced misclassification to 7% for NHANES and 14% 
      in research subjects. CONCLUSION: Substitution of GFR estimates for estimated 
      CrCl can lead to failure to recognize indications for reducing DOAC dose and 
      potentially higher bleeding rates than in randomized trials.

TI  - The daily practice of direct oral anticoagulant use in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation; an observational cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are administered in fixed doses 
      without monitoring. There is still little published data on the impact of the 
      absence of monitoring on adherence to medication and stability of DOAC plasma 
      levels over time. OBJECTIVES: To explore adherence and stability of DOAC plasma 
      levels over time in patients with atrial fibrillation (NVAF) recently started on 
      DOAC therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study with 
      structured follow up including assessment of adherence to medication, plasma 
      levels at baseline, 3,6 and 12 months and adverse events. RESULTS: We included 
      164 patients; 89% were previous users of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). One-year 
      adherence was reasonably good: Morisky adherence measurement scores of 6-8 in 
      92%. The majority of DOAC plasma levels were within reported on-therapy ranges; 
      dabigatran (median 104.4 ng/ml, IQR 110.2), rivaroxaban (median 185.2 ng/ml, IQR 
      216.1) and on average levels were not different for full and adjusted doses. 
      There was significant variation between patients, but no significant differences 
      over time within individuals. A substantial proportion of patients starting in 
      the upper-or lower 20th percentiles remained there during the entire follow up. 
      Seventeen bleedings (16 minor, 1 major) were reported, no ischemic events and 
      bleeding or thrombotic events were not associated with DOAC plasma levels. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Adherence was reasonably good in the majority of patients. Our data 
      confirm the stability of DOAC plasma levels over time. Knowledge of such data 
      may, in the individual patient, contribute to optimal drug and dose selection.

TI  - Factor Xa inhibitors--new anticoagulants for secondary haemostasis.
PG  - 260-7
AB  - Oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors are a promising alternative to current 
      anticoagulants. This paper reviews the latest developments of oral direct FXa 
      inhibitors and focuses on those which have been approved for the prevention of 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total hip or knee replacement or are in 
      advanced development and have passed phase II (proof of principle) testing. The 
      most advanced drugs are apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, eribaxaban, rivaroxaban, 
      LY517717, TAK-442, and YM150. Rivaroxaban (Xareltoâ) is the first direct FXa 
      inhibitor which has recently been approved for the prevention of VTE in adult 
      patients after elective hip or knee replacement in several countries, including 
      the European Union and Canada. Rivaroxaban has a flat dose-dependent 
      anticoagulant response with a wide therapeutic window and low potential for 
      drug-drug and drug-food interactions. Rivaroxaban can be given in fixed doses 
      without coagulation monitoring. This review describes the pharmacodynamic and 
      pharmacokinetic profiles and the results of clinical trials with FXa inhibitors 
      in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders.

TI  - Letter to the editor regarding the paper by A. Boileve et al.: Safety of direct 
      oral anticoagulants in patients with advanced solid tumors receiving anti‑VEGF 
      agents: a retrospective study.
PG  - 648
LID - 10.1007/s00520-024-08829-0 [doi]
AB  - Concomitant direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
      targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (anti-VEGF TKI) have been 
      associated with a higher risk of bleeding. Nevertheless, concomitant 
      administration seems frequent in clinical practice in patients with 
      cancer-associated thrombosis and appears to be safe according to the 
      retrospective study by Boileve A. et al. But the risk of an additional 
      pharmacokinetic interaction between anti-VEGF TKI and DOACs must be considered, 
      in case of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition by the TKI. We describe a case report 
      with a major bleeding event in a renal metastatic cancer patient treated with 
      cabozantinib and rivaroxaban. This case highlights the difficult therapeutic 
      decision in a complex patient with cancer-associated thrombosis, who refused the 
      anticoagulant subcutaneous route. Accumulation of bleeding risk factors 
      (genito-urinary tumor localization) was additive to several pharmacodynamic 
      interactions (acetylsalicylic acid, venlafaxine) and a potential pharmacokinetic 
      interaction between cabozantinib and rivaroxaban. Indeed, cabozantinib-related 
      P-glycoprotein inhibition could have led to a supratherapeutic level of 
      rivaroxaban, contributing partly to the bleeding event. Before combining an 
      anti-VEGF TKI and DOACs, a multidisciplinary pretherapeutic assessment seems 
      crucial to evaluate the patient's bleeding risk factors, pharmacodynamic 
      interactions, and the risk of pharmacokinetic interactions mediated by P-gp.

TI  - Safe chest tube placement in a patient with tension pneumothorax receiving 
      rivaroxaban therapy for non-valvular atrial fibrillation.
LID - 10.4081/monaldi.2020.1262 [doi]
AB  - The number of patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants is increasing 
      worldwide. Although bleeding complications associated with direct oral 
      anticoagulants are lower than those associated with vitamin K antagonists, the 
      increased number of patients treated with these anticoagulants suggests that a 
      higher absolute number of patients are at risk. Tube thoracostomy is an invasive 
      procedure with a high risk of bleeding. To date, among direct oral 
      anticoagulants, only dabigatran has a well-studied antidote to reverse its 
      effects during emergency procedure or surgery. This report describes a case in 
      which emergency placement of a tube thoracostomy, in a patient with type 2 
      respiratory failure due to left tension pneumothorax and receiving the 
      anticoagulant rivaroxaban, in the pharmacokinetics phase with greater 
      anticoagulant effect, did not result in bleeding greater than that typically 
      encountered during such interventions. The procedure ended successfully with no 
      acute complications.

AB  - The number of patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation who will be candidates 
      for antithrombotic therapy with direct oral anticoagulants (i.e., dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) is exponentially arising worldwide, thus 
      posing substantial economic and organizational challenges for their urgent 
      monitoring. Due to long turnaround time and inherent technical complexity, liquid 
      chromatography techniques are unsuitable for rapid assessment of their 
      concentration. Even the use of surrogate tests such as thrombin clotting time or 
      anti-factor Xa activity carries some economic and technical drawbacks. Based on 
      literature data, we have hence developed an algorithm based on first-line tests 
      for urgent screening of the anticoagulant effect of direct oral anticoagulants, 
      which entails activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) for dabigatran and 
      prothrombin time (PT) for rivaroxaban. Although these tests also display a 
      concentration-dependent prolongation in patients taking apixaban and edoxaban, 
      neither of them is sufficiently sensitive for providing accurate estimation of 
      the pharmacodynamic effect, so that the measurement of anti-factor Xa activity 
      remains the most suitable approach in patients taking these drugs. According to 
      literature data, this strategy appears suitable to reliably define the thrombotic 
      or bleeding risk in an urgent setting, contextually saving precious laboratory 
      resources.

TI  - Confirmation of model-based dose selection for a Japanese phase III study of

PG  - 321-31
AB  - This study was designed to confirm the appropriateness of the dose setting for a 
      Japanese phase III study of rivaroxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF), which had been based on model simulation employing phase II 
      study data. The previously developed mixed-effects 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model, which consisted of an oral 
      one-compartment model parameterized in terms of clearance, volume and a 
      first-order absorption rate, was rebuilt and optimized using the data for 597 
      subjects from the Japanese phase III study, J-ROCKET AF. A mixed-effects modeling 
      technique in NONMEM was used to quantify both unexplained inter-individual 
      variability and inter-occasion variability, which are random effect parameters. 
      The final PK and PK-PD models were evaluated to identify influential covariates. 
      The empirical Bayes estimates of AUC and C(max) from the final PK model were 
      consistent with the simulated results from the Japanese phase II study. There was 
      no clear relationship between individual estimated exposures and safety-related 
      events, and the estimated exposure levels were consistent with the global phase 
      III data. Therefore, it was concluded that the dose selected for the phase III 
      study with Japanese NVAF patients by means of model simulation employing phase II 
      study data had been appropriate from the PK-PD perspective.

AB  - Patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) may need interruption of treatment 
      before surgery or invasive procedures. Owing to their favorable pharmacokinetics, 
      DOAC could be interrupted for a fixed number of days before surgery or invasive 
      procedures without laboratory testing. However, there are a number of issues that 
      raise concerns about the safety of this strategy. In contrast, laboratory testing 
      prior to surgery or invasive procedures would provide a direct assessment of the 
      residual drug concentration and minimize the risk of bleeding. This forum is 
      aimed at discussing the pros and cons of the two strategies and fostering 
      discussion on this important issue. Overall, the laboratory strategy appears 
      superior in terms of patient safety and should be considered in patients 
      undergoing surgical or invasive procedures.

AB  - Compared to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA), novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) appear 
      to be safer in terms of major bleeding risks with added advantage of having fixed 
      dosing schedules when used in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation 
      (AF). We sought to study the differences as sources and severity of 
      anticoagulant-associated haemorrhage in patients with AF in the year preceding 
      introduction of NOACs (first cohort) as compared to post approval of the NOACs 
      (second cohort) by retrospectively reviewing the hospital admissions, as well as 
      the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions between time periods. There 
      were 359 patients for the first cohort and 405 patients for the second cohort, 
      including 57 patients prescribed NOACs. There was no significant difference in 
      age, deaths, source of bleeding, or rate of pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic 
      interaction between the two time periods. Comparing all VKA patients to patients 
      prescribed NOAC's, there were non-significant but higher rates of intracerebral 
      bleed, significantly higher rates of pharmacokinetic (194 (25.4%) versus 0 (0%), 
      p<.001) and similar rates of pharmacodynamic interactions (505 (66.1%) versus 39 
      (68.4%), p=.70). Drug-renal interactions were seen in 7 of the 57 (12.3%) 
      NOAC-treated patients, in which all seven had acute renal failure that may have 
      prolonged the effects of the anticoagulants. NOACs hold promise in that drug 
      interactions are far less common than those seen in VKAs, and intracerebral 
      bleeds appear to be less common in randomised trials as well as our review. For 
      patients on dabigatran or rivaroxaban, consideration should be given to serial 
      monitoring of renal function.

TI  - Rivaroxaban, an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor: a new option for 
      thromboprophylaxis.
PG  - e932-8;discussion e939
LID - 10.3928/01477447-20120525-38 [doi]
AB  - Patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, including total hip arthroplasty 
      (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA), are at high risk for developing venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE). Although largely a preventable complication, VTE develops 
      in a significant proportion of patients, highlighting the need for improved 
      methods of VTE prevention. Current thromboprophylactic options are limited by 
      unpredictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (vitamin K antagonists), 
      parenteral/subcutaneous administration (heparin and low-molecular-weight 
      heparins), complicated dosing, and increased risk of bleeding.Rivaroxaban is an 
      oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor that has recently received marketing 
      authorization in the United States for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis in 
      patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. The clinical pharmacology of 
      rivaroxaban supports a convenient, oral, once-daily dosing regimen without the 
      need for routine coagulation monitoring after THA or TKA. A comprehensive phase 
      II and III study program supports its safety and efficacy for VTE prevention 
      after THA or TKA. Phase III results have demonstrated the superior efficacy of 
      rivaroxaban regimens compared with enoxaparin regimens, with similar rates of 
      major bleeding. This article provides an overview of the phase II and III results 
      that support the use of this agent for the prevention of VTE after elective total 
      hip or knee replacement.

TI  - [Rivaroxaban (Xarelto): new anticoagulant inhibitor of factor Xa].
PG  - 538-43
AB  - (Xarelto, Bayer Schering Pharma) is a new anticoagulant with a good oral 
      bioavailability, acting as a potent, selective direct inhibitor of factor Xa. It 
      is indicated in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in adult patients after 
      total hip replacement or total knee replacement surgery. In four large clinical 
      trials (RECORD), oral rivaroxaban was more effective than subcutaneous enoxaparin 
      in preventing postoperative venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing such 
      surgery, and this superior efficacy was achieved without significant increase in 
      the incidence of major bleeding episodes. Rivaroxaban offers several advantages 
      as compared with low-molecular-weight heparin preparations and oral coumarinic 
      agents. Its use is easy with only one 10 mg tablet per day and does not require 
      coagulation blood monitoring or dose adjustment. This promising new anticoagulant 
      is currently evaluated in several clinical trials testing other potential 
      indications, among which acute coronary syndrome and atrial fibrillation.

AB  - Goal of this article is to select three molecules from all the candidates 
      currently under clincial development and to present and comapre their 
      characteristics. Dabigatran is a direct thrombin (FIIa) inhibitor, whereas 
      Rivaroxaban and Apixaban are direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors. All three 
      represent small molecules thatreversibly, rapidly and directly bind to their 
      target, the active center of the respective activated coagulation factor. Phase 
      III data have been published for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis for each of 
      these three drugs. Interestingly, VTE prophylaxis is initiated postoperatively 
      with these products. Rivaroxaban currently holds the only accepted indication in 
      Switzerland. For the indications VTE, atrial fibrillation and acute coronary 
      syndrome promising phase III data have been or are in the process of being 
      published. Monitoring is not necessary for any of these three new anticoagulants.

      anticoagulant.
PG  - 477-84
LID - 10.1007/s11739-013-0963-5 [doi]
AB  - The use of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is increasing since these drugs are 
      at least as efficacious and safe as vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for the 
      management of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and venous 
      thromboembolism. Compared with VKAs, NOACs have a faster onset and offset of 
      action, a predictable and consistent pharmacokinetic profile, fewer drug 
      interactions, and ease of use since anticoagulant monitoring is not required. 
      Current perioperative management will be affected by these characteristics, with 
      the potential to obviate the need for heparin bridging. This review aims to 
      summarize the current evidence of perioperative thromboembolic and bleeding risk 
      during anticoagulant interruption, which is derived predominantly from patients 
      receiving VKA therapy, and early studies involving NOACs which mainly focus on 
      patients who are receiving dabigatran. The role of heparin bridging is discussed. 
      We also provide a practical approach for the perioperative management of patients 
      who are receiving NOAC therapy.

TI  - Discovery of the novel antithrombotic agent 5-chloro-N-({(5S)-2-oxo-3- 
      [4-(3-oxomorpholin-4-yl)phenyl]-1,3-oxazolidin-5-yl}methyl)thiophene- 
      2-carboxamide (BAY 59-7939): an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor.
PG  - 5900-8
AB  - Despite recent progress in antithrombotic therapy, there is still an unmet 
      medical need for safe and orally available anticoagulants. The coagulation enzyme 
      Factor Xa (FXa) is a particularly promising target, and recent efforts in this 
      field have focused on the identification of small-molecule inhibitors with good 
      oral bioavailability. We identified oxazolidinone derivatives as a new class of 
      potent FXa inhibitors. Lead optimization led to the discovery of BAY 59-7939 (5), 
      a highly potent and selective, direct FXa inhibitor with excellent in vivo 
      antithrombotic activity. The X-ray crystal structure of 5 in complex with human 
      FXa clarified the binding mode and the stringent requirements for high affinity. 
      The interaction of the neutral ligand chlorothiophene in the S1 subsite allows 
      for the combination of good oral bioavailability and high potency for nonbasic 5. 
      Compound 5 is currently under clinical development for the prevention and 
      treatment of thromboembolic diseases.

AB  - Amongst numerous promising anticoagulant molecules, rivaroxaban (Xarelto(®)), 
      dabigatran (Pradaxa(®)) and apixaban (Eliquis(®)) have been registered outside 
      the USA in the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients undergoing total 
      hip or knee prosthetic replacement. Rivaroxaban however has been granted 
      authorisation by the FDA for the thromboprophylaxis after surgery for total hip 
      or knee surgery. Dabigatran has been granted authorisation by the FDA in 
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (RE-LY trial) while rivaroxaban is expecting 
      approval in this same indication (ROCKET trial). Phase III results in the 
      treatment and in the secondary prevention of established venous thrombosis and 
      pulmonary embolism are encouraging. These small molecules are obtained by 
      chemical synthesis, their molecular weight is lower than 500 daltons. Many 
      coagulation tests may be affected by these molecules. Those modifications should 
      be known in order to avoid misinterpretation of the tests but could also be used 
      to measure plasma concentrations of these products. The choice of a non specific 
      global and readily available test has been documented (Quick time for rivaroxaban 
      and aPTT for dabigatran). Anti-Xa (for rivaroxaban) and anti-IIa (for dabigatran) 
      activities should however be preferred, expressed in ng/ml with calibrated 
      plasmas (containing predetermined concentration of the tested drug). The 
      half-life is around 8 to 12 hours, with a peak activity 2 to 4 hours after 
      ingestion. Dabigatran is mainly eliminated via the kidney, hence requiring 
      dose-adjustment in case of moderate renal insufficiency, and contra-indicated in 
      case of severe renal insufficiency. Rivaroxaban being excreted via kidney and 
      liver, some precautions should apply in case of liver insufficiency. No data are 
      available in pregnancy or pediatrics, clinical trials are ongoing. There are few 
      interactions with concomitant drugs, which should not be ignored. The short 
      half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote 
      in many instances. Their oral administration, without the need for dose 
      adjustment, and without requirement for a laboratory monitoring will increase 
      their use in a large number of patients, in those indications for which an 
      approval has been granted by health authorities.

TI  - Prevalence of drug-related problems associated with direct oral anticoagulants in 
      hospitalized patients: a multicenter, cross-sectional study.
PG  - 58-63
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.12473 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The complex dose regimens of the direct-acting oral 
      anticoagulants (DOAC) make their appropriate prescribing highly challenging. 
      Inappropriate prescribing of the DOAC remains poorly addressed. We studied the 
      patterns of DOAC prescription and estimated the prevalence of drug-related 
      problems (DRPs) associated with their use. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was 
      conducted using data from medical records system of the Lyon teaching hospitals. 
      DRPs, identified among patients who received a DOAC, between 1 January 2010 and 
      31 July 2013, were categorized according to the Pharmaceutical Care Network 
      Europe Classification System. The prevalence of hospital stays with a DRP was 
      estimated, and a subgroup analysis according to DOAC and their indication for use 
      was provided. Clinical outcomes were not assessed. RESULTS: Of the 4154 hospital 
      stays with at least one DOAC administration [3412 patients; median age (range): 
      71 years (14-98), 57% female], 70·8% were excluded from the analysis mainly due 
      to missing information for renal function and/or patient weight. Of the 1188 
      hospital stays that were screened, 100 DRPs were identified (prevalence 8·4%; 95% 
      CI, 6·8-10·0). The highest prevalence was found among patients who received 
      rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation (14·6%; 95% CI, 10·7-18·5). A too low drug 
      dose was the most frequent DRP (n = 56; 4·7%), followed by a too high drug dose 
      (n = 37; 3·1%), contraindication (n = 5; 0·4%), and pharmacokinetic problem 
      requiring dose adjustment (n = 2; 0·2%). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Drug-related 
      problems associated with the DOACs occur quite commonly among hospitalized 
      patients. Although these DRPs were considered to be of minor severity, 
      prescribing protocols to support better prescribing should be disseminated to 
      reduce the risk to patients. Renal function and body weight data should be 
      mandatory on prescriptions to allow cross-checking.

AB  - AIM: To define the role of thrombophilic and other procoagulant conditions in 
      pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis and the effectiveness of pathogenetic 
      secondary prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic events. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: The study included 107 patients for the period 2007-2016 who were 
      divided into 3 groups. The main group (n=40) - lifelong individual antithrombotic 
      therapy with warfarin predominantly; the second (control) group (n=39) - warfarin 
      administration for 3-6 months; the third (additional) group (n=28) - specific 
      life-long therapy depending on procoagulant status which was assessed according 
      to original scale. The main anticoagulants were rivoroxaban or dabigatran 
      etexilate. Recurrent venous thromboembolic complications (RVTE) were observed in 
      one (2.5%) patient of the first group and in 8 (20.5%) cases of the second group. 
      In the third group RVTE were absent (significant differences, p<0.03 and 0.001, 
      respectively). Arterial thromboembolic diseases were noted in 1 (2.5%) patient of 
      the first group, in 4 (10.25%) cases of the second group and in none of the third 
      group (significantly only for group II vs. group III, p<0.01). RESULTS: 
      Individual antithrombotic therapy reduces the incidence of recurrent venous and 
      arterial thromboembolic events in patients with idiopathic deep vein thrombosis.

TI  - [Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in orthopaedic surgery--trivial option, 
      huge potential].
PG  - 26-30
LID - 10.1055/s-0029-1186018 [doi]
AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common, sometimes even fatal though preventable 
      complication after surgical interventions, especially in orthopaedic surgery. The 
      risk can be reduced by more than 50 % by mechanical means and different 
      anticoagulant drugs. However, only few patients receive adequate treatment. 
      Medicamentous options are limited and somewhat difficult. Most anticoagulant 
      substances act indirectly, therefore their efficacy can easily be impaired. For 
      some, the pharmacokinetics are quite unfavourable. Furthermore, these drugs can 
      cause severe adverse reactions; and since drug therapy either needs daily 
      injections or routine blood checks, its acceptance is limited even further. 
      Fortunately, new substances have reached phase III and will shortly be released. 
      They have a broad therapeutic index, favourable pharmacodynamics and -kinetics 
      and seem to cause only few adverse events. Rivaroxaban, for example, is approved 
      for orthopaedic interventions like total hip or knee replacement. Orally 
      administered, it interacts directly with factor Xa. It proved to be superior 
      compared to the standard therapy with Enoxaparin, has a similar risk profile and 
      needs no routine blood checks. The following article gives a critical survey of 
      the problem, therapeutic options, current guidelines and new possibilities. 
      Hopefully, these new simplified therapy options will increase the acceptance of 
      VTE prophylaxis so that the rate of fatal complications after orthopaedic 
      interventions can further be reduced.

AB  - The thematic review presents modern solutions using oral anticoagulants with a 
      focus on direct coagulation factor X inhibitors. It contains information about 
      the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of apixaban and rivaroxaban against the 
      background of different drug intake regimens - twice and once per day. There are 
      shown studies of concentration dynamics and the corresponding functional 
      response, measured using the integral method - the thrombin generation test, 
      which is widely used in scientific research to describe hemostatic processes 
      based on an objective quantitative assessment of the thrombin formation - a key 
      coagulation cascade serine protease. The logical relationship between the 
      pharmacodynamics of anticoagulant action and the clinical presentation of the 
      effectiveness and safety of drugs is traced. The review provides links to actual 
      literature and current clinical guidelines.

TI  - Bleeding with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban. No antidote, and little clinical 
      experience.
PG  - 155-9
AB  - Dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban are oral anticoagulants used to prevent or 
      treat thrombosis in a variety of situations. Like all anticoagulants, these drugs 
      can provoke bleeding. How should patients be managed if bleeding occurs during 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban therapy? How can the risk of bleeding be 
      reduced in patients who require surgery or other invasive procedures? To answer 
      these questions, we reviewed the available literature, using the standard 
      Prescrire methodology. In clinical trials, warfarin, enoxaparin, dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban were associated with a similar frequency of severe 
      bleeding. Numerous reports of severe bleeding associated with dabigatran have 
      been recorded since this drug was first marketed. Some situations are associated 
      with a particularly high bleeding risk, including: even mild renal failure, 
      advanced age, extremes in body weight and drug-drug interactions, particularly 
      with antiplatelet agents (including aspirin), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory 
      drugs, and many drugs used in cardiovascular indications. In patients treated 
      with dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban, changes in the INR (international 
      normalised ratio) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) do not 
      correlate with the dose. In early 2013, there is still no routine coagulation 
      test suitable for monitoring these patients; specific tests are only available in 
      specialised laboratories. In early 2013 there is no antidote for dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban or apixaban, nor any specific treatment with proven efficacy for 
      severe bleeding linked to these drugs. Recommendations on the management of 
      bleeding in this setting are based mainly on pharmacological parameters and on 
      scarce experimen-Haemodialysis reduces the plasma concentration of dabigatran, 
      while rivaroxaban and apixaban cannot be eliminated by dialysis. Prothrombin 
      complex concentrates and recombinant activated factor VII seem to have little or 
      no efficacy, and they carry a poorly documented risk of thrombosis. For patients 
      undergoing surgery or other invasive procedures, clinical practice guidelines are 
      primarily based on pharmacokinetic parameters and on extrapolation of data on 
      vitamin K antagonists. The decision on whether or not to discontinue 
      anticoagulation before the procedure mainly depends on the likely risk of 
      bleeding. In patients at high risk of thrombosis, heparin can be proposed when 
      the anticoagulant is withdrawn. In early 2013, difficulties in the management of 
      bleeding and of situations in which there is a risk of bleeding weigh heavily in 
      the balance of potential harm versus potential benefit of dabigatran, rivaroxaban 
      and apixaban. When an oral anticoagulant is required, it is best to choose 
      warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, and the drug with which we have the most 
      experience, except in those rare situations in which the INR cannot be maintained 
      within the therapeutic range.

AB  - Data on the impact of morbid obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 40 kg/m(2)) on the 
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) of direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) are relatively limited, making it difficult to design optimal dosing 
      regimens in morbidly obese patients.To review literature on PK/PD profile, 
      efficacy, and safety of DOACs in venous thromboembolism (VTE) and nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with morbid obesity and make recommendations 
      regarding optimal dosing regimens in these patient populations.A detailed 
      literature search was conducted (from inception to June 22, 2022) for relevant 
      articles involving PK/PD and clinical data on DOACs use in morbidly obese 
      patients with VTE or AF, or healthy volunteers.A total of 28 studies were 
      identified. DOAC-specific PK variations and clinical outcomes have been observed. 
      Obesity may have a modest effect on PK/PD of dabigatran, apixaban, or 
      rivaroxaban. Dabigatran was effective in AF patients with morbid obesity but 
      might increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Standard dosing of apixaban 
      or rivaroxaban is effective and safe for VTE and AF patients with morbid obesity. 
      Trough edoxaban concentration and anti-Xa activity were similar in different BMI 
      groups (18.5 to >40 kg/m(2)), and standard dosing of edoxaban may be effective 
      and safe for AF patients.Current evidence suggests dabigatran should be used with 
      caution in patients with AF as it might increase the risk of gastrointestinal 
      bleeding; Standard dosing of apixaban or rivaroxaban can be used in VTE or AF 
      patients; Standard dosing of edoxaban may be considered in AF patients.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in patients with 
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation: results from ROCKET AF.
PG  - 917-27
LID - 10.1002/jcph.288 [doi]
AB  - Two once-daily rivaroxaban dosing regimens were compared with warfarin for stroke 
      prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in ROCKET AF: 20 mg 
      for patients with normal/mildly impaired renal function and 15 mg for patients 
      with moderate renal impairment. Rivaroxaban population pharmacokinetic 
      (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling data from ROCKET AF patients (n = 161) are 
      reported and are used to confirm established rivaroxaban PK and PK/PD models and 
      to re-estimate values of the models' parameters for the current AF population. An 
      oral one-compartment model with first-order absorption adequately described 
      rivaroxaban PK. Age, renal function, and lean body mass influenced the PK model. 
      Prothrombin time and prothrombinase-induced clotting time exhibited a near-linear 
      relationship with rivaroxaban plasma concentration; inhibitory effects were 
      observed through to 24 hours post-dose. Rivaroxaban plasma concentration and 
      factor Xa activity had an inhibitory maximum-effect (Emax ) relationship. Renal 
      function (on prothrombin time; prothrombinase-induced clotting time) and age (on 
      factor Xa activity) had moderate effects on PK/PD models. PK and PK/PD models 
      were shown to be adequate for describing the current dataset. These findings 
      confirm the modeling and empirical results that led to the selection of doses 
      tested against warfarin in ROCKET AF.

TI  - Oral factor Xa inhibitors for the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 312-20
LID - 10.1097/HCO.0b013e32833a524f [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Prevention of stroke and systemic emboli is paramount in the 
      management of atrial fibrillation. Although warfarin is the predominant 
      anticoagulant used in patients with atrial fibrillation, it has significant 
      limitations that have impeded appropriate use of stroke prophylaxis in eligible 
      patients with atrial fibrillation. Consequently, much research has been focused 
      on finding an alternative to warfarin. We review the potential alternatives in 
      development and evaluate the current evidence concerning their safety and 
      efficacy. RECENT FINDINGS: Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors are potentially well 
      tolerated and effective replacements for warfarin. These agents do not require 
      cofactors and offer selective inhibition at a critical step of amplification in 
      the coagulation cascade. Multiple direct anti-factor Xa agents are currently 
      undergoing evaluation in phase I, II, and III trials. Early results suggest that 
      these novel anticoagulants have favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      profiles with minimal-to-no requirements for therapeutic monitoring. Two direct 
      factor Xa inhibitors are emerging from phase II trials (betrixaban and YM150) and 
      three are being evaluated in phase III trials (apixaban, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban) for the prevention of stroke and systemic emboli in patients with 
      atrial fibrillation. The phase III trials of apixaban and rivaroxaban have 
      completed enrollment and are in the follow-up phase. SUMMARY: Given the growing 
      population of patients with atrial fibrillation, there is a great interest in 
      finding new therapies for oral anticoagulation. The direct factor Xa inhibitors 
      may offer several promising alternatives to warfarin therapy.

TI  - Thrombotic and bleeding outcomes following perioperative interruption of direct 
      oral anticoagulants in patients with venous thromboembolic disease.
PG  - 925-930
LID - 10.1111/jth.13670 [doi]
AB  - Essentials Studies evaluating the procedural interruption of direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) are lacking. We conducted a study of the interruption of 
      DOACs for prior venous thromboembolic disease (VTE). The post-operative risks of 
      recurrent VTE and major bleeding are low in this patient population. A scheme 
      based on half-life and procedure-related bleeding appears safe and efficacious. 
      SUMMARY: Background Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly being 
      used in the setting of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE). There is little 
      evidence to guide the peri-procedural interruption of DOACs in this patient 
      population. A number of studies have evaluated the perioperative interruption of 
      DOACs based on half-life of the anticoagulant and the underlying procedural 
      bleeding risk in patient with atrial fibrillation, but it remains unclear whether 
      these findings can be extended to patients with VTE. Objective Evaluate 
      thrombotic and bleeding outcomes following the perioperative interruption of 
      direct oral anticoagulation in patients with prior VTE. Methods We conducted a 
      retrospective analysis of consecutive patients on a DOAC for prior VTE requiring 
      temporary interruption of anticoagulation for an invasive procedure. The primary 
      efficacy outcome was the 30-day symptomatic VTE rate, and the primary safety 
      outcome was the 30-day major bleeding rate. Secondary outcomes included overall 
      mortality and the rate of clinically relevant non-major bleeding. Results A total 
      of 190 patients were included in the analysis. The 30-day VTE rate was 1.05% (95% 
      CI, 0.29-3.8%) and the 30-day major bleeding rate was 0.53% (95% CI, 0.09-2.93%). 
      There were no deaths during the 30-day follow-up period. The rate of clinically 
      relevant non-major bleeding was 3.16% (95%CI , 1.46-6.72%). Conclusions The 
      perioperative interruption of DOACs in the setting of VTE, using a strategy that 
      considers the half-life of the DOAC and the underlying procedural bleeding risk, 
      appears to be both safe and effective.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Arterial and venous thrombotic states, including myocardial 
      infarction (MI), stroke and deep vein thrombosis with subsequent pulmonary 
      embolism, are a significant cause of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. 
      Factor Xa (FXa) plays a pivotal role in thrombus formation. Its inhibition 
      following acute coronary syndromes (ACS) blocks amplification of thrombin 
      generation and subsequent clot formation, resulting in a risk reduction in 
      recurrent MI, stroke and death. For this reason, a predictable form of oral 
      anticoagulation continues to be an ongoing need. Rivaroxaban , the first oral FXa 
      inhibitor, acts by direct inhibition of FXa and does not require an antithrombin 
      cofactor for its activity. AREAS COVERED: This paper describes the 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of low-dose rivaroxaban tested in patients with ACS. Age, 
      gender, renal function and body weight have no clinically significant effects on 
      the PK of the drug in treatment of ACS. Caution should be maintained during 
      co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors. Among patients with 
      moderate and severe hepatic impairment and in those with associated 
      coagulopathies, rivaroxaban however is contraindicated. EXPERT OPINION: The 
      mortality benefit with low-dose rivaroxaban in ACS patients was first 
      demonstrated in ATLAS ACS2 TIMI-51 trial. With its rapid oral bioavailability, 
      predictable PK, low drug-drug interaction and no need for monitoring, the use of 
      low-dose rivaroxaban in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy offers an appealing 
      new option in improving outcomes following ACS in the modern era of novel oral 
      FXa inhibitors.

TI  - Perioperative management of patients on new oral anticoagulants.
PG  - 742-9
LID - 10.1002/bjs.9485 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: New oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer an alternative to warfarin for 
      preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. NOACs are expected to 
      replace warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists for most of their indications in 
      the future. Knowledge of the use of NOACs in the perioperative period is 
      important for optimal care. METHODS: Studies that reported on the use of NOACs 
      were identified, focusing on evidence-based guidance relating to the 
      perioperative period. PubMed was searched for relevant articles published between 
      January 2000 and January 2014. RESULTS: The anticipated expanded clinical use of 
      NOACs such as rivaroxaban (Xarelto™), apixaban (Eliquis™) and dabigatran 
      (Pradaxa™) has the potential to simplify perioperative anticoagulant management 
      because of fewer drug-drug interactions, rapid onset of action, predictable 
      pharmacokinetics and relatively short half-lives. However, coagulation status 
      cannot be monitored by international normalized ratio and no antidotes are 
      currently available. In elective surgery, it is important to discontinue the use 
      of NOACs, with special consideration of renal function as route of elimination. 
      Guidelines for the management of bleeding complications in patients on NOACs are 
      provided, and may be considered for trauma and emergency surgery. Haemodialysis 
      could be considered for bleeding with use of dabigatran. Better options for 
      reversal of the effects of NOACs when bleeding occurs may follow with novel 
      drugs. CONCLUSION: Management of NOACs in elective and emergency conditions 
      requires knowledge of time of last intake of drug, current renal function and the 
      planned procedure in order to assess the overall risk of bleeding. Currently no 
      antidote exists to reverse the effects of these drugs.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) represent the cornerstone therapy for 
      cardioembolic events prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation 
      (NVAF). In practice, the choice of one DOAC over another is guided by the 
      decision-making process of the physician, which considers specific patient and 
      drug characteristics. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical features and 
      long-term outcomes of a real-world population treated with DOACs, where the use 
      of the 4 different DOACs is quite equal. We conducted a retrospective 
      observational, single-center, multidisciplinary study enrolling consecutive NVAF 
      patients treated with one of the 4 DOACs. From an initial number of 753 patients, 
      we excluded 72 patients because of loss to follow-up, at the end we enrolled 
      681:174 (23%) treated with dabigatran, 175 (23%) with apixaban, 190 (25%) with 
      rivaroxaban, and 214 (29%) with edoxaban. Patients treated with apixaban were 
      significantly older, more women represented (p <0.001), and with a higher 
      cardioembolic and bleeding risk (p <0.001). Dabigatran was preferred in patients 
      with liver failure (p = 0.008), whereas Apixaban and Edoxaban were chosen in 
      chronic kidney disease (p = 0.002). At 3-year follow-up, 20 patients (2.7%) 
      experienced a systemic thromboembolic event without significant differences in 
      the 4 DOACs. In the same period, an International Society of Thrombosis and 
      Hemostasis classification major bleeding event occurred in 26 patients (3.6%), 
      more statistically correlated to edoxaban (6.1%) (p = 0.038). Thromboembolic 
      events or major bleeding were higher in the edoxaban group (10%) compared with 
      the others (p = 0.014). In our single-center real-world experience, the choice of 
      the DOAC for a patient with NVAF was tailored to specific clinical features and 
      drug pharmacokinetics of the patient. As a result, a small number of adverse 
      events were observed.

AB  - Decisions surrounding periprocedural anticoagulation management must balance 
      thromboembolic and procedural bleed risk. The interruption of both warfarin and 
      DOACs requires consideration of anticoagulant pharmacokinetics, procedural bleed 
      risk and patient characteristics. There is a diminishing role for periprocedural 
      bridging LMWH overall and no role for bridging LMWH for the procedural 
      interruption of DOACs. A clinical approach to perioperative DOAC management based 
      on operative bleeding risk and renal function is safe and effective, and at 
      present, is preferred over preprocedural DOAC levels testing. Clear communication 
      of the anticoagulation interruption plan to both the patient and the patient's 
      care team is essential.

TI  - Role of P-glycoprotein in the uptake/efflux transport of oral vitamin K 
      antagonists and rivaroxaban through the Caco-2 cell model.
PG  - 259-65
LID - 10.1111/bcpt.12084 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are prescribed worldwide and remain the oral 
      anticoagulant of choice. These drugs are characterized by a narrow therapeutic 
      index and a large inter- and intra-individual variability. P-glycoprotein could 
      contribute to this variability. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      involvement of P-gp in the transport of acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon and warfarin 
      using an in vitro Caco-2 cell monolayer model. These results were compared with 
      those obtained with rivaroxaban, a new oral anticoagulant known to be a P-gp 
      substrate. The transport of these four drugs was assessed at pH conditions 
      6.8/7.4 in the presence or absence of the P-gp inhibitor cyclosporine A (10 μM) 
      and the more potent and specific P-gp inhibitor valspodar (5 μM). Analytical 
      quantification was performed by LC/MS. With an efflux ratio of 1.7 and a 
      significant decrease in the efflux (Papp B-A), in the presence of P-gp inhibitors 
      at a concentration of 50 μM, acenocoumarol can be considered as a weak P-gp 
      substrate. Concerning phenprocoumon, the results suggest that this molecule is a 
      poor P-gp substrate. The P-gp inhibitors did not affect significantly the 
      transport of warfarin. The efflux of rivaroxaban was strongly inhibited by the 
      two P-gp inhibitors. In conclusion, none of the three VKAs tested are strong P-gp 
      substrates. However, acenocoumarol can be considered as a weak P-gp substrate and 
      phenprocoumon as a poor P-gp substrate.

TI  - Rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939)--an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor--has no clinically 
      relevant interaction with naproxen.
PG  - 469-76
AB  - AIMS: Rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) is in advanced clinical development for the 
      prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. Frequent co-medications in 
      the patient populations likely to receive rivaroxaban include NSAIDs. This 
      randomized, two-way crossover study, with a naproxen run-in period, was performed 
      to determine whether naproxen influences the tolerability, pharmacodynamics and 
      pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. METHODS: Eleven healthy, young males received 
      naproxen 500 mg on two consecutive days, a single dose of rivaroxaban 15 mg, or 
      both. RESULTS: Treatments were well tolerated: adverse events (eight in total), 
      reported by three subjects, were mild and not drug related. Rivaroxaban inhibited 
      Factor Xa activity by 35% and prolonged prothrombin time [by 1.4 times baseline 
      (tb)], activated partial thromboplastin time (1.3 tb) and the HepTest (1.9 tb). 
      Naproxen had no influence on these measures and the combination of rivaroxaban 
      and naproxen did not affect platelet aggregation. Rivaroxaban and naproxen given 
      together significantly increased bleeding time compared with rivaroxaban alone (P 
      = 0.017). However, this difference was small compared with the effect of naproxen 
      given alone, except in one subject. Least squares-means ratios for the AUC and 
      C(max) of rivaroxaban after administration alone and with naproxen were 1.125 
      [90% confidence interval (CI) 0.995, 1.271] and 1.095 (90% CI 0.905, 1.325), 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There appeared to be no clinically relevant 
      interaction between rivaroxaban and naproxen in healthy subjects, although some 
      individuals may be more sensitive to the combination. Large-scale Phase III 
      clinical studies will be required to confirm whether there is an increased risk 
      of bleeding during treatment with rivaroxaban and concomitant NSAIDs.

AB  - New oral anticoagulants are ready to enter the scene on a massive basis for the 
      treatment/prophylaxis of many cardiovascular diseases. Although they can be 
      prescribed without dose-adjustment based on laboratory testing, the laboratory is 
      still an essential partner that may assist clinicians for the management of 
      anticoagulated patients. In principle, there are many tests that can be used to 
      evaluate the anticoagulant effect of the new drugs, but the choice should be made 
      among those that are more readily available in emergency and that are easy to 
      run. Linearity of dose-response and responsiveness to increasing dose in addition 
      to standardization are other important issues to consider. This article is aimed 
      at reviewing the current tests, their characteristics and the most appropriate 
      choice.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban after bariatric surgery: a case report.
PG  - 533-5
LID - 10.1007/s11239-013-0891-2 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor, which is rapidly absorbed in the 
      upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In large trials, it has been shown to be 
      effective and safe in VTE treatment. However, in these trials patients with 
      morbid obesity were not reported and it is unknown if the standard dosage of 20 
      mg rivaroxaban is sufficient for bariatric patients, especially after bariatric 
      surgery, which may impact the resorption of rivaroxaban. We report the case of a 
      bariatric patient with high venous thromboembolism risk and instable INR after 
      recent bariatric surgery, who was switched from Vitamin-K antagonists to 
      rivaroxaban. After intake of 20 mg rivaroxaban, plasma concentration were 
      repeatedly measured until 3 h after the second dose using a commercially 
      available chromogenic aXa-assay. Furthermore, INR and aPTT were measured. Peak 
      concentrations of 224.22 ng/ml were observed. After 6 h, plasma concentration 
      decreased to 86.9 ng/ml and remained stable until 12 h (86.32 ng/ml). After 24 h, 
      a trough level of 35.54 ng/ml was observed. The patients INR did immediately 
      increase and remained significantly elevated throughout the day with a slow 
      decrease. Since peak values of rivaroxaban plasma concentrations were in the 
      expected range of published data, we conclude that resorption of rivaroxaban was 
      immediate and not significantly impaired by bariatric surgery of the upper GI 
      tract. Consequently, no dose adjustments seem to be necessary in this high-risk 
      population.

TI  - Comparison of the phase III clinical trial designs of novel oral anticoagulants 
      versus warfarin for the treatment of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: 
      implications for clinical practice.
PG  - 111-27
LID - 10.1007/s40256-013-0062-z [doi]
AB  - Although vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been the backbone of 
      thromboprophylaxis in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, their limitations have 
      encouraged the development of a new generation of oral anticoagulants. This 
      review compares the different designs and procedures used to conduct four phase 
      III trials that tested dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban versus 
      VKAs. Although pharmacologic characteristics and results of the main trials are 
      briefly discussed, this review mainly focuses on study designs, enrollment 
      criteria, populations studied, quality metrics, and transition strategies between 
      oral anticoagulants. While each of the trials was of high quality, performed 
      independently, and led by independent academic groups, substantial differences 
      exist in terms of drug pharmacology and trial characteristics. Caution is advised 
      when comparing results across trials as practicing clinicians strive to 
      personalize anticoagulation treatments for their individual patients. We believe 
      that the differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the 
      available novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), coupled with substantial 
      heterogeneity in the trial populations and designs and procedures used to conduct 
      the trials, support an important role for each of the NOACs dependent upon the 
      specific clinical scenario faced by the practicing clinician.

AB  - The new anticoagulants (NOACs) tested for prevention or treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE), stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF), and acute 
      coronary syndromes (ACS) differ in bioavailability, metabolism, route of 
      excretion and interaction with other drugs, but have remarkably similar 
      pharmacokinetics, with very similar half lives. However the choice of dosing 
      regimens in different clinical conditions has been different for the various 
      NOACs, and has been established on the basis of widely different considerations, 
      including the clinical setting (venous versus arterial thrombosis), the 
      indications (prophylaxis versus treatment), the likelihood of concomitant 
      antiplatelet drugs, and marketing opportunities; these latter were based on the 
      knowledge that patients' compliance is generally better with once daily than with 
      twice daily dosing. Current prevailing wisdom is that peak plasma drug 
      concentrations are important determinants of bleeding: since a fractioning of the 
      total daily dose into a twice daily regimen reduces peak plasma drug 
      concentrations compared with once daily dosing, this should maximize safety. 
      However, recent pharmacokinetic analyses of a phase II study with edoxaban in AF 
      found that bleeding, with the same daily dosing, was less frequent with once 
      daily dosing than with twice daily dosing, and correlated - better than other 
      pharmacokinetic parameters - through drug concentrations. Higher rates of 
      bleeding have been also reported with the twice daily versus once daily dosing of 
      darexaban in a phase II study in ACS. These results may lead to a rethinking on 
      the pathophysiology of bleeding in the setting of anticoagulation.

TI  - The new oral anticoagulants: a challenge for hospital formularies.
PG  - 126-8
LID - 10.3810/hp.2012.08.996 [doi]
AB  - Introduction Over the past 60 years, clinicians have used vitamin K antagonists, 
      primarily warfarin, as the sole oral anticoagulants for managing a variety of 
      thrombotic disorders. Warfarin, which requires frequent monitoring, has a 
      variable dose response, a narrow therapeutic index, and numerous drug and dietary 
      interactions. However, intravenous and subcutaneous agents, such as 
      unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, 
      and pentasaccharide, have been introduced over the past 30 years for managing 
      thromboembolic disorders. Recently, 5 new oral anticoagulants, dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban, have been introduced into 
      clinical trials. Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific 
      direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor IIa. These drugs 
      have a pharmacological profile that does not require monitoring in order to 
      adjust therapy, which is the mainstay of warfarin management. In addition, these 
      new medications have not shown any major issues regarding food interactions; 
      rather, they demonstrate the potential for limited drug-drug interactions due to 
      their limited metabolism through the cytochrome P450 system. This unique 
      pharmacokinetic profile may provide clinicians with a new era of managing 
      thromboembolic disorders. Two of these agents, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, have 
      been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke prevention 
      in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF); in addition, rivaroxaban 
      can be used in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in total hip and 
      knee arthroplasty during the acute and extended periods of risk. However, the 
      challenge for hospital formularies will be the appropriate use and management of 
      these new medications as they become integrated into outpatient care. In order to 
      better understand the issues that pharmacy and therapeutics committees will 
      encounter, a review of the 2 FDA-approved oral anticoagulants will be evaluated.

TI  - Preclinical safety and efficacy of andexanet alfa in animal models.
PG  - 1747-1756
LID - 10.1111/jth.13768 [doi]
AB  - Essentials There is currently no approved reversal agent for factor Xa (FXa) 
      inhibitors Andexanet alfa has been developed to reverse the anticoagulant effects 
      of FXa inhibitors Andexanet reduced blood loss and anticoagulation markers in 
      rivaroxaban-anticoagulated rabbits Andexanet was well tolerated in monkeys and 
      rats, with no evidence of prothrombotic activity SUMMARY: Background Andexanet 
      alfa is a recombinant modified form of factor Xa (FXa), designed to bind to and 
      reverse the anticoagulant activity of FXa inhibitors. Objectives To evaluate the 
      ability of andexanet to reverse the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban, and 
      assess its pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicity in animal models. Methods The 
      effects of andexanet on blood loss, anti-FXa activity, rivaroxaban unbound plasma 
      concentrations and other coagulation parameters were assessed in a rabbit liver 
      laceration 'treatment' model. Andexanet was administered 10 min after blood loss 
      was initiated. The toxicity of repeated administration of andexanet (up to 60 mg 
      kg(-1) day(-1) ) was assessed in cynomolgus monkeys. PK parameters were evaluated 
      in rats and monkeys. Results Excess blood loss due to anticoagulation with 
      rivaroxaban was significantly decreased by a single intravenous bolus 
      administration of andexanet at 35 and 75 mg per rabbit, by 75% and 63%, 
      respectively. This correlated with dose-dependent decreases in the unbound 
      fraction of rivaroxaban and anti-FXa activity. Co-administration of rivaroxaban 
      had no significant impact on the PK parameters of andexanet. Andexanet (up to 60 
      mg kg(-1) day(-1) ) was well tolerated in monkeys, with no accumulation of 
      andexanet or rivaroxaban. There was a single occurrence of anaphylaxis, which 
      resolved after treatment with diphenhydramine and epinephrine. There was no 
      histological evidence of prothrombotic activity with high-dose andexanet compared 
      with vehicle control, as measured by clot and fibrin deposition in all major 
      organs. Conclusions These data suggest that andexanet is a promising therapy for 
      the reversal of FXa inhibitor-induced anticoagulation, supporting clinical 
      studies in humans.

TI  - [From heparin to apixaban: anticoagulants cut both ways?].
PG  - 89-97
LID - 10.1055/s-0032-1328004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regarding anticoagulant therapies there has been a remarkable shift 
      in recent years. The objective of this brief overview is to provide relevant 
      information and guidelines on the advantages and disadvantages of novel 
      anticoagulants addressing specifically the surgical disciplines. Hitherto, 
      conventional anticoagulant therapy in patients with a high thrombosis risk was 
      largely limited to heparins and vitamin-K antagonists (VKA). Their modes of 
      action, the difficulties in managing VKAs (e.g., bridging therapy) and the risk 
      of HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) associated with heparins are briefly 
      discussed. Novel anticoagulants supposedly eliminate these obstacles. 
      Fondaparinux (Arixtra®) is a fully synthetic pentasaccharide which acts like a 
      heparin but has an increased half life. Fondaparinux has a diminished risk of 
      HIT. However, no specific antidote is currently available for Fondaparinux. The 
      novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) dabigatran etexilat (Pradaxa®), rivaroxaban 
      (Xarelto®) and apixaban (Eliquis®), also known as "direct" anticoagulants, act 
      independently from antithrombin by inhibiting thrombin, as in the case of 
      dabigatran, or by inhibiting factor Xa, as in the case of rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban. It is assumed that they are suitable for long-term use and do not 
      require laboratory monitoring. Nevertheless, clinical experience is very limited 
      and caution rather than quick conclusions is necessary. Two major drawbacks are 
      on the one hand the risk of drug accumulation in kidney and/or liver disease and, 
      on the other hand, the lack of specific antidotes. In addition, interactions with 
      other medication may have unexpected effects on serum drug levels. Therefore, the 
      analysis of drug levels in the plasma may become necessary in subgroups of 
      patients. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Studies establishing clear recommendations 
      for the desirable and measurable reference range are needed. Similarly, 
      evidence-based recommendations regarding perioperative prevention of thrombosis 
      are required ("bridging": yes or no?). Irrespective of these issues, the authors 
      predict a further expansion of the use of NOACs.

TI  - Rivaroxaban: a review of its use in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis or 
      pulmonary embolism and the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism.
PG  - 243-62
LID - 10.1007/s40265-013-0174-4 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban (Xarelto(®)), an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, is approved for the 
      initial treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), as 
      well as the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE. It is administered at a fixed 
      oral dose and does not require routine coagulation monitoring. In the 
      EINSTEIN-DVT and EINSTEIN-PE trials, in over 8,000 patients with DVT and/or PE, a 
      single-drug approach with rivaroxaban was shown to be noninferior to standard 
      therapy consisting of subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium overlapping with and 
      followed by an oral dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonist (enoxaparin-VKA) with 
      regard to the incidence of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
      after 3, 6 or 12 months of treatment. Rivaroxaban was generally well tolerated in 
      patients with DVT or PE, with no significant between-group differences in 
      clinically relevant bleeding between the rivaroxaban and enoxaparin-VKA groups. 
      Notably, rivaroxaban was associated with a significantly lower rate of major 
      bleeding compared with enoxaparin-VKA when EINSTEIN-DVT and EINSTEIN-PE data were 
      pooled. Pharmacoeconomic analyses indicated that rivaroxaban may be a 
      cost-effective alternative to enoxaparin-VKA for the treatment of DVT or PE and 
      prevention of recurrent VTE. Extended prophylaxis with rivaroxaban reduced the 
      incidence of symptomatic recurrent VTE to a greater extent than placebo in the 
      EINSTEIN-Extension trial, but was associated with a non-significant increase in 
      the risk of clinically relevant bleeding compared with placebo. In conclusion, 
      rivaroxaban is a reasonable alternative to standard therapy for the treatment of 
      DVT and PE, and as extended thromboprophylaxis.

AB  - Orally active small molecules that selectively and specifically inhibit 
      coagulation serine proteases have been developed for clinical use. For some 
      patients these oral direct inhibitors (ODIs) offer substantial benefits over oral 
      vitamin K antagonists (VKA). However, for the majority of patients with good 
      anticoagulant control with VKAs the advantages of the ODIs are primarily 
      convenience and few drug interactions. The drugs are prescribed at fixed dose 
      without the need for monitoring or dose adjustment in the majority of patients 
      and the rapid onset of anticoagulation and short half-life make initiation and 
      interruption of anticoagulation considerably easier than with VKAs. As yet, 
      specific antidotes to ODIs are not available for clinical use but these are in 
      development as rapid reversal agents. As with all anticoagulants produced so far, 
      there is a correlation between intensity of anticoagulation and bleeding. 
      Consequently, the need to consider the balance of benefit and risk in each 
      individual patient is no less important than with VKA therapy. Dabigatran and 
      rivaroxaban have been chosen for this review as examples of a thrombin inhibitor 
      and an inhibitor of factor Xa respectively. The clinical application of these 
      drugs is the focus of the review.

AB  - Concomitant use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and medications with 
      inhibition/induction effect on P-gp/CYP3A might increase risk of 
      bleeding/treatment failure, respectively. We designed a nested case-control study 
      within a Clalit cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and a cohort of 
      patients with venous thromboembolism, new users of a DOAC (January 1, 2010 to 
      August 24, 2020). Propensity scores were constructed from demographic/clinical 
      characteristics, and medications at cohort entry. Each case of: (i) serious 
      bleeding event; (ii) stroke/systemic emboli (SE) in patients with AF; (iii) 
      recurrent thromboembolism in patients with thromboembolism, was matched by age, 
      sex, length of follow-up, year of cohort entry, DOAC type, and DOAC indication, 
      to up to 20 controls. Within 89,284 patients with AF and venous thromboembolism 
      and 126,302 patient-years of follow-up, there were 1,587 serious bleeding events. 
      Risk of serious bleeding increased in association with concurrent prescription of 
      P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors. Specifically, higher bleeding risk was associated with 
      dabigatran-verapamil, rivaroxaban-verapamil, and rivaroxaban-amiodarone 
      concurrent prescriptions: adjusted odds ratios (ORs) 2.29 (1.13-4.60), 2.18 
      (1.07-4.40), and 1.68 (1.14-2.49), respectively. There were 1,116 events of 
      stroke/SE, in 79,302 DOAC-treated patients with AF and 118,124 patient-years of 
      follow-up. Concomitant use of phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, or 
      levetiracetam was associated with risk for stroke/SE: adjusted OR 2.18 
      (1.55-3.10). Risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism could not be assessed due 
      to the low number of cases. Concurrent prescriptions of dabigatran or rivaroxaban 
      with verapamil, and of rivaroxaban with amiodarone, are associated with increased 
      risk for serious bleeding. Higher risk for stroke/SE in patients with AF is 
      associated with concurrent prescriptions of DOACs with phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
      valproic acid, or levetiracetam.

TI  - New oral anticoagulants: will they replace warfarin?
PG  - 575-80
LID - 10.1016/j.oooo.2011.10.006 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, are considered to be the treatment of 
      choice to prevent thromboembolic events, but problems, such as the need for 
      frequent dose adjustment and monitoring of coagulation status, as well as 
      multiple drug and food interactions, make their use difficult for both physician 
      and patient. Two new anticoagulants are now being considered as possible 
      replacements of vitamin K antagonists. Dabigatran, an oral direct thrombin 
      inhibitor has already been approved in the USA for prevention of stroke in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation. Rivaroxaban, a factor Xa inhibitor, and 
      dabigatran are licensed in Europe and Canada for short-term thromboprophylaxis 
      after elective hip or knee replacement surgery. The advantages of these drugs are 
      that they are safe and effective, require no monitoring, have a direct mode of 
      action against only one clotting factor (thrombin or factor Xa), have limited 
      drug interactions, and have rapid peak blood levels. Based on the fact that 
      dabigatran has already been approved for use in the USA, it would appear that it 
      has an advantage over rivaroxaban in becoming the replacement drug for vitamin K 
      antagonists.

TI  - New compounds in the management of venous thromboembolism after orthopedic 
      surgery: focus on rivaroxaban.
PG  - 855-62
AB  - Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is a member of a new class of oral, direct 
      (antithrombin-independent) factor Xa inhibitors, which restrict thrombin 
      generation both in vitro and in vivo. After oral administration the absorption is 
      near 100%, the bioavailability is near 80%, and the elimination half-life is 5-9 
      hours with mixed excretion via the renal and fecal/biliary routes. The 
      pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban are predictable and consistent with a rapid onset 
      of antithrombotic action within 2 hours after administration. Phase II clinical 
      studies have been carried out in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) 
      or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and a dose of 10 mg once daily for 
      thromboprophylaxis was selected for further clinical development. The results of 
      the phase III studies showed a significantly better antithrombotic efficacy of 
      rivaroxaban compared with enoxaparin both in the short term (10-14 days) in TKA 
      patients and long term (35 +/- 4 days) in THA patients with a comparable safety. 
      Symptomatic thromboembolic events were also significantly reduced with 
      rivaroxaban. Liver enzyme elevation was seen in patients treated with 
      rivaroxaban, but there was no indication of an increased risk of liver toxicity 
      compared with enoxaparin. In conclusion, rivaroxaban is a potent and safe new 
      compound for antithrombotic prophylaxis in orthopedic surgery.

AB  - Treatment with vitamin K antagonists are subject to a common iatrogenic mainly 
      characterized by hemorrhagic stroke. Their narrow therapeutic range associated 
      with variability largely explains this phenomenon. New oral anticoagulants (NOAC) 
      are now available. dabigatran (Pradaxa®) is a direct and specific thrombin 
      inhibitor. It is excreted mainly by the kidney and is the only which can be 
      dialyzed. Rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) and apixaban (Eliquis®) are factor X activated 
      direct inhibitors. They are highly bound to plasma proteins and are metabolized 
      mainly by the liver, via CYP3A4. All NOAC are substrates of P-glycoprotein 
      (P-gp). Due to pharmacological changes, some populations at risk were identified: 
      patients with hepatic impairment, renal impairment, elderly patients or low 
      weight. Some pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug interactions alter the 
      concentration and the expected impact of NOAC. The NOAC does not require 
      biological monitoring. They interfere with the routine coagulation tests which 
      should be interpreted with caution. Specific tests exist and can be used in case 
      of emergencies. Currently, no antidote is available. The new oral anticoagulant 
      look promising in the elderly. However, certain rules must be followed to reduce 
      the risk of iatrogenic.

AB  - New oral anticoagulants such as the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban 
      or the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran lack some of the limitations of the 
      well-known vitamin K-antagonists. Although routine monitoring is not required, 
      large variations in overall exposure can be seen under certain circumstances. 
      Dabigatran is primarily eliminated in unchanged form in the urine and dose has to 
      be adapted according to renal function. The factor Xa inhibitors are 
      CYP3A4-substrates and combination with potent CYP3A4-inhibitors is not allowed. 
      In cases of bleeding or thromboembolic events under treatment, targeted 
      monitoring of drug concentration or anti-FXa- or anti-FIIa-activity may be 
      helpful to identify the underlying cause. In contrast to vitamin K antagonists or 
      heparin, no antidotes are available for the new anticoagulants and the optimal 
      procedure in cases of life-threatening bleeding has not yet been defined. For 
      certain indications such as prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill 
      medical patients study data are (not yet) available. Concerning localization of 
      bleeding sites the new compounds may display a different profile compared to 
      vitamin K-antagonists (less intracranial bleedings). Experience with long-term 
      use (> 5 years) is limited. Therefore careful clinical monitoring of patients 
      considering co-medication and co-morbidity is necessary to allow safe therapy 
      with the new oral anticoagulants.

AB  - The oral direct Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban (Xarelto) shows great promise for 
      prevention of venous thromboembolic events after major elective orthopedic 
      surgery. Its consistent and predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
      across a wide range of patient populations allow administration with fixed dosing 
      and with no coagulation monitoring. In 4 orthopaedic surgery clinical trials 
      (12,700 patients), 10mg postoperative (6-10 hours after the end of surgery) dose, 
      once daily, of oral rivaroxaban, achieved superior efficacy and similar safety to 
      enoxaparin, whatever the dose of enoxaparin. Indeed, 40 mg once a day in Europe 
      and 30 mg bid in US of enoxaparin were compared to the same dose of 10mg once 
      daily of rivaroxaban. Furthermore, there is no difference according to liver 
      enzymes elevation and cardio-vascular adverse events. Although the risk of spinal 
      haematoma after neuraxial anaesthesia is rare, it is increased by concomitant use 
      of anticoagulants. In orthopedic surgery trials with rivaroxaban to date, 
      complications such as spinal haematoma have not been reported. The 
      pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban suggests that concurrent use with 
      neuraxial anaesthesia should require no further precautions than currently 
      necessary with low-molecular-weight heparin.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions with new oral 
      anticoagulants: what do they mean for patients with atrial fibrillation?
PG  - 1478-87
LID - 10.1177/1060028013504741 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions 
      (DDIs) involving new oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation. DATA SOURCES: A 
      literature search was conducted via PubMed and the Cochrane database to identify 
      DDI studies using the terms drug interactions, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and 
      apixaban. Prescribing information and Food and Drug Administration briefing 
      documents were used to supplement published data. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA 
      EXTRACTION: English publications identified on Medline from 2005 up to August 
      2013 and US prescribing information for approved oral anticoagulants. DATA 
      SYNTHESIS: Articles reviewed focused on drugs affecting the permeability 
      glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter protein and/or cytochrome P (CYP) 450 3A4 
      enzymes, and pharmacodynamic DDIs when drugs are administered concomitantly. 
      Phase I DDI studies have reported pharmacokinetic DDIs mediated by P-gp alone 
      (dabigatran etexilate) or in combination with CYP3A4 enzymes (rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban). Dabigatran etexilate should not be administered with any P-gp 
      inhibitor in patients with severe renal impairment. Briefing documents indicate 
      that rivaroxaban and apixaban should not be used with drugs that are strong 
      inhibitors of both P-gp and CYP3A4. DDI studies involving rifampicin suggest that 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban should be avoided when strong inducers of P-gp and 
      CYP3A4 are used concurrently. Concomitant use of apixaban and strong dual 
      inhibitors of P-gp and CYP3A4 should be avoided or the dose reduced. Five 
      randomized clinical trials report additive effects with rivaroxaban, dabigatran, 
      and apixaban when used concomitantly with antiplatelet agents; bleeding rates 
      have been found to be higher, especially with dual antiplatelet therapy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of drugs that alter the function of the P-gp efflux 
      transporter protein and CYP3A4 enzymes and provide additive effects should enable 
      prescribers to anticipate and avoid potential DDIs involving the new oral 
      anticoagulants. To this end, briefing documents and prescribing information have 
      applied cautionary measures for individuals treated with these newer 
      anticoagulants.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Warfarin has been the sole oral anticoagulant used in the 
      management of thromboembolic disorders for over 60 years. Target-specific oral 
      anticoagulants (TSOAs) have recently emerged as alternatives to warfarin, because 
      they do not require laboratory monitoring. Nevertheless, with the rising use of 
      TSOAs, there is growing concern among clinicians regarding management of bleeding 
      in patients taking them. Unlike warfarin, there is no antidote or reversal agent 
      for TSOAs. This review summarizes recent developments and attempts to provide a 
      systematic approach to patients on TSOAs presenting with bleeding complications. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, data involving clinical management of TSOAs are 
      limited and primarily based on ex-vivo or animal models using hemostatic agents 
      with uncertain implications in bleeding patients. There is a pressing need for 
      randomized clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of hemostatic 
      agents. SUMMARY: Without evidence-based guidelines for TSOA management, 
      appropriate patient care requires an understanding of TSOA pharmacology, their 
      effect on coagulation tests and, hence, a correct interpretation of test results, 
      as well as a systematic approach to bleeding complications.

AB  - Vitamin K antagonists have been in wide use for over 70 years. Warfarin, the most 
      commonly used vitamin K antagonist, has been shown to be highly effective in 
      treating and preventing thrombosis. Despite this, warfarin has many 
      disadvantages, which has led to the development of a new class of oral 
      anticoagulants targeted to specific coagulation factors designated as 
      target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOAs). TSOAs include the thrombin 
      inhibitors (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban). This 
      chapter reviews the disadvantages of warfarin and evaluates both the advantages 
      and disadvantages of the new oral anticoagulants.

TI  - A new era for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation. Which anticoagulant should 
      we choose for long‑term prevention of thromboembolic complications in patients 
      with atrial fibrillation?
PG  - 45-53
AB  - For more than 60 years, vitamin K antagonists have been the only available oral 
      anticoagulants for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial 
      fibrillation (AF). Several new molecules, with a favorable pharmacokinetic 
      profile and avoiding routine monitoring, have been recently developed, opening a 
      new era in anticoagulation. The oral direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, and 
      the oral activated factor X inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, are the novel 
      oral anticoagulants with data from large randomized clinical trials showing that 
      these drugs are noninferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and

      several practical issues (e.g., lack of specific antidote, safety of long-term 
      treatment or cost-effectiveness in "real-life" clinical practice) still need to 
      be elucidated.

TI  - Rivaroxaban: new drug. After hip or knee replacement surgery: LMWH is safer.
PG  - 151-3
AB  - (1) The standard anticoagulant therapy for prevention of thrombosis after hip or 
      knee replacement surgery is subcutaneous injection of a low-molecular-weight 
      heparin, such as enoxaparin; (2) Rivaroxaban is an oral factor-Xa inhibitor 
      anticoagulant approved for use in these indications in the European Union; (3) 
      Four double-blind controlled trials in more than 12 000 patients undergoing hip 
      or knee replacement surgery failed to show that rivaroxaban was any more 
      effective than enoxaparin on relevant clinical outcomes; there was no reduction 
      in mortality, nor in the incidence of pulmonary embolism and symptomatic deep 
      venous thrombosis; (4) In the selected populations enrolled in these trials, the 
      bleeding risk was similar in the rivaroxaban and enoxaparin groups. However, it 
      is possible that very underweight or overweight patients have an increased 
      bleeding risk with rivaroxaban; (5) More information is needed on the 
      nephrotoxicity of rivaroxaban, and a risk of mitochondrial toxicity cannot be 
      ruled out. Post-marketing studies also need to focus on the consequences of wound 
      seepage, which is more frequent with rivaroxaban. (6) Rivaroxaban is metabolized 
      by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP 3A4 and binds to P-glycoprotein, hence a 
      high risk of pharmacokinetic interactions; (7) Rivaroxaban has the advantage of 
      being an oral treatment that does not require laboratory monitoring. However, it 
      seems best to monitor renal function. It should also be noted that there is no 
      effective antidote if severe bleeding occurs; (8) In practice, for frail elderly 
      patients, who are often polymedicated, it seems more prudent to continue using 
      low-molecular-weight heparin, a drug with which we have more experience.

AB  - Polymorphisms in CYP2C9, a critical cytochrome P-450 enzyme in the metabolism of 
      warfarin, alters its clearance and affects dosing. CYP*1 has higher activity than 
      either the *2 or *3 variants, and patients with the *2 or *3 variants require a 
      lower dose. VKORC1 is the enzyme inhibited by warfarin, and its levels are 
      affected by several polymorphisms that can be divided into high or low level 
      haplotypes, and patients with high level haplotypes require higher warfarin 
      doses. The use of algorithms for dosing that incorporate pharmacogenomic 
      information perform better than those using clinical data alone. Considerable 
      effort is ongoing to develop new oral anticoagulants as alternatives to warfarin, 
      and three agents are in advanced development. Dabigatran is an oral direct 
      thrombin inhibitor that has been compared with enoxaparin for prevention of VTE 
      following hip or knee replacement. Based on non-inferiority results in European 
      trials, it has now been approved for marketing in Europe. Phase III trials with a 
      new oral Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, have been completed in hip or knee 
      replacement, and rivaroxaban was superior to enoxaparin in prevention of VTE with 
      no increase in bleeding complications. Phase III studies with apixaban, another 
      oral Xa inhibitor, are in progress. These agents are also being evaluated in 
      large studies for prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation and for VTE 
      treatment.

AB  - Bariatric surgery may alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or 
      elimination (disposition) of orally administered drugs via changes to the 
      gastrointestinal tract anatomy, body weight, and adipose tissue composition. As 
      some patients who have undergone bariatric surgery will need therapeutic 
      anticoagulation for various indications, appropriate knowledge is needed 
      regarding anticoagulant drug disposition and resulting efficacy and safety in 
      this population. We review general considerations about oral drug disposition in 
      patients after bariatric surgery, as well as existing literature on oral 
      anticoagulation after bariatric surgery. Overall, available evidence on 
      therapeutic anticoagulation is very limited, and individual drug studies are 
      necessary to learn how to safely and effectively use the direct oral 
      anticoagulants. Given the sparsity of currently available data, it appears most 
      prudent to use warfarin with international normalized ratio monitoring, and not 
      direct oral anticoagulants, when full-dose anticoagulation is needed after 
      bariatric surgery.

PG  - 982-989
LID - 10.2174/1389201019666181112100612 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the last years, a new generation of oral anticoagulants (NOACs), 
      including apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran, has been developed for the 
      control of thrombosis and related disorders. The presence of food within the 
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract can potentially affect the oral bioavailability of 
      drugs. OBJECTIVE: In the present paper, we evaluated the stability of these drugs 
      in in vitro GI digestion, with and without the main macronutrients such as 
      proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and fibers, and their ability to enter into the 
      systemic circulation. In addition, we examined the percentage of the drug binding 
      to plasma proteins, such as human serum albumin, high density- and low density 
      lipoproteins. METHODS: The NOACs bioaccessibility was evaluated by an in vitro 
      procedure simulating the gastrointestinal enzymatic system, while their 
      bioavailability was studied by cell culture of Caco-2 cells and in vitro study of 
      transepithelial transport. The in vitro transepithelial permeated NOACs were 
      added to plasma protein solutions simulating the average fasting plasma protein 
      concentrations. The NOACs detection was carried out by HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS analysis. 
      RESULTS: GI digestion significantly reduces intestinal bioaccessibility and 
      bioavailability of NOACs, especially as regards apixaban and dabigatran. 
      Interestingly, the co-digestion of fibers led to a strong decrease of NOAC 
      intestinal bioaccessibility and bioavailability, while the effects of the other 
      macronutrients, as well as a low fiber standard meal, had no significant 
      influence in this sense. CONCLUSION: Dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban may be 
      administered independently of a standard meal, provided that it does not include 
      a high amount of dietary fibers.

TI  - Novel oral anticoagulants: a review of new agents.
PG  - 103-14
LID - 10.3810/pgm.2013.07.2683 [doi]
AB  - Until recently, warfarin had been one of the only treatment options for long-term 
      anticoagulation of patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, or 
      other medical conditions that require chronic anticoagulation. A main concern 
      when treating patients with anticoagulants is balancing the benefits of 
      preventing a thromboembolic event with the risks of bleeding events. The US Food 
      and Drug Administration recently approved 2 new oral anticoagulants, dabigatran 
      and rivaroxaban, for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, and 
      is currently reviewing a drug application for a third new oral anticoagulant, 
      apixaban. These new anticoagulants do not require strict and frequent laboratory 
      monitoring, dosing adjustments, or dietary restrictions, and they incur fewer 
      drug-drug interactions than warfarin. However, these new medications do not have 
      specific reversal agents, may require dosage adjustment based on patient renal 
      function, and lack clinical data regarding their long-term safety and efficacy. 
      The 2012 American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice 
      Guidelines for antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis include 
      recommendations for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban for certain 
      indications. Each of the 3 novel oral anticoagulants has specific pharmacokinetic 
      and pharmacodynamic properties that may make them suitable agents for use in 
      specific patient populations. Knowledge of dosing, drug-drug interactions, 
      monitoring parameters, and clinical considerations for each of these new 
      medications will help clinicians decide for which patients they may be best 
      suited to replace conventional therapy with warfarin.

TI  - New anticoagulants for stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation: assessing the 
      impact on medication adherence.
PG  - 287-94
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is a 
      potent risk factor for stroke and transient ischemic attack. Most patients with 
      AF receive antithrombotic stroke prophylaxis, often in the form of a vitamin K 
      antagonist, typically warfarin. Drug treatment with warfarin is associated with 
      significant management issues, such as an unpredictable dose response 
      necessitating dose adjustments, frequent laboratory monitoring, and multiple 
      interactions with other medications, as well as foods. A new generation of novel 
      anticoagulants has emerged that includes dabigatran etexilate, a direct thrombin 
      inhibitor, and rivaroxaban and apixaban, both highly selective factor Xa 
      inhibitors. These newer agents possess a highly predictable 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship, allowing for fixed dosing and no 
      necessity for routine laboratory monitoring; additionally these agents have 
      minimal drug interactions. Dabigatran etexilate and apixaban are both twice-daily 
      medications, whereas rivaroxaban is administered once daily for stroke 
      prophylaxis. The impact of dosing frequency on medication adherence with these 
      agents has not been prospectively evaluated; however, the frequency of dosing 
      intervals has been shown to affect medication adherence, which in turn may 
      influence patient outcomes.

TI  - An open-label study to estimate the effect of steady-state erythromycin on the 
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of a single dose of rivaroxaban in 
      subjects with renal impairment and normal renal function.
PG  - 1407-20
LID - 10.1002/jcph.352 [doi]
AB  - Two previously conducted rivaroxaban studies showed that, separately, renal 
      impairment (RI) and concomitant administration of erythromycin (P-glycoprotein 
      and moderate cytochrome P450 3A4 [CYP3A4] inhibitor) can result in increases in 
      rivaroxaban exposure. However, these studies did not assess the potential for 
      combined drug-drug-disease interactions, which-in theory-could lead to additive 
      or synergistic increases in exposure. This study investigated rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics when co-administered with steady-state (SS) 
      erythromycin in subjects with either mild or moderate RI. Similar to previous 
      studies, rivaroxaban administered alone in RI subjects, or when co-administered 
      with SS erythromycin in normal renal function (NRF) subjects, increased 
      rivaroxaban exposure. When combined, the co-administration of rivaroxaban 10 mg 
      with SS erythromycin in subjects with mild or moderate RI produced mean increases 
      in rivaroxaban AUC∞ and Cmax of approximately 76% and 56%, and 99% and 64%, 
      respectively, relative to NRF subjects, with PD changes displaying a similar 
      trend. No serious adverse events occurred and no persistent adverse events were 
      reported at the end of study. Although these increases were slightly more than 
      additive, rivaroxaban should not be used in patients with RI receiving 
      concomitant combined P-glycoprotein and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, unless the 
      potential benefit justifies the potential risk.

AB  - As of September 2013, three new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are now available for 
      clinical use on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in Australia. All three are 
      for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and one will also be available for 
      the treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. All have been 
      evaluated in large, multicentre randomised clinical trials. These drugs show at 
      least equivalent efficacy to the current standard of care, the vitamin K 
      antagonist warfarin. Major bleeding rates are overall comparable with warfarin, 
      but there is an important reduction in intracranial bleeding of approximately 50% 
      with all NOAC agents. The NOACs are administered in a simple, fixed dose regimen. 
      There are a few clinically important interactions with other medications or diet. 
      Concerns exist about the potential for irreversible bleeding in the small number 
      of patients in which that occurs. This short report will discuss the pharmacology 
      of these agents, the indications for use, aspects of laboratory monitoring and 
      the management of bleeding with these agents.

TI  - Testing the therapeutic equivalence of novel oral anticoagulants for 
      thromboprophylaxis in orthopedic surgery and for prevention of stroke in atrial 
      fibrillation.
PG  - 211-9
LID - 10.5414/CP202183 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In studying the comparative effectiveness of novel oral 
      anticoagulants (NOACs) in orthopedic surgery and in non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation, previous meta-analyses have found no proof of difference in 
      head-to-head indirect comparisons between individual agents. However, the 
      question of their therapeutic equivalence remains unanswered. OBJECTIVES: The 
      objective of this analysis was to test the equivalence of three NOACs 
      (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) in orthopedic surgery and four NOACs 
      (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) in non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation. METHODS: Standard pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis 
      for indirect comparisons were combined with equivalence testing. The endpoint was 
      venous thromboembolism in orthopedic surgery and a composite of stroke or 
      systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation. Comparisons were expressed as risk 
      difference (RD). Margins for equivalence testing were derived from the original 
      trials. RESULTS: Our results indicate that rivaroxaban and apixaban (but not 
      dabigatran) are equivalent for thromboprophylaxis in orthopedic surgery. In 
      atrial fibrillation, all the four NOACs we tested were found to meet the 
      criterion of therapeutic equivalence. Some concern, however, is raised by some 
      findings focused on adverse events of these agents, in which the equivalence was 
      not proven in all analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of clinical implications, our 
      results can be the basis to develop local acquisition tenderings on NOACS. In 
      Italy, a new law has been issued according to which equivalence analyses have 
      become a mandatory prerequisite for local tenderings.

TI  - Nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant use in patients with renal impairment.
PG  - 243-256
LID - 10.1177/1753944717714921 [doi]
AB  - The nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), also referred to as 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban, have emerged as effective alternatives to vitamin K antagonists 
      (VKAs) across several indications, including the prevention of stroke and 
      systemic embolism (SSE) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and the 
      treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Their use in patients with renal 
      impairment is of particular importance, given the prevalence of renal dysfunction 
      in the indicated populations and the impact of renal function on the metabolism 
      of the NOACs. This publication reviews the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
      properties of the NOACs and clinical trial results for patients with renal 
      impairment within the AF and VTE indications. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
      data show the NOACs are dependent on renal clearance to varying extents. Relative 
      to VKAs, the efficacy and safety of the NOACs is preserved in patients with 
      moderate renal impairment. The dosing recommendations for patients with renal 
      impairment differ depending on the NOAC, whereby some of the NOACs require dose 
      reductions based solely on renal function, while others require consideration of 
      additional criteria. However, despite these specific dosing recommendations, 
      emerging real-world evidence suggests patients are not being dosed appropriately, 
      indicating a possible knowledge gap. Adherence to recommended dosing algorithms 
      has implications on the optimal efficacy and safety of the NOACs. To this end, 
      renal function should be assessed in patients on a NOAC, as worsening of renal 
      function may warrant change in the dose of a NOAC or change in oral 
      anticoagulant.

TI  - Novel oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation: dawn of a new era.
PG  - 34-44
LID - 10.3810/pgm.2013.01.2622 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important cause of ischemic stroke and is the 
      underlying cause of > 20% of all strokes, with increasing age being a risk 
      factor. Until recently, warfarin was the only available oral anticoagulant used 
      to decrease this risk in patients with AF. However, there are several 
      disadvantages of warfarin use, such as the requirement for monitoring the 
      international normalized ratio, its wide range of drug-food interactions, and its 
      narrow therapeutic index. Thus, there has been a strong impetus for the 
      development of newer oral anticoagulants with predictable pharmacokinetics that 
      obviate the need for monitoring the international normalized ratio. The US Food 
      and Drug Administration has approved a direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) and 
      2 factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban and apixaban) for stroke prevention in 
      patients with nonvalvular AF. There are several other new oral anticoagulant 
      agents on the horizon, including the factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban. This review

AB  - New oral anticoagulants promise to overcome essential drawbacks of traditional 
      substances. They have a predictable therapeutic effect, a wide therapeutic 
      window, only limited interaction with food and drugs and can be administered p.o. 
      with a fixed dose. On the other hand, knowledge on the laboratory management of 
      new anticoagulants is limited. In the present article we discuss possible 
      indications and available assays for monitoring of Rivaroxaban, Apixaban and 
      Dabigatran. Furthermore, we discuss interpretation of routine coagulation tests 
      during therapy with these new drugs.

AB  - The direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, and the selective factor Xa 
      inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, are new oral anticoagulants that are 
      approved in many countries for prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients 
      undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty. All have a rapid onset of action, a 
      low potential for food and drug interactions and a predictable anticoagulant 
      effect that obviates the need for routine coagulation monitoring. These agents 
      offer a convenient alternative to conventional anticoagulant drug regimens, 
      including parenteral low-molecular-weight heparins and fondaparinux, and oral 
      adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonists, for the prevention of venous thromboembolism 
      in this surgical setting. This review summarizes the pharmacology, clinical trial 
      results, bleeding risk and practical use of these new oral anticoagulants in 
      clinical orthopaedic practice. Potential issues to be considered when using these 
      oral anticoagulants include renal impairment, potential drug interactions, 
      neuraxial anaesthesia and management of bleeding.

AB  - Hospitalized medical and surgical patients encompass a group of patients in whom 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) poses a major concern on morbidity and mortality. 
      Recently, direct oral anticoagulants for the prevention of VTE have been 
      developed to overcome the drawbacks of the food/drug interactions and the need 
      for frequent laboratory monitoring and dose adjustments associated with the use 
      of vitamin K antagonists and the inconvenience of the subcutaneous administration 
      of low-molecular-weight heparins and fondaparinux. The novel oral anticoagulants 
      that have been tested in major clinical trials for VTE prevention in medical and 
      surgical patients are the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa 
      inhibitors apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban, which will be the focus of this 
      review. While the new drugs proved to be highly effective and safe in the 
      prevention of VTE following major orthopedic surgery, they failed to show a 
      favorable benefit-to-risk profile in hospitalized medical patients receiving 
      extended anticoagulation beyond the hospital stay.

TI  - Current developments for the oral delivery of heparin.
PG  - 640-9
AB  - Anticoagulant therapy is widely used for the treatment and prophylaxis of deep 
      vein thrombosis and coronary syndromes. Until now, drugs such as unfractionated 
      heparin and low molecular weight heparins need to be administered parenterally. 
      Parenteral administration results in lower patient compliance compared to oral 
      therapy and for this reason, the focus of various research groups is to develop 
      an oral heparin formulation which is as effective as the parenteral formulation, 
      easy to use and non-toxic. In the last few years, some new oral anticoagulants 
      like Rivaroxaban (Xarelto(®)), Apixaban (Eliquis(®)) and Dabigatranetexilat 
      (Pradaxa(®)) have reached the market, but their use is limited to certain 
      indications. Therefore, the development of oral formulations with 
      well-established anti-coagulant drugs is still relevant and in demand. In this 
      paper, we reviewed strategies that have been developed so far to achieve an 
      adequate anticoagulant effect using oral formulations of unfractionated and low 
      molecular weight heparins.

AB  - What is the correct use of established clotting factors, prothrombin complex 
      concentrates (PCCs), and activated factor VII in bleeding complications of 
      trauma, surgery, and old and new oral anticoagulants? How will new clotting 
      factors, specifically the long-acting factors, change the hemostatic management 
      of coagulation deficiency disorders? From bench to bedside, comparative 
      coagulation studies and clinical trials of modified clotting factors are 
      providing insights to help guide hemostatic management of congenital and acquired 
      bleeding disorders. Comparative thrombin-generation studies and preclinical and 
      clinical trials suggest that PCCs and fresh-frozen plasma are effective in 
      reversing the anticoagulant effects of warfarin, yet there are few data to guide 
      reversal of the new oral anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban. Although 
      coagulation studies support the use of PCCs to reverse new oral anticoagulants, 
      correlation with clinical response is variable and clinical trials in bleeding 
      patients are needed. For congenital bleeding disorders, exciting new technologies 
      are emerging from the bench. Data from clinical trials of molecularly modified 
      coagulation factors with extended half-lives suggest the possibility of fewer 
      infusions, reduced bleeds, and better quality of life in persons with hemophilia. 
      Preclinical studies of other novel prohemostatic approaches for hemophilia and 
      other congenital coagulation disorders include RNA interference silencing of 
      antithrombin, monoclonal anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor (anti-antibody, 
      anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor) aptamer, bispecific anti-IXa/X antibody, 
      and fucoidans. Understanding the comparative coagulation studies of established 
      prohemostatic agents, the pharmacokinetics of new long-acting clotting factors, 
      and their correlation with bleeding outcomes will provide opportunities to 
      optimize the hemostatic management of both congenital and acquired hemostatic 
      disorders.

      of hypercoagulability in patients with chronic heart failure.
PG  - 218-26
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2010.08.027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is associated with a hypercoagulable state that 
      predisposes to thromboembolism and anti-coagulation may improve clinical 
      outcomes. The oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, has not been studied 
      in patients with HF. We hypothesized that rivaroxaban would also reduce 
      biomarkers of hypercoagulability in patients with HF. METHODS: This study 
      consisted of two cohorts: Cohort 1, open-label, actively controlled with 
      enoxaparin 40 mg once daily, included 8 patients with acute decompensated HF; 
      Cohort 2, double-blind and placebo-controlled, included 18 patients with stable, 
      severe New York Heart Association Class III/IV HF. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of rivaroxaban were similar across both cohorts. 
      Biomarker assessments were performed in Cohort 2; prothrombin fragment 1.2 (F1.2) 
      mean concentration decreased by 2.7 ng/ml over 7 days with rivaroxaban, and 
      increased by 11.6 ng/ml with placebo, an absolute difference of 14.3 ng/ml (p = 
      0.0009). A non-significant reduction in rate of increase of D-dimer (DD) and 
      thrombin-anti-thrombin complex (TAT) levels with rivaroxaban was observed over 7 
      days (p = 0.31 and p = 0.77, respectively). CONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban has similar 
      PK/PD in patients with either acute or chronic HF. In vivo, hypercoagulability 
      biomarkers appear to increase over time. Rivaroxaban reversed this trend for 
      F1.2, and may reduce the rate of increase of DD and TAT in patients with stable, 
      severe HF.

TI  - The new or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants: what have we learned 
      since their debut.
PG  - 188-94
LID - 10.1055/s-0035-1544159 [doi]
AB  - One of the major advances in the management of thrombosis is arguably the 
      introduction of the new non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). 
      These are small molecules, designed to directly inhibit specific steps in the 
      coagulation pathway, with dabigatran (Pradaxa), inhibiting thrombin and 
      rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixiban (Eliquis), edoxaban (Lixiana), and betrixaban 
      being factor Xa inhibitors. They have several advantages over vitamin K 
      antagonists such as warfarin, with more predictable bioavailability, fewer drug 
      interactions, and improved safety, especially intracranial hemorrhage. Yet, since 
      their debut, several issues have arisen with their increasing usage, with 
      concerns over monitoring and reversal, being predominant. Issues addressed in 
      this article include their efficacy, bleeding risk, and the recognition of a 
      vulnerable population where monitoring is needed. The current approach to 
      reversing the drug action is updated. The change in the approach to future drug 
      design is also discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Until recently, only vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were used for 
      long-term anticoagulation. New oral anticoagulants, with pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic characteristics different to VKAs, are now available for some 
      indications. Rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) is an oral Factor Xa inhibitor approved in 
      many countries for long-term treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation or 
      venous thromboembolism. This article is addressed to all professionals involved 
      in the management of treated patients to highlight the characteristics of 
      rivaroxaban and provide practical guidance on management of treated patients. 
      AREAS COVERED: This article is based on a consensus of specialists involved in 
      the management of anticoagulant treatment, including thrombosis experts, 
      cardiologists, neurologists, emergency medicine specialists, and general 
      practitioners. The authors performed a nonsystematic review of the literature, 
      and expressed guidance statements based on the results of the review as well as 
      personal experience. EXPERT OPINION: Availability of new anticoagulant drugs, 
      including rivaroxaban, is an important step forward to allow easier, more 
      effective, and safer long-term anticoagulation in patients in whom adequate 
      anticoagulation is currently denied due to the limitations of VKAs. However, 
      given their totally new properties, associated risks, and expected broad clinical 
      use, expert professionals and manufacturers must urgently tackle a series of 
      issues.

AB  - Heparins and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) used commonly are the standard treatment 
      of venous and arterial thromboses. They are very efficient and safe, but have 
      some limitations: iatrogenicity, laboratory monitoring, parenteral use for 
      heparins and fondaparinux. Nowadays, four new inhibitors of factor Xa are used 
      orally (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), and they are at least as 
      efficient as heparins and vitamin K antagonists. The objective is to substitute 
      these indirect inhibitors of factor Xa (heparins, low molecular weight heparins 
      and fondaparinux) in the prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic 
      episodes. The new direct inhibitors do not require routine laboratory monitoring 
      of blood coagulation. They inhibit the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways of 
      blood coagulation. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are efficacious and safe in the 
      prevention of cerebral infarcts in patients with non-valvular fibrillation. 
      Apixaban is another direct inhibitor of factor Xa used orally which is developed 
      in the same indications as rivaroxaban. Edoxaban and betrixaban are also in 
      development. The objective of this work is to study the pharmacodynamic, 
      pharmacokinetic, the efficacy and safety of these four oral direct factor Xa 
      inhibitors.

TI  - Old versus new anticoagulants: focus on pharmacology.
PG  - 120-37
AB  - Heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and warfarin are well-established 
      anticoagulants still in widespread use despite their well known drawbacks. 
      Heparin requires continuous monitoring, has serious side-effects such as 
      haemorrhage, thrombosis and osteoporosis, and lacks an oral route of 
      administration. LMWH is a safer, more convenient anticoagulant to use but it 
      cannot be given orally, does not have an antidote and may be difficult to 
      administer in patients with renal failure. Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic 
      window, interacts with other drugs and foods and requires monitoring like 
      heparin. The limitations of all three of these established anticoagulants have 
      prompted the search for better more convenient agents. The major examples of 
      these newer anticoagulants are the direct and indirect factor Xa inhibitors and 
      the direct thrombin inhibitors. These new agents tend to have more predictable 
      pharmacokinetic properties, superior efficacy and safety and some can be 
      administered orally. In this review, we summarise the advantages and 
      disadvantages of three established anticoagulants (heparin, LMWH and warfarin) 
      and the most promising new anticoagulants (fondaparinux, idraparinux, 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran and ximelagatran) by discussing their 
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. We also discuss recent patents in the 
      field of anticoagulation, which aim to improve the safety and effectiveness of 
      antithrombotic agents currently in use or offer alternative ways for 
      anticoagulation.

AB  - Oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) is widely used to prevent and treat 
      thromboembolic events. Traditionally, warfarin has been the drug of choice and, 
      indeed, this drug is effective and provides a more than 60% reduction in stroke 
      risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, OAT entails an increased 
      bleeding risk, and management of this is challenging. Among other things, new 
      oral anticoagulant drugs offer fixed dosing, more predictable pharmacokinetics 
      and fewer interactions with drugs and food. Moreover, these drugs seem to provide 
      an improved benefit-risk ratio with respect to thromboembolic events and bleeding 
      complications in a broad patient population. The new drugs differ from 
      traditional OAT with respect to their mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics, 
      especially with respect to elimination through the kidneys. These drugs may 
      potentially cause bleeding complications in patients with reduced drug excretion 
      due to impaired renal function. Dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban carry the 
      highest risk due to a high degree of renal excretion, whereas the risk for 
      apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban seems lower. Pharmacokinetic studies and data 
      from clinical studies have provided information on how to guide dosing in 
      patients with renal impairment. However, the risk of drug accumulation and 
      bleeding may be amplified by several drug-drug interactions. This article 
      provides a review of the literature on the pharmacology of new anticoagulant 
      drugs with particular focus on the impact of impaired renal function.

AB  - Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are the only registered oral anticoagulants for the 
      treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). VKA have an unpredictable and highly 
      variable effect on coagulation, with a high risk of under- and over-treatment. 
      Novel anticoagulants, such as dabigatran and rivaroxaban, could be a very welcome 
      replacement for VKA, as they show a predictable anticoagulant effect. Results of 
      several phase II and III studies have shown the efficacy and safety of dabigatran 
      and rivaroxaban in the prophylaxis and treatment of VTE, and for the prevention 
      of stroke in atrial fibrillation. It remains to be shown whether these new 
      anticoagulants have the same safety profile in daily clinical practice, where 
      more vulnerable patients will be treated. Lack of information on the proper 
      monitoring method or antidote in case of bleeding may also hinder the translation 
      from science to clinical practice.

AB  - The blood coagulation enzyme factor Xa (FXa) is a particularly promising target 
      for anticoagulant therapy, and identification of oral small-molecule inhibitors 
      of FXa remains a research focus. On the basis of the X-ray crystal structure of 
      FXa and its inhibitor rivaroxaban, we designed and synthesized a series of 
      conformationally restricted mimics containing a novel [6,6,5] tricyclic fused 
      oxazolidinone scaffold. Intensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) and 
      structure-pharmacokinetic relationship (SPR) studies on this new series led to 
      the discovery of compound 11a: a highly potent, selective, direct, and orally 
      bioavailable FXa inhibitor with excellent in vivo antithrombotic efficacy and 
      preferable pharmacokinetic profiles. Druggability evaluation of compound 11a was 
      undertaken and elicited positive outcomes. All results indicate that compound 11a 
      is a promising drug candidate for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic 
      diseases in venous and arterial systems.

TI  - The laboratory and the new oral anticoagulants.
PG  - 353-62
LID - 10.1373/clinchem.2012.189704 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The new oral anticoagulants (NOAs) dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and 
      apixaban have proved effective and safe when used in clinical trials, without a 
      need to adjust the dose in response to laboratory testing. This demonstrated 
      efficacy does not necessarily mean that the laboratory, considered the mainstay 
      for the management of the old anticoagulants, will no longer play a role in 
      treatment with NOAs. CONTENT: Laboratories are involved in the management of 
      anticoagulants in 2 ways. The first, monitoring, implies laboratory testing to 
      assess the drug's effect and to adjust the dosage to maintain anticoagulation 
      within the therapeutic interval. This consideration applies to the old drugs. The 
      second way, measurement, implies laboratory evaluations of drug effect to 
      determine whether patients are under- or over-anticoagulated, information that 
      can be useful for decision-making in special circumstances. The latter applies to 
      NOAs. SUMMARY: Measurements of the effect of NOAs are indicated in several 
      situations: (a) patients with adverse events (i.e., thrombotic/hemorrhagic), 
      particularly those who present with overdosage owing to excessive drug intake or 
      decreased clearance; (b) patients undergoing surgical procedures for ensuring 
      that no residual drug remains in the circulation; (c) patients requiring 
      anticoagulation reversal because of life-threatening hemorrhage; (d) patients 
      with renal insufficiency, who are likely to accumulate the drug in the 
      circulation; (e) patients with liver failure, because NOAs are metabolized by the 
      liver; (f) patients taking other drugs that might increase/decrease the effects 
      of NOAs via drug-drug interactions. The choice of tests is based on such 
      characteristics as availability, linearity of the dose-response curve, 
      standardization, and responsiveness to increasing drug dosage. Practitioners need 
      to be aware that NOAs can interfere with the measurement of common hemostasis 
      parameters.

AB  - Although currently available anticoagulants are effective for the prevention and 
      treatment of thromboembolic disorders, they have several drawbacks. Low molecular 
      weight heparin and fondaparinux produce a predictable level of anticoagulation 
      that obviates the need for coagulation monitoring, but they must be given 
      parenterally, which renders them inconvenient for long-term use. Vitamin K 
      antagonists, such as warfarin, are administered orally, but produce a variable 
      anticoagulant response because genetic polymorphisms, dietary vitamin K intake 
      and multiple drug-drug interactions affect their metabolism. Consequently, 
      coagulation monitoring and frequent dose adjustments are needed to ensure that a 
      therapeutic level of anticoagulation is achieved. This is burdensome for patients 
      and physicians, and costly for the healthcare system. These limitations have 
      prompted the development of new oral anticoagulants that target thrombin or 
      factor Xa. The new agents produce such a predictable anticoagulant response that 
      they can be given in fixed doses without monitoring. This paper focuses on the 
      new oral anticoagulants in the most advanced stages of development.

TI  - Management of hemorrhage with the target-specific oral anticoagulants.
PG  - 75-83
LID - 10.3810/hp.2014.08.1120 [doi]
AB  - The target-specific oral anticoagulants have recently been introduced as 
      alternatives to warfarin for both prophylactic and therapeutic indications. 
      Although their efficacy and side-effect profiles have been favorable, there is 
      significant concern about management of hemorrhage with these agents as there is 
      no direct reversal agent available. It is important for clinicians to be aware of 
      these agents and the issues that surround them. Most of the management of 
      hemorrhage is based on expert opinion and case reviews. Given the potentially 
      catastrophic consequences of acute hemorrhage while patients are on 
      anticoagulation, specific treatments are needed. Some methods that have been 
      described include activated charcoal, hemodialysis, prohemostatic agents, and 
      transfusions. Target-specific therapies have been shown to be effective in early 
      studies in animal models; however, the effects in humans are still under 
      investigation. More investigation is needed on the management of bleeding 
      complications from target-specific oral anticoagulants.

TI  - Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in cardiovascular disease 
      management: evidence and unanswered questions.
PG  - 118-35
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.12122 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Anticoagulation is important in the management of 
      cardiovascular disorders; however, traditional anticoagulants such as heparins 
      and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have limitations, including parenteral 
      administration with the former and the need for coagulation monitoring and dose 
      adjustments with the latter. Three non-VKA oral anticoagulants (OACs), 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban, are available for the prevention of stroke 
      in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and may change clinical practice. This 
      article reviews current knowledge and important unanswered questions on the use 
      of these agents in patients with cardiovascular disease. METHODS: A literature 
      search was performed using PubMed and the search terms dabigatran, rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, AF and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Peer-reviewed, published clinical 
      trials, review articles, relevant treatment guidelines and prescribing 
      information documents were identified and reviewed for relevance. RESULTS AND 
      DISCUSSION: Dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor; rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban are oral direct Factor Xa inhibitors. These agents have a quicker onset 
      and offset of action, more predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      profiles, and fewer drug-drug interactions than VKAs, allowing use of fixed 
      doses. For the prevention of stroke in patients with AF, the non-VKA OACs were 
      either non-inferior or superior to warfarin with similar or improved bleeding 
      profiles, particularly with respect to reductions in intracranial haemorrhage. In 
      patients with ACS receiving dual antiplatelet therapy, the addition of 
      rivaroxaban significantly reduced the rate of death from cardiovascular causes, 
      myocardial infarction or stroke without increasing fatal bleeding, but led to 
      higher rates of major bleeding. Dose reductions with non-VKA OACs are mandated in 
      certain circumstances in patients with AF, such as moderate renal impairment. 
      Contraindications include creatinine clearance <15 mL/min (<30 mL/min for 
      dabigatran in Europe and Canada) and moderate or severe hepatic impairment, but 
      patients can be transitioned to other anticoagulants if appropriate. It is 
      unknown which non-VKA OAC is optimal for stroke prevention in patients with AF, 
      although factors such as co-medications (e.g. dabigatran may be preferred if a 
      patient is taking a co-medication that is a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor) 
      and renal function (rivaroxaban and apixaban depend less on renal clearance than 
      dabigatran) will be important for individual patients. Addition of rivaroxaban to 
      antiplatelet therapy for prevention of recurrent events in patients with recent 
      ACS is approved in Europe for patients at the highest risk (with elevated cardiac 
      biomarkers) and must take into account the increased risk of major bleeding. 
      Although routine coagulation monitoring is not required, an understanding of 
      which assays are appropriate for each non-VKA OAC and how they are affected is 
      important. In a bleeding emergency, non-specific prohaemostatic agents are 
      suggested to reverse the action of the non-VKA OACs, but more clinical data are 
      needed. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Non-VKA OACs provide similar or improved 
      efficacy and, on current evidence, improved safety. They provide greater 
      convenience, compared with traditional anticoagulants for the prevention of 
      stroke in patients with AF. Rivaroxaban may be of benefit to selected high-risk 
      patients with ACS. Selection of the most appropriate non-VKA OAC will depend on 
      individual patient factors.

TI  - Anticoagulation: a GP primer on the new oral anticoagulants.
PG  - 254-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The acceptability of warfarin has been limited by mandatory 
      laboratory monitoring. A number of new orally active anticoagulants (NOACs), 
      which can be used as alternatives to warfarin, are now available. OBJECTIVE: We 
      review the clinical indications and considerations associated with the use of the 
      NOACs. DISCUSSION: The NOACs currently approved in Australia are dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban. Indications include thromboprophylaxis in non-valvular 
      atrial fibrillation and following hip and knee replacement surgery. Rivaroxaban 
      is also approved for treatment and secondary prevention of deep venous thrombosis 
      (DVT) and pulmonary embolus (PE). The NOACs differ from warfarin in that they do 
      not require laboratory monitoring. They need to be used cautiously in patients 
      with renal impairment and are contraindicated in patients with renal failure. 
      Bleeding may require blood product replacement aided by haematological advice and 
      specialist investigations. Antidotes to the NOACS are undergoing clinical trials.

TI  - Phase III studies on novel oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation: a look beyond the excellent results.
PG  - 1979-87
LID - 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2012.04866.x [doi]
AB  - In this overview we address the three phase III studies that compared new oral 
      anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban) with warfarin in the 
      setting of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Strengths and weaknesses of 
      the studies were examined in detail through indirect comparison. We analyze and 
      comment the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the characteristics of randomized 
      patients, the primary efficacy and safety end points and side effects. All new 
      oral anticoagulants resulted in being non-inferior to vitamin K antagonists in 
      reducing stroke or systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. 
      Dabigatran 150 mg and apixaban were superior to vitamin K antagonists. 
      Importantly, new oral anticoagulants significantly reduced hemorrhagic stroke in 
      all three studies. Major differences among new oral anticoagulants include the 
      way they are eliminated and side effects. Both dabigatran and apixaban were 
      tested in low- to moderate-risk patients (mean CHADS2 [Congestive heart failure, 
      Hypertension, Age, Diabetes, Stroke] score = 2.1-2.2) whereas rivaroxaban was 
      tested in high-risk patients (mean CHADS2 score = 3.48) and at variance with 
      dabigatran and apixaban was administered once daily. Apixaban significantly 
      reduced mortality from any cause. The choice of a new oral anticoagulant should 
      take into account these and other differences between the new drugs.

TI  - [New oral anticoagulants: better than vitamin K antagonists?].
PG  - 1571-81
LID - 10.1007/s00108-010-2725-z [doi]
AB  - Many years of practical use and intensive scientific research have allowed 
      vitamin K antagonists to become a cornerstone of treatment of internal diseases. 
      Nevertheless, limitations in pharmacokinetics and -dynamics of vitamin K 
      antagonists and the availability of new drugs in regard to a targeted 
      anticoagulation therapy ask for a new review of the situation. Proof of 
      effectiveness for the perioperative prophylaxis of venous thrombosis after hip 
      and knee replacement has already been achieved for the direct thrombin inhibitor 
      dabigatran etexilate as well as for the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban und 
      apixaban compared to low molecular weight heparins. These new drugs are now also 
      investigated in patients with internal diseases. For the long-term application (6 
      or 12 months) concerning the treatment of venous thrombosis and/or stroke 
      prophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation data is already available for 
      the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate. Depending on its dosage its 
      effectiveness in comparison with vitamin K antagonists is equal or even better 
      without disadvantages in safety. However, vitamin K antagonists will remain the 
      standard oral anticoagulation until open questions regarding e.g. insufficient 
      therapy adherence (with termination rates up to 20%) or problems with drug 
      interactions of the new competitive products have been completely answered.

AB  - While parenteral anticoagulants such as unfractionated and low molecular weight 
      heparins and the oral vitamin K antagonists are effective for the prevention and 
      treatment of thrombosis, they have a number of limitations. Up until recently, 
      vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) have been the only available oral 
      anticoagulants. These drugs have a delayed onset of action, food and drug 
      interactions, and variable pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics such that regular 
      laboratory monitoring and dose adjustments are required to maintain the 
      International Normalized Ratio (INR) in the therapeutic range. New oral 
      anticoagulants that selectively inhibit either thrombin (dabigatran etexilate) or 
      factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban) have now gained approval in many countries for 
      some clinical indications. Unlike warfarin, these drugs have a rapid onset of 
      action and a relatively wide therapeutic range such that coagulation monitoring 
      is not required. These agents are more convenient for patients and health care 
      providers, but also have potential for improving clinical outcomes and being more 
      cost-effective than existing agents. This will result in major changes in the way 
      that thrombosis is managed, both with respect to prevention and treatment. The 
      new oral inhibitors of thrombin and factor Xa, however, have limitations and the 
      absence of a need for regular laboratory monitoring makes medication compliance 
      extremely important for maintaining efficacy given their relatively short 
      half-lives. Furthermore there will be challenges in managing patients on these 
      agents who develop recurrent thrombosis or major bleeding until methods to 
      monitor and assess the levels of the new agents are readily available and 
      specific antidotes are developed.

AB  - Vitamin K antagonists and heparins have been standard anticoagulation drugs over 
      the past decades. They are effective and safe but they have several drawbacks 
      which has led to the development of new oral anticoagulants. Dabigatran etexilate 
      is a specific oral thrombin inhibitor and rivaroxaban and apixaban are oral 
      inhibitors of factor Xa. These agents produce a predictable anticoagulant 
      response after fixed-dose administration so that routine coagulation monitoring 
      is unnecessary. Currently, dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban and apixaban are 
      licensed for thromboprophylaxis after elective total hip or knee replacement 
      surgery. Since august 2011, dabigatran etexilate is licensed for patients with 
      atrial fibrillation, rivaroxaban will follow. However, indications will be 
      expanded e.g. for therapy of venous thromboembolism. It is important to be aware 
      of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of these new agents. The 
      drugs considerably influence the global test of coagulation thus making an 
      interpretation of test results difficult. Currently, there is a lack of suitable 
      coagulation tests to monitor anticoagulation in emergency cases, such as 
      bleeding. Specific antidotes are not yet available.

TI  - Infigratinib Is a Reversible Inhibitor and Mechanism-Based Inactivator of 
      Cytochrome P450 3A4.
PG  - 856-868
LID - 10.1124/dmd.121.000508 [doi]
AB  - Infigratinib (INF) is a promising selective inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor 
      receptors 1-3 that has recently been accorded both orphan drug designation and 
      priority review status by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment 
      of advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Its propensity to undergo bioactivation to 
      electrophilic species was recently expounded upon. However, other than causing 
      aberrant idiosyncratic toxicities, these reactive intermediates may elicit 
      mechanism-based inactivation of cytochrome P450 enzymes. In this study, we 
      investigated the interactions between INF and the most abundant hepatic CYP3A. 
      Our findings revealed that, apart from being a potent noncompetitive reversible 
      inhibitor of CYP3A4, INF inactivated CYP3A4 in a time-, concentration- and 
      NADPH-dependent manner with inactivator concentration at half-maximum 
      inactivation rate constant, maximum inactivation rate constant, and partition 
      ratio of 4.17 µM, 0.068 minute(-1), and 41, respectively, when rivaroxaban was 
      employed as the probe substrate. Coincubation with testosterone (alternative 
      CYP3A substrate) or ketoconazole (direct CYP3A inhibitor) attenuated the rate of 
      inactivation, whereas the inclusion of glutathione and catalase did not confer 
      such protection. The lack of enzyme activity recovery after dialysis for 4 hours 
      and oxidation with potassium ferricyanide, coupled with the absence of the 
      characteristic Soret peak signature collectively substantiated that inactivation 
      of CYP3A4 by INF was not mediated by the formation of quasi-irreversible 
      metabolite-intermediate complexes but rather through irreversible covalent 
      adduction to the prosthetic heme and/or apoprotein. Finally, glutathione trapping 
      and high-resolution mass spectrometry experimental results unraveled two 
      plausible bioactivation mechanisms of INF arising from the generation of a 
      p-benzoquinonediimine and epoxide reactive intermediate. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: 
      The potential of INF to cause MBI of CYP3A4 was unknown. This study reports the 
      reversible noncompetitive inhibition and irreversible covalent MBI of CYP3A4 by 
      INF and proposes two potential bioactivation pathways implicating 
      p-benzoquinonediimine and epoxide reactive intermediates, following which a 
      unique covalent docking methodology was harnessed to elucidate the structural and 
      molecular determinants underscoring its inactivation. Findings from this study 
      lay the groundwork for future investigation of clinically relevant drug-drug 
      interactions between INF and concomitant substrates of CYP3A4.

TI  - Rivaroxaban does not increase hemorrhage after thrombolysis in experimental 
      ischemic stroke.
PG  - 495-501
LID - 10.1038/jcbfm.2013.226 [doi]
AB  - The management of acute ischemic stroke during anticoagulation with a novel oral 
      anticoagulant (NOAC) is challenging because intravenous thrombolysis is 
      contraindicated because of a putative increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhagic 
      complications. We examined the risk of secondary postischemic hemorrhage after 
      thrombolysis in rodents pretreated with rivaroxaban or warfarin. Mice were 
      pretreated with either rivaroxaban (30 mg/kg), warfarin (target international 
      normalized ratio 2 to 3) or vehicle. After 2 or 3 hours, middle cerebral artery 
      occlusion (MCAO), mice received 9 mg/kg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. 
      Twenty-four hours after MCAO, secondary hemorrhage was quantified using a 
      macroscopic hemorrhage score and hemoglobin spectrophotometry. Blood-brain 
      barrier (BBB) permeability was measured by Evans Blue spectrofluorometry. To 
      increase the validity of our findings, experiments were also performed using a 
      thromboembolic model in anticoagulated rats. Infarct size did not differ among 
      groups. Pretreatment with warfarin led to significantly more secondary hemorrhage 
      compared with rivaroxaban and nonanticoagulated controls after 2- and 3-hour 
      ischemia in mice as well as in rats. Blood-brain barrier permeability was 
      significantly higher in the warfarin group compared with rivaroxaban and control. 
      Thus, rivaroxaban in contrast to warfarin does not increase secondary hemorrhage 
      after thrombolysis in experimental cerebral ischemia. Less effects of rivaroxaban 
      on postischemic BBB permeability may account for this difference.

AB  - Anticoagulants can complicate the approach to the management of patients 
      undergoing operative interventions. We review new anticoagulants that have been 
      introduced recently to the market or that are undergoing investigations for 
      treatment of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism 
      prophylaxis: Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixiban, and edoxaban.

TI  - New oral anticoagulants vs. warfarin treatment: no need for pharmacogenomics?
PG  - 17-9
LID - 10.1038/clpt.2014.48 [doi]
AB  - For patients requiring long-term anticoagulation, oral vitamin K antagonists 
      (VKAs) such as warfarin have overwhelming efficacy data and present significant 
      challenges. In addition to the potential exposure to numerous drug-drug and 
      drug-food interactions, patients receiving warfarin require frequent monitoring. 
      It had been hoped that the integration of pharmacogenomic with clinical 
      information would improve anticoagulation control with warfarin, but trials have 
      not supported this aim. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer both advantages 
      and disadvantages and deserve consideration in appropriate patients.

TI  - Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modelling to Identify Pharmacokinetic 
      Parameters Driving Drug Exposure Changes in the Elderly.
PG  - 383-401
LID - 10.1007/s40262-019-00822-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication use is highly prevalent with advanced age, but clinical 
      studies are rarely conducted in the elderly, leading to limited knowledge 
      regarding age-related pharmacokinetic changes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this 
      study was to investigate which pharmacokinetic parameters determine drug exposure 
      changes in the elderly by conducting virtual clinical trials for ten drugs 
      (midazolam, metoprolol, lisinopril, amlodipine, rivaroxaban, repaglinide, 
      atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, clarithromycin and rifampicin) using our 
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) framework. METHODS: PBPK models for 
      all ten drugs were developed in young adults (20-50 years) following the best 
      practice approach, before predicting pharmacokinetics in the elderly (≥ 65 years) 
      without any modification of drug parameters. A descriptive relationship between 
      age and each investigated pharmacokinetic parameter (peak concentration [C(max)], 
      time to C(max) [t(max)], area under the curve [AUC], clearance, volume of 
      distribution, elimination-half-life) was derived using the final PBPK models, and 
      verified with independent clinically observed data from 52 drugs. RESULTS: The 
      age-related changes in drug exposure were successfully simulated for all ten 
      drugs. Pharmacokinetic parameters were predicted within 1.25-fold (70%), 1.5-fold 
      (86%) and 2-fold (100%) of clinical data. AUC increased progressively by 0.9% per 
      year throughout adulthood from the age of 20 years, which was explained by 
      decreased clearance, while C(max), t(max) and volume of distribution were not 
      affected by human aging. Additional clinical data of 52 drugs were contained 
      within the estimated variability of the established age-dependent correlations 
      for each pharmacokinetic parameter. CONCLUSION: The progressive decrease in 
      hepatic and renal blood flow, as well as glomerular filtration, rate led to a 
      reduced clearance driving exposure changes in the healthy elderly, independent of 
      the drug.

TI  - Beyond warfarin: the new generation of oral anticoagulants and their implications 
      for the management of dental patients.
PG  - 431-41
LID - 10.1016/j.oooo.2011.10.005 [doi]
AB  - Warfarin has been the primary anticoagulant drug used in the USA for more than 50 
      years. However, 2 novel types of oral anticoagulants have recently been approved 
      for use in the USA. These are direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., dabigatran 
      etexilate) and factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., rivaroxaban). Dental health care 
      providers may soon encounter patients who are being prescribed these medications. 
      This article describes the pharmacologic properties and medical uses of these new 
      oral anticoagulants. Also discussed are implications for the management of dental 
      patients being treated with these new oral anticoagulants, including potential 
      interactions with drugs commonly used or prescribed in the course of dental 
      treatment.

AB  - As limited amounts of data are available regarding thrombolytic therapy for 
      patients taking novel oral anticoagulants, thrombolytic therapy is not 
      recommended in such cases. Here, we report an acute stroke patient taking 
      rivaroxaban who received intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue 
      plasminogen activator (rt-PA). An 80-year-old man with a history of nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation, who had been receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban showed abrupt 
      onset of aphasia and right hemiparesis. National Institutes of Health Stroke 
      Scale score was 10. Onset of neurologic deficits occurred 4 hours after the last 
      dose of rivaroxaban. Clinical data on admission were as follows: blood pressure, 
      170/90 mm Hg; prothrombin time (PT), 22.6 seconds (control, 12.9 seconds); 
      international normalized ratio, 2.03; activated partial thromboplastin time, 46 
      seconds (normal, 23-32 seconds); and creatinine level, 1.11 mg/dL. Magnetic 
      resonance angiography revealed occlusion of the superior trunk of the left middle 
      cerebral artery. Intravenous infusion of .6 mg/kg of rt-PA (total dose, 36 mg) 
      was performed 6 hours after the last rivaroxaban administration with informed 
      consent. The neurologic deficit improved during infusion of rt-PA. Repeat brain 
      computed tomography showed left frontal cortical infarction without hemorrhagic 
      changes. In the case of rivaroxaban, it is difficult to accurately determine the 
      drug activity. As the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban can be estimated from 
      its pharmacokinetics and PT, it is clinically important to obtain accurate 
      information about the timing of medication and blood sampling.

AB  - The prevalence of obesity has increased substantially over recent years. 
      Clinicians are increasingly being challenged with making uncertain anticoagulant 
      dosing decisions, as the optimal dosing strategy for most anticoagulants in the 
      obese patient population remains unknown. Research published to date suggests 
      that the clearance of anticoagulants increases with weight. As obesity is 
      associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and arterial disease, 
      there is an urgent need to establish appropriate anticoagulation regimens for 
      this patient group. Research studies applying the method of 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation could establish an 
      appropriate evidence base and provide direction and reassurance to prescribing 
      clinicians.

AB  - Traditional therapeutic oral anticoagulation strategies often require invasive 
      dosing or monitoring. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have a large number of 
      interactions, delayed onset requires frequent dose monitoring, and they have a 
      small margin between therapeutic dose and bleeding complications. Novel oral 
      anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban, are being developed 
      to prevent those VKAs drawbacks. Besides oral bioavailability, those compounds 
      are designed to require minimal to no monitoring and have a favourable safety 
      profile. This review reports efficacy and safety data of these compounds 
      throughout clinical development, as well as new approaches for oral 
      pharmacological management of venous thromboembolism.

TI  - [Novel oral anticoagulants and atrial fibrillation in the elderly].
PG  - 34-40
LID - 10.1684/pnv.2013.0444 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation treatment relies on anticoagulation therapy that reduces the 
      risk of stroke. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) were the only oral anticoagulant 
      drugs for more than 50 years, but they are difficult to manage especially in the 
      elderly. In France, VKA are the main cause of iatrogenic hospitalizations with 
      about 17,000 hospitalizations per year and around 4,000 to 5,000 deaths per year. 
      Pharmacologic properties of VKA, especially the narrow therapeutic margin explain 
      the complexity of their management. Several studies have shown that patients 
      treated with VKA were on average only 50% of the time with an INR in the 
      therapeutic range. In other words, patients are, half of the time, either-under 
      treated or over-treated. Within this framework, development of new oral 
      anticoagulant drugs appeared necessary, in order to obtain drugs with larger 
      therapeutic margin and a better risk/benefit profile than VKA. Three large 
      randomized clinical trials including almost 50,000 patients with 20,000 subjects 
      over 75 years old and 8,000 over 80 years old, show a better risk/benefit profile 
      of the new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) than VKA, characterized by a 50% reduction 
      of cerebral hemorrhages, 22% reduction of stroke and 12% reduction of total 
      mortality. Meanwhile, their renal elimination and the lack of control of the 
      biological efficacy need to be taken into account for their prescription. Renal 
      failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate according to Cockcroft formula < 30 
      mL/min) contraindicates their use. Their half-life is shorter than that of VKA 
      and the biological monitoring is not available, thus a good adherence to the 
      treatment is important. Studies specifically conducted among geriatric older 
      population with poly-pathologies and frail are therefore needed to evaluate 
      tolerance of NOAC in real life conditions.

AB  - The direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, as well as the direct factor Xa 
      inhibtors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, display pharmacodynamic features 
      quite similar to low-molecular-weight heparins, with a time to peak level of 1-4 
      hours after oral administration, and a half-life between 5 and 14 hours. All 
      drugs display a linear relationship and a high degree of correlation between drug 
      levels in plasma, and the anticoagulant effect. Major differences are the extent 
      of renal elimination (with 80% or more for dabigatran, 66% for rivaroxaban [33% 
      unchanged, active drug, and 33% inactive metabolites], 33% for edoxaban, and 
      finally, 25% for apixaban), and bioavailability, which determines the amount of 
      drug required for attaining the target plasma concentration of the drug. Due to 
      the reliable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, no routine laboratory 
      monitoring is necessary, although dedicated laboratory assays are available for 
      emergencies and some other specific conditions.

TI  - Prevention and treatment of experimental thrombosis in rabbits with rivaroxaban 
      (BAY 597939)--an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor.
PG  - 471-7
AB  - Current anticoagulant therapies for the prevention and treatment of 
      thromboembolic disorders have many drawbacks: vitamin K antagonists interact with 
      food and drugs and require frequent laboratory monitoring, and heparins require 
      parenteral administration. Oral rivaroxaban (BAY 597939) is a new, highly 
      selective and potent direct factor-Xa (FXa) inhibitor with a predictable 
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile and could therefore be an attractive 
      antithrombotic drug. It was the objective of this study to investigate the 
      antithrombotic efficacy of oral rivaroxaban in two rabbit models of experimental 
      venous thrombosis. In the venous stasis (prevention) model, animals were 
      randomized to receive oral rivaroxaban 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 or 10.0 mg/kg or vehicle 
      control. Thrombosis was induced by jugular vein stasis and injection of 
      thromboplastin into the ear vein. In the venous thrombosis (treatment) model, 
      intravenous (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) and oral (3.0 mg/kg) rivaroxaban was compared 
      with intravenous nadroparin (40 U bolus and 20 U/h), fondaparinux (42 microg/kg) 
      and vehicle control. Thrombus growth was assessed by measuring the accretion of 
      radiolabelled fibrinogen into preformed clots in the jugular veins. Bleeding was 
      assessed using an ear bleeding model. In the prevention model, rivaroxaban 
      reduced thrombus formation dose-dependently (calculated ED(50) 1.3 mg/kg). In the 
      treatment model, oral rivaroxaban (3.0 mg/kg) reduced thrombus growth to a 
      similar extent to intravenous rivaroxaban (1.0 mg/kg), nadroparin and 
      fondaparinux. Oral rivaroxaban did not prolong bleeding time. In conclusion, the 
      orally available selective, direct FXa inhibitor rivaroxaban is effective in the 
      prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis in two well-established models of 
      experimental thrombosis.

TI  - Dabigatran and rivaroxaban use in atrial fibrillation patients on hemodialysis.
PG  - 972-9
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.014113 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dabigatran and rivaroxaban are new oral anticoagulants that are 
      eliminated through the kidneys. Their use in dialysis patients is discouraged 
      because these drugs can bioaccumulate to precipitate inadvertent bleeding. We 
      wanted to determine whether prescription of dabigatran or rivaroxaban was 
      occurring in the dialysis population and whether these practices were safe. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Prevalence plots were used to describe the point prevalence 
      (monthly) of dabigatran and rivaroxaban use among 29977 hemodialysis patients 
      with atrial fibrillation. Poisson regression compared the rate of bleeding, 
      stroke, and arterial embolism in patients who started dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or 
      warfarin. The first record of dabigatran prescription among hemodialysis patients 
      occurred 45 days after the drug became available in the United States. Since 
      then, dabigatran and rivaroxaban use in the atrial fibrillation-end-stage renal 
      disease population has steadily risen where 5.9% of anticoagulated dialysis 
      patients are started on dabigatrian or rivaroxaban. In covariate adjusted Poisson 
      regression, dabigatran (rate ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-1.81; 
      P=0.0001) and rivaroxaban (rate ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.83; 
      P=0.04) associated with a higher risk of hospitalization or death from bleeding 
      when compared with warfarin. The risk of hemorrhagic death was even larger with 
      dabigatran (rate ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-2.68; P=0.006) and 
      rivaroxaban (rate ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-3.12; P=0.07) 
      relative to warfarin. There were too few events in the study to detect meaningful 
      differences in stroke and arterial embolism between the drug groups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      More dialysis patients are being started on dabigatran and rivaroxaban, even when 
      their use is contraindicated and there are no studies to support that the 
      benefits outweigh the risks of these drugs in end-stage renal disease.

AB  - New oral anticoagulants, soon available in clinical practice, will deeply change 
      the management of venous thromboembolism. The main advantage of these drugs is 
      the route of administration. Moreover, among the new oral anticoagulants, 
      rivaroxaban has a better efficacy than enoxaparin to prevent thromboembolic 
      events after major orthopaedic surgery (THR and TKR). In phase III studies, 
      safety profile seems adequate. A new era for prophylaxis of VTE is beginning with 
      the new oral anticoagulants. However, improvement in the management of patients 
      with renal failure, obese patients or elderly is needed considering that these 
      patients have a high thrombotic and/or hemorrhagic risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this article is to summarize the published 
      literature concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral 
      anticoagulant drugs that are currently available for clinical use and other 
      aspects related to their management. METHODS: We carried out a standard review of 
      published articles focusing on the laboratory and clinical characteristics of the 
      vitamin K antagonists; the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran etexilate; and 
      the direct factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban RESULTS: The antithrombotic effect of 
      each oral anticoagulant drug, the interactions, and the monitoring of 
      anticoagulation intensity are described in detail and discussed without providing 
      specific recommendations. Moreover, we describe and discuss the clinical 
      applications and optimal dosages of oral anticoagulant therapies, practical 
      issues related to their initiation and monitoring, adverse events such as 
      bleeding and other potential side effects, and available strategies for reversal. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There is a large amount of evidence on laboratory and clinical 
      characteristics of vitamin K antagonists. A growing body of evidence is becoming 
      available on the first new oral anticoagulant drugs available for clinical use, 
      dabigatran and rivaroxaban.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently available anticoagulants utilized for venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) treatment and prevention and stroke prevention in patients 
      with atrial fibrillation (AF) have proven effectiveness but are not optimally 
      utilized because of barriers such as the need for subcutaneous administration and 
      requisite routine laboratory monitoring. Rivaroxaban, a novel oral Xa inhibitor, 
      is an alternative to standard therapies utilized for VTE prevention after 
      elective orthopedic surgery, primary and secondary stroke prevention in 
      nonvalvular AF, VTE treatment after an acute VTE event, and secondary prevention 
      after the acute coronary syndromes (ACS). OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the 
      pharmacology, efficacy, and tolerability of rivaroxaban for VTE prophylaxis in 
      post-orthopedic surgery and medically ill patients, stroke prevention in 
      nonvalvular AF, adjunctive therapy in patients with ACS, and VTE treatment. 
      METHODS: International Pharmaceutical Abstracts and EMBASE were searched for 
      English-only clinical trials and reviews published between 1970 and March 15, 
      2012. PubMed was searched for articles published between 1970 and June 30, 2012. 
      Additional trials and reviews were identified from the citations of published 
      articles. RESULTS: Eighty-nine publications were identified: 10 clinical trials 
      and 1 meta-analysis were used to obtain efficacy and tolerability data, and 1 
      analysis of pooled data from the clinical trials was included; 17 
      pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and drug-drug interaction studies were 
      included; and 5 cost-analyses were reviewed. These data showed rivaroxaban to be 
      noninferior to enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis of VTE after total knee and 
      total hip replacement surgery. It was also shown to be noninferior to vitamin K 
      antagonist therapy for primary and recurrent stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF 
      as well as for the treatment of VTE after an acute deep vein thrombosis or 
      pulmonary embolism. It also showed benefit in lowering the risk for major adverse 
      cardiovascular events after ACS. Differences in major bleeding rates were not 
      statistically significant between rivaroxaban and comparators across the various 
      studies, with the exception of ACS, in which there were higher rates of 
      non-coronary artery bypass graft surgery related bleeding and intracranial 
      hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of the studies reported in this 
      review, rivaroxaban is an effective option for the prevention of VTE after 
      orthopedic surgery, stroke prevention for nonvalvular AF, and treatment of VTE. 
      At this time, rivaroxaban cannot be recommended for secondary risk reduction 
      after ACS because of the increased bleeding risk.

TI  - Primary prevention of ischaemic stroke in atrial fibrillation: new oral 
      anticoagulant drugs for all?
PG  - 373-83
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) confers a 4.5% risk of stroke per year. The risk of 
      stroke increases with various risk factors and until recently, warfarin has been 
      the gold standard of thromboembolism prophylaxis in AF for many years. The dosage 
      of warfarin requires regular adjustment dependent on the INR, to keep within a 
      narrow therapeutic range of 2.0- 3.0. The INR can be altered by concomitant 
      drugs, foods and alcohol and requires inconvenient blood monitoring. 
      Underanticoagulation places patients at risk of stroke, whilst 
      over-anticoagulation confers significant bleeding risk. Consequently 
      approximately half who would benefit from oral anticoagulation do not have it 
      prescribed. Novel oral anticoagulants with predictable pharmacokinetics and 
      improved efficacy and safety profiles are currently being developed for stroke 
      prevention in AF. Three novel oral anticoagulants have just completed Phase III 
      trials for stroke prevention, all with impressive results; the direct thrombin 
      inhibitor, dabigatran and the oral factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban.

AB  - New oral factor Xa inhibitors are intended to progressively substitute the oral 
      vitamin K antagonists and parenteral indirect inhibitors of factor Xa in the 
      prevention and treatment of venous and arterial thromboembolic episodes. This 
      article focuses on the main clinical studies and on biological measurements of 
      new oral factor Xa inhibitors, and addresses several safety issues. These newer 
      agents do not require any routine laboratory monitoring of blood coagulation; 
      however, biological tests have been developed in order to assess the plasma 
      concentration of these drugs in several clinical settings. This article reviews 
      these 4 oral direct factor Xa inhibitors.

      patients.
PG  - 575-82
LID - 10.1160/TH13-09-0803 [doi]
AB  - During the past four years the phase III trials on stroke prophylaxis in atrial 
      fibrillation and on treatment of venous thromboembolism have been completed for 
      four new oral anticoagulants - dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban. 
      The studies have revealed advantages in terms of a reduced risk of bleeding, most 
      importantly of intracranial bleeding. These anticoagulants also have favourable 
      pharmacokinetics, eliminating the need for routine laboratory monitoring and dose 
      adjustments. There are, however, some differences between the drugs in certain 
      subsets of patients, according to patient characteristics or to indication for 
      treatment. These features are reviewed here. The management of patients in 
      association with invasive procedures or major bleeding is also discussed. 
      Finally, a strategy of how to select patients for warfarin or the new 
      anticoagulants and thereafter possibly also among the latter is outlined.

AB  - Anticoagulants have exhibited a critical role in the prevention and/or treatment 
      of thrombotic diseases. Up to now, kinds of novel oral anticoagulants, inhibiting 
      plasma serine proteases in the coagulation cascade, have been developed to 
      overcome the clinical limitations of classical anticoagulants (like warfarin and 
      heparins). Some of them, such as Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, Edoxaban, and Dabigatran, 
      have been approved by FDA in recent years. This review summarizes the discovery 
      and optimization of representative novel oral anticoagulants with the aim to 
      improve selectivity and bioavailability of compounds. The impact of different 
      targets in the cascade on bleeding risk also is discussed. We hope some more 
      effective, selective, and safer anticoagulants can be developed in the future on 
      the basis of these design experiences.

PG  - 61-70
LID - 10.3810/hp.2013.02.1011 [doi]
AB  - For > 50 years, vitamin K antagonists were the only available oral drugs for the 
      prevention of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. Recently, new 
      oral anticoagulants (the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the direct 
      activated factor X (factor Xa) inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban) have 
      completed phase 3 clinical trials for the same indications. The direct factor Xa 
      inhibitor apixaban was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 
      December 2012. In this article, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the 
      safety and efficacy of the new oral anticoagulants. We focus primarily on the 
      balance between thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risk and the implications of such 
      risks in clinical practice. Bleeding and thromboembolic risk estimation tools and 
      their roles in the correct utilization of new oral anticoagulation are also 
      discussed.

TI  - Adjusted indirect comparison of new oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in 
      atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 949-57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vit-K antagonists are the therapy of choice to prevent thromboembolic 
      events due to atrial fibrillation since many years. New oral anticoagulants (NOA) 
      showed encouraging results vs. warfarin but there are no data directly comparing 
      different NOA. We performed an adjusted indirect meta-analysis. METHODS: 
      Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched. Efficacy end points were the 
      cumulative rate of thomboembolic stroke (TES) and systemic embolism (SE). Main 
      safety end point was the rate of hemorrhagic stroke (HS). RESULTS: Three RCTs 
      (50578 patients) were included. Overall, NOA were comparable to warfarin 
      according to the cumulative risk of TES and SE, as well as for TES alone. NOA 
      were associated with a reduced rate of SE [OR 0.64 (0.44, 0.94], P=0.02]. 
      Compared to warfarin, NOA were associated with a significantly reduced risk of HS 
      [OR 0.43 (0.34, 0.55), P<0.001, NNT to avoid a HS 153] and all cause death [OR 
      0.90 [0.84, 0.96], P=0.03, NNT to save one fatality 43]. Head to head comparison 
      showed that in terms of cumulative rate of TES/SE, as well as of TES, none of the 
      NOA was significantly superior to the others (all Ps>0.05). Rivaroxaban showed 
      superiority in the prevention of SE. Dabigatran 150 mg/twice daily was associated 
      with the largest reduction in the risk of HS vs. warfarin and vs. other NOA. 
      Overall mortality was quite comparable across NOA. CONCLUSION: Overall 
      superiority of NOA over warfarin is largely influenced by the reduction of HS. 
      Dabigatran 150 mg/twice daily seems to have the best risk/benefit profile.

AB  - The new direct-acting oral anticoagulants (ACOD) in patients on prolonged 
      treatment require the need to balance the risk of haemorrhage by administering 
      them against the risk of thrombosis on withdrawing them. Recommendations for 
      their management are proposed in the present article: A) Thromboprophylaxis and 
      general anaesthesia: the performing of regional anaesthesia if administered with 
      an ACOD as thromboprophylaxis requires some safety intervals based on their 
      pharmacokinetic parameters; B) Management of ACOD in elective surgery: in 
      patients with normal renal function and a low haemorrhage/thrombosis risk, stop 
      the ACOD two days before the surgery; it the haemorrhage/thrombosis risk is high 
      and/or renal function is impaired, therapy with a low molecular weight heparin is 
      proposed from 5 days prior to the surgery, and C) Management of ACOD in urgent 
      surgery and associated haemorrhage: the systematic prophylactic administration of 
      haemostatics is recommended. In the event of acute bleeding that may place the 
      life of the patient at risk (due to volume or location), the administration of 
      concentrated prothrombin complex, fresh plasma, or factor VIIa, must be assessed, 
      together with general control measures of acute haemorrhage. These 
      recommendations should be considered in the context of the use drugs that do have 
      a specific antidote, where their monitoring by the usual coagulation tests is not 
      routine, and with those in which there is limited experience. We believe they 
      need to be reviewed in the future, depending on further studies and clinical 
      experience obtained.

AB  - New oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been developed that may further decrease the 
      mortality and morbidity of ACS by complementing antiplatelet therapy. Optimal use 
      of these agents can be achieved by maximum reduction in thrombotic events at the 
      minimum bleeding risk when combining a long-term oral anticoagulant with 
      anti-platelet therapy in patients with coronary heart disease. Although, based on 
      the pharmacokinetics and -dynamics of NOACs, these agents could improve the 
      current management of ACS patients, multiple trials consistently demonstrate a 
      trend toward increased major and clinically relevant non major bleeding almost 
      diminishing the benefits in reduction of ischemic events. Therefore, some 
      critical issues need to be further evaluated in future trials.

AB  - New oral anticoagulants (NOAC) are becoming available as alternatives to warfarin 
      to prevent systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation 
      and for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism. An in-depth 
      understanding of their pharmacology is invaluable for appropriate prescription 
      and optimal management of patients receiving these drugs should unexpected 
      complications (such as bleeding) occur, or the patient requires urgent surgery. 
      The Australasian Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis has set out to inform 
      physicians on the use of the different NOAC based on current available evidence 
      focusing on: (i) selection of the most suitable patient groups to receive NOAC, 
      (ii) laboratory measurements of NOAC in appropriate circumstances and (iii) 
      management of patients taking NOAC in the perioperative period, and strategies to 
      manage bleeding complications or 'reverse' the anticoagulant effects for urgent 
      invasive procedures.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) intra- and inter-individual 
      variability was previously reported, but its magnitude is still considered 
      negligible for patient management. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate inter- and 
      intra-individual variability in real-world atrial fibrillation patients on 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban in four Italian anticoagulation clinics and 
      to assess the correlation between DOAC plasma concentration and 
      creatinine-clearance (CrCl). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 330 consecutive 
      patients were enrolled, of which 160 were on dabigatran (70 and 90 taking 150 mg 
      or 110 mg twice-daily, respectively), 71 on rivaroxaban (37 and 34 taking 20mg or 
      15 mg once-daily) and 99 on apixaban (73 and 26 taking 5mg or 2.5mg twice-daily). 
      Blood was taken at trough and peak within the first month (15-25 days) of 
      treatment. Diluted-thrombin-time (dTT) calibrated for dabigatran and anti-FXa 
      calibrated for rivaroxaban or apixaban was performed. RESULTS: Mean 
      inter-individual variability expressed as overall CV values for all drugs was 
      lower at peak (CV=46%) than at trough (CV=63%). Mean CV% intra-individual 
      variability was 36.6% at trough and 34.0% at peak. Correlation with CrCl was poor 
      for all drugs and only dabigatran at trough showed a significant correlation. 
      CONCLUSION: This multicenter study confirms high DOAC inter-individual 
      variability that cannot be explained by the rate of renal clearance to which the 
      three DOAC were subjected since the correlation with CrCl was relatively poor. 
      This poor correlation suggests caution in using CrCl as the sole laboratory 
      parameter to indirectly evaluate residual circulating DOAC.

TI  - Effects of rivaroxaban on myocardial mitophagy in the rat heart.
PG  - 301-308
LID - 10.5606/tgkdc.dergisi.2023.24385 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of rivaroxaban's 
      pharmacokinetic effects on myocardial mitophagy in rats by inducing apoptosis. 
      METHODS: In this double-blind experiment, Wistar albino male rats were randomly 
      divided into three groups for an experimental ischemia model: the sham group 
      (Group 1; n=7), the control group (Group 2; n=7), and the drug group (Group 3; 
      n=7). Rivaroxaban was perorally administered with gavage at 2 mg/ kg/day for 28 
      days in Group 3. The heart was surgically exposed, and ischemia was achieved by 
      compressing the vessel around the proximal part of the left anterior descending 
      coronary artery for 10 min. The heart tissue was then transected, removed, and 
      morphologically and immunohistochemically examined under a light microscope. 
      RESULTS: Heart sections were immunohistochemically marked with caspase 3, caspase 
      9, APAF1, and Bcl-2 antibodies. Group 1 was compared to the rivaroxaban-treated 
      group, and the pathways inducing apoptosis was increased (caspase 3, caspase 9, 
      APAF1; p<0.015, p<0.004, and p<0.01, respectively) and Bcl-2, the molecule that 
      inhibits apoptosis, was decreased (p<0.01) in Group 3. CONCLUSION: The present 
      study provides an evidence that the mitophagy response is less in 
      rivaroxaban-treated rats, showing the protective effect of rivaroxaban against 
      acute ischemia. Rivaroxaban-treated rats may have reduced cell death in 
      cardiomyocytes during myocardial infarction and thus have reduced damage to the 
      heart tissue caused by myocardial infarction.

TI  - Antithrombotic triple therapy and coagulation activation at the site of thrombus 
      formation: a randomized trial in healthy subjects.
PG  - 1850-60
LID - 10.1111/jth.12726 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with acute coronary syndrome and concomitant atrial 
      fibrillation may require antithrombotic triple therapy but clinical evidence of 
      safety and efficacy is poor. We have therefore studied the combination of 
      different antithrombotic medicines for coagulation activation in an in vivo model 
      in the skin microvasculature. METHODS AND RESULTS: Platelet activation 
      (β-thromboglobulin [β-TG]) and thrombin generation (prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 
      [F1+2 ], thrombin-antithrombin complex [TAT]) were studied in an open-label, 
      randomized, parallel group trial in 60 healthy male subjects (n = 20 per group) 
      who received ticagrelor and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in combination with 
      dabigatran (150 mg bid), rivaroxaban (20 mg od) or phenprocoumon (INR 2.0-3.0). 
      Coagulation biomarkers in shed blood were assessed at 3 h after monotherapy with 
      the medicines under study, at 3 h after triple therapy dosing and at steady state 
      trough conditions. Single doses of ticagrelor, dabigatran or rivaroxaban caused 
      comparable decreases in shed blood β-TG and were more pronounced than 
      phenprocoumon at an INR of 2.0-3.0. In contrast, thrombin generation was more 
      affected by rivaroxaban and phenprocoumon than by dabigatran. During triple 
      therapy a similarly sustained inhibition of platelet activation and thrombin 
      generation with a maximum decrease of β-TG, F1+2 and TAT at 3 h post-dosing was 
      noted, which remained below pre-dose levels at trough steady state. CONCLUSION: A 
      triple therapy at steady state with ticagrelor plus ASA in combination with 
      dabigatran or rivaroxaban is as effective as a combination with phenprocoumon for 
      platelet activation and thrombin generation in vivo.

AB  - Vitamin K antagonists are currently the most frequently used anticoagulants. 
      However, practical limitations of their application, such as variability in dose 
      response, a narrow therapeutic index and numerous drug and dietary interactions, 
      have lead to development of new oral anticoagulants with better efficacy and 
      safety profile. Recent advances included the development of orally active FXa 
      inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban. Rivaroxaban received its marketing approval 
      in September 2008. Apixaban has recently been approved for prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism after total hip or knee replacement. This review describes the 
      pharmacological properties of apixaban and discusses the latest findings from 
      clinical trials.

TI  - Preventing stroke and systemic embolism in renal patients with atrial 
      fibrillation: focus on anticoagulation.
PG  - 81-91
LID - 10.1159/000346726 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease and atrial fibrillation (AF) commonly coexist, and data 
      suggest that renal patients have AF rates in excess of double that encountered in 
      the general population. These patients are at increased risk of stroke, 
      regardless of the presence or absence of AF. Furthermore, a lower GFR causes 
      increased thromboembolic risk in patients with AF - independent of other risk 
      factors. The dilemma facing clinicians treating this cohort of patients is that 
      renal insufficiency confers both a thromboembolic and a bleeding risk. Renal 
      disease also commonly coexists with other risk factors for stroke and bleeding 
      such as hypertension and advanced age. Furthermore, bleeding risk tracks stroke 
      risk and many risk factors are common to both thromboembolism and haemorrhage. 
      Patients with severe renal impairment are also actively excluded from the 
      majority of trials for stroke prevention in AF, including those trials which 
      informed the development of stroke risk factor scoring schemes. Therefore, 
      patients with renal disease and AF present a unique management challenge. The 
      available data suggests that the benefit from warfarin in terms of stroke 
      reduction is not as clear as in the general population, and there is an increased 
      risk of bleeding complications and even ectopic vascular calcification. Thus, it 
      is problematic to extrapolate the benefits of warfarin in the general population 
      to a subgroup that has been actively excluded from clinical trials. The new oral 
      anticoagulants have relatively little data in patients with severe renal 
      impairment, and all have an element of renal excretion. There is a need for large 
      randomised control trials in patients with renal insufficiency and on 
      haemodialysis to provide a bank of high-quality scientific data on which 
      clinicians can base their management decisions. Until then, we must adopt a 
      pragmatic approach which involves careful consideration of the relative risk of 
      stroke and bleeding in each individual patient.

      and antiretroviral medications.
PG  - 734-40
LID - 10.1177/1060028014523115 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review potential drug interactions between antiretroviral (ARV) 
      medications and antiplatelets or novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs). DATA SOURCES: 
      A literature search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical 
      Abstracts, and Google Scholar was performed using the search terms (1) 
      clopidogrel or ticagrelor or prasugrel, (2) dabigatran or rivaroxaban or 
      apixaban, and (3) antiretrovirals. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Any 
      English language study or case report describing a drug interaction between an 
      ARV and an antiplatelet or NOAC was included. Additional information was taken 
      from pharmacokinetic studies of individual agents alone or information from 
      similar drug interactions. RESULTS: Two studies were identified through the 
      literature search: one reporting an in vivo interaction between ritonavir and 
      prasugrel and the other an in vitro interaction between efavirenz and 
      clopidogrel. A case report describing a drug interaction between nevirapine and 
      rivaroxaban was also located. Information from pharmacokinetic studies and from 
      similar drug interactions allowed for a comprehensive review of potential drug 
      interactions. CONCLUSIONS: There are potential drug interactions between ARVs, 
      antiplatelet agents or NOACs. Management of these interactions may include 
      selecting ARVs with a lower potential for drug interactions or choosing 
      antiplatelet agents or NOACs least likely to interact with ARVs. With protease 
      inhibitors or cobicistat, clopidogrel and dabigatran do not appear to have 
      clinically significant interactions. Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase 
      inhibitors have a low potential for interactions with prasugrel and dabigatran. 
      Clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely to occur between 
      antiplatelet agents or NOACs and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
      raltegravir, dolutegravir, or maraviroc.

TI  - Transferability of Published Population Pharmacokinetic Models for Apixaban and 
      Rivaroxaban to Subjects with Obesity Treated for Venous Thromboembolism: A 
      Systematic Review and External Evaluations.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics15020665 [doi]
LID - 665
AB  - Apixaban and rivaroxaban have first-line use for many patients needing 
      anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The pharmacokinetics of these 
      drugs in non-obese subjects have been extensively studied, and, while changes in 
      pharmacokinetics have been documented in obese patients, data remain scarce for 
      these anticoagulants. The aim of this study was to perform an external validation 
      of published population pharmacokinetic (PPK) models of apixaban and rivaroxaban 
      in a cohort of obese patients with VTE. A literature search was conducted in the 
      PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase databases following the PRISMA statement. 
      External validation was performed using MonolixSuite software, using 
      prediction-based and simulation-based diagnostics. An external validation dataset 
      from the university hospitals of Brest and Rennes, France, included 116 apixaban 
      pharmacokinetic samples from 69 patients and 121 rivaroxaban samples from 81 
      patients. Five PPK models of apixaban and 16 models of rivaroxaban were included, 
      according to the inclusion criteria of the study. Two of the apixaban PPK models 
      presented acceptable performances, whereas no rivaroxaban PPK model did. This 
      study identified two published models of apixaban applicable to apixaban in obese 
      patients with VTE. However, none of the rivaroxaban models evaluated were 
      applicable. Dedicated studies appear necessary to elucidate rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics in this population.

PG  - 180-187
LID - 10.1002/rth2.12039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is concern amongst clinicians that the fixed dosing strategy of 
      rivaroxaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) might not be 
      optimal in those patients under or overweight. OBJECTIVE: To develop a 
      pharmacokinetic model for rivaroxaban, based on real-world patients, specifically 
      focusing on the impact of patients' body weight on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics. 
      PATIENTS/METHODS: One hundred and one patients prescribed rivaroxaban 
      prophylactic or treatment doses for the prevention or treatment of VTE were 
      recruited at a London teaching hospital. Subjects had up to 3 rivaroxaban 
      concentrations measured during a single dosing period (trough, 1 and 3 hours post 
      dose). Population pharmacokinetic analyses was conducted to develop a rivaroxaban 
      model, which was subsequently evaluated. RESULTS: A one-compartment model with 
      between-subject variability on rivaroxaban clearance and volume of distribution, 
      with a combined (additive and proportional) error model, best fitted the data. 
      Following a full covariate analysis, creatinine clearance on rivaroxaban 
      clearance was found to be the significant covariate impacting on the 
      pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban in the dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      suggest that the most important covariate impacting on rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetics is creatinine clearance and the weight alone has little effect. 
      These findings are in line with previous studies for rivaroxaban. Larger 
      datasets, from real-world patients who are followed longitudinally, should be 
      conducted to provide front-line clinicians with further reassurance when 
      prescribing rivaroxaban for the acute management of VTE.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in children using physiologically based and 
      population pharmacokinetic modelling: an EINSTEIN-Jr phase I study.
PG  - 32
LID - 10.1186/s12959-018-0185-1 [doi]
LID - 32
AB  - BACKGROUND: The EINSTEIN-Jr program will evaluate rivaroxaban for the treatment 
      of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children, targeting exposures similar to the 
      20 mg once-daily dose for adults. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) 
      model for pediatric rivaroxaban dosing has been constructed. METHODS: We 
      quantitatively assessed the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single rivaroxaban dose in 
      children using population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modelling and assessed the 
      applicability of the PBPK model. Plasma concentration-time data from the 
      EINSTEIN-Jr phase I study were analysed by non-compartmental and PopPK analyses 
      and compared with the predictions of the PBPK model. Two rivaroxaban dose levels, 
      equivalent to adult doses of rivaroxaban 10 mg and 20 mg, and two different 
      formulations (tablet and oral suspension) were tested in children aged 
      0.5-18 years who had completed treatment for VTE. RESULTS: PK data from 59 
      children were obtained. The observed plasma concentration-time profiles in all 
      subjects were mostly within the 90% prediction interval, irrespective of dose or 
      formulation. The PopPK estimates and non-compartmental analysis-derived PK 
      parameters (in children aged ≥6 years) were in good agreement with the PBPK model 
      predictions. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirmed the applicability of the 
      rivaroxaban pediatric PBPK model in the pediatric population aged 0.5-18 years, 
      which in combination with the PopPK model, will be further used to guide dose 
      selection for the treatment of VTE with rivaroxaban in EINSTEIN-Jr phase II and 
      III studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01145859; 
      registration date: 17 June 2010.

TI  - Rivaroxaban and other novel oral anticoagulants: pharmacokinetics in healthy 
      subjects, specific patient populations and relevance of coagulation monitoring.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/1477-9560-11-10 [doi]
AB  - Unlike traditional anticoagulants, the more recently developed agents 
      rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban target specific factors in the coagulation 
      cascade to attenuate thrombosis. Rivaroxaban and apixaban directly inhibit Factor 
      Xa, whereas dabigatran directly inhibits thrombin. All three drugs exhibit 
      predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics that allow for 
      fixed oral doses in a variety of settings. The population pharmacokinetics of 
      rivaroxaban, and also dabigatran, have been evaluated in a series of models using 
      patient data from phase II and III clinical studies. These models point towards a 
      consistent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile, even when extreme 
      demographic factors are taken into account, meaning that doses rarely need to be 
      adjusted. The exception is in certain patients with renal impairment, for whom 
      pharmacokinetic modelling provided the rationale for reduced doses as part of 
      some regimens. Although not routinely required, the ability to measure plasma 
      concentrations of these agents could be advantageous in emergency situations, 
      such as overdose. Specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics 
      must be taken into account when selecting an appropriate assay for monitoring. 
      The anti-Factor Xa chromogenic assays now available are likely to provide the 
      most appropriate means of determining plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban, and specific assays for dabigatran are in development.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have predictable pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics, limited potential for drug to drug interactions, and can be 
      given at fixed doses without the need for routine coagulation monitoring, which 
      makes them a very attractive alternative to vitamin K antagonists. DOACs act by 
      specifically targeting a single coagulation factor, such as Factor Xa or 
      thrombin. Rivaroxaban is a direct Factor Xa inhibitor and has been approved for 
      use in several thromboembolic disorders, such as the prevention of stroke and 
      systemic embolism in adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and the 
      prevention of recurrent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in adult 
      patients. This review aimed to provide an overview of the mechanism of action of 
      rivaroxaban and outline its pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, 
      metabolism, and excretion) in healthy adult subjects.

TI  - Investigation of Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Interactions Between 
      Rivaroxaban and Enoxaparin in Healthy Male Subjects.
PG  - 270-7
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.26 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban, an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor, is currently used in clinical 
      practice for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. This 
      single-center, three-way crossover study was designed to investigate the 
      pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban (10 mg) and enoxaparin (40 mg) alone and 
      in combination as well as the influence of enoxaparin on the pharmacokinetics of 
      rivaroxaban in healthy male subjects. When given alone, both drugs exhibited 
      similar, rapid anti-factor Xa activity. Combined administration resulted in an 
      increase of ∼50% in anti-factor Xa activity and a lesser increase in activated 
      partial thromboplastin time, compared with either drug alone. Enoxaparin had no 
      additional effect on prolongation of the prothrombin time induced by rivaroxaban 
      and did not affect the pharmacokinetic parameters of rivaroxaban. The results 
      showed that rivaroxaban (10 mg) and enoxaparin (40 mg) had a similar and rapid 
      onset of action, as indicated by the similar anti-factor Xa activity-time curves, 
      suggesting that both drugs have a similar duration of pharmacological activity at 
      the factor X site. Co-administration of rivaroxaban and enoxaparin is associated 
      with enhanced pharmacodynamic effects.

AB  - The use of warfarin, the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant, is being 
      questioned by clinicians worldwide due to warfarin several limitations (a limited 
      therapeutic window and significant variability in dose-response among 
      individuals, in addition to a potential for drug-drug interactions). Therefore, 
      the need for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) with a rapid 
      onset of antithrombotic effects and a predictable pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
      pharmacodynamic (PD) profile led to the approval of five new drugs: the direct 
      factor Xa (F-Xa) inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban (newly 
      approved by FDA) and the direct thrombin (factor-IIa) inhibitor dabigatran 
      etexilate. The advantages of NOACs over warfarin are a fixed-dosage, the absence 
      of the need for drug monitoring for changes in anti-coagulation and fewer 
      clinically significant PK and PD drug-drug interactions. NOACs exposure will 
      likely be increased by the administration of strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-inhibitors and may increase the risk of bleeds. On the 
      contrary, P-gp inducers could significantly decrease the NOACs plasma 
      concentration with an associated reduction in their anticoagulant effects. This 
      manuscript gives an overview of NOACs PK profiles and their drug-drug 
      interactions potential. This is meant to be of help to physicians in choosing the 
      best therapeutic approach for their patients.

LID - 10.1002/psp4.12103 [doi]
AB  - GCC-4401C, an orally active direct factor Xa inhibitor that is similar to 
      rivaroxaban, is currently under development for venous thromboembolic disease 
      (VTE). The purpose of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PKs) 
      and pharmacodynamics (PDs) of GCC-4401C by population modeling analysis and to 
      predict proper dosage regimens compared to rivaroxaban using data from two phase 
      I clinical studies. Plasma GCC-4401C concentrations over time were best described 
      by a two-compartment linear model and body weight was associated with central 
      volume of distribution. Relevant PD markers generally changed in a dose-dependent 
      manner and were described well with sigmoid, simple maximum effect, or linear 
      models. GCC-4401C was absorbed more rapidly than rivaroxaban. Comparisons based 
      on simulations of PD marker changes over time suggest that 20 mg and 40 mg of 
      GCC-4401C administered under fasted status are comparable to 10 mg and 20 mg of 
      rivaroxaban under fed status.

LID - 10.1007/s11239-013-0907-y [doi]
AB  - To simplify and optimize oral anticoagulation, new target-specific oral 
      anticoagulants (TSOAs) have been developed. The direct thrombin-inhibitor 
      dabigatran and the direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban 
      are the first such compounds to receive approval in certain countries for various 
      indications. Due to the predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles 
      of these drugs, routine monitoring of patients receiving TSOA therapy has not 
      been considered necessary. However, it has now been realized that in routine 
      clinical settings, there are several situations where it may be prudent to assess 
      the level of TSOA anticoagulation. Several studies evaluating the influence of 
      TSOAs on various coagulation assays have been performed to identify systems that 
      can be used to monitor these drugs. With a particular focus on dabigatran and 
      rivaroxaban, we will describe and discuss the potential of several methods for 
      measuring the anticoagulant effect of TSOAs, as well as their methodological 
      limitations and the restrictions in transferring their results into clinical 
      context.

TI  - Recommendations for the safe use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with 
      cirrhosis based on a systematic review of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and 
      safety data.

AB  - PURPOSE: The popularity of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is increasing among 
      patients with cirrhosis. Cirrhosis has a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of 
      drugs, potentially increasing adverse events. Safe use of drugs in cirrhosis 
      requires a diligent risk-benefit analysis. The aim of this study is to develop 
      practice recommendations for safe use of DOACs in cirrhosis based on a systematic 
      review of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety data. METHODS: We conducted 
      a systematic literature search to identify studies on pharmacokinetics, 
      pharmacodynamics and safety of DOACs in cirrhosis. Data were collected and 
      presented in summary tables by severity of cirrhosis using the 
      Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification. A multidisciplinary expert panel 
      evaluated the results and classified the DOACs according to safety. RESULTS: 
      Fifty four studies were included. All DOACs were classified as 'no additional 
      risks known' for CTP A. For CTP B, apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban were 
      classified as 'no additional risks known'. Apixaban and edoxaban showed fewer 
      adverse events in patients with cirrhosis, while dabigatran may be less impacted 
      by severity of cirrhosis based on its pharmacokinetic profile. Rivaroxaban was 
      classified as 'unsafe' in CTP B and C based on significant pharmacokinetic 
      alterations. Due to lack of data, apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban were 
      classified as 'unknown' for CTP C. CONCLUSION: DOACs can be used in patients with 
      CTP A cirrhosis, and apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban can also be used in CTP B. 
      It is recommended to avoid rivaroxaban in CTP B and C. There is insufficient 
      evidence to support safe use of other DOACs in CTP C cirrhosis.

AB  - Erdafitinib is a recently approved fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 
      inhibitor. It is the first treatment targeting susceptible FGFR genetic 
      alterations for patients with metastatic bladder cancer. A simple validated 
      HPLC-UV method was developed for the determination of erdafitinib in mouse 
      plasma. Erdafitinib and internal standard (rivaroxaban) were efficiently 
      separated on Eclipse plus C18 column (4.6 × 100 mm, 3.5 µm). The mobile phase 
      consisted of acetonitrile and 0.01 M ammonium acetate aqueous solution, adjusted 
      to pH 4.4 with acetic acid (26:74, v/v) and it was eluted isocratically at a flow 
      rate of 1.2 mL/min. The UV detection was at 292 nm and the total run time for 
      each sample was 11 min. The method linearity was validated over the range of 
      0.05-2.00 µg/mL (r(2) ≥ 0.9992) and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 
      0.05 µg/mL. The within-run and between-run accuracies were 98.56 and 99.24%, 
      respectively while the CV of the method precision did not exceed 6.52%. Plasma 
      samples were extracted using a solid phase extraction procedure and the 
      extraction recoveries were 97.90 ± 4.58%. The method was optimized for the 
      sensitive determination of the studied drug in mouse plasma and was successfully 
      applied to its pharmacokinetic studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thromboembolic disease is a potentially serious complication in 
      bariatric surgery patients. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have been 
      investigated in orthopedic surgery patients. DOAC data after bariatric surgery 
      are still limited to the early postsurgical period. Whether postsurgical midterm 
      adaptations due to anatomic and physiologic alterations influence drug 
      pharmacology is currently not known. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the influence of weight loss and type of bariatric surgery on midterm 
      postsurgical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of rivaroxaban. 
      SETTING: University hospital. METHODS: In this monocentric study, bariatric 
      patients received a single oral dose of rivaroxaban (10 mg) 6 to 8 months after 
      sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass (RYGB). Pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed and compared with prebariatric surgery 
      results. RESULTS: We included 6 RYGB and 6 SG patients. Percent excess weight 
      loss was 71.4% (interquartile range 56.4, 87.9) in the SG group and 76.6% (64.5, 
      85.7) in the RYGB group. Rivaroxaban mean areas under the curve 6 to 8 months 
      after the bariatric procedure (922.4 µg × h/L, coefficient of variation 43.2) 
      were comparable to those measured preoperatively (952.6 µg × h/L, 16.8). There 
      was no relevant difference between the 2 surgical procedure groups. Rivaroxaban 
      led to a decrease of prothrombin fragments F1+2 over 12 hours after oral intake 
      confirming in vivo efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Significant weight loss and altered 
      anatomy after RYGB and SG procedures do not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics 
      and pharmacodynamics of prophylactic rivaroxaban. A single dose of Rivaroxaban 
      was well tolerated and considered safe in this trial.

LID - 10.1055/s-0034-1370110 [doi]
AB  - Oral anticoagulants [Vitamin-K-Antagonists, Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban] or 
      antiplatelet agents [Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Prasugrel, Ticagrelor] are effective 
      in preventing thromboembolic diseases. In case of interventional of surgical 
      procedures patients with indications for chronic anticoagulation [atrial 
      fibrillation, valve prosthesis, venous thromboembolism] or use of antiplatelet 
      agents [cerebrovascular events, cardiovascular events] will require interruption 
      of antithrombotic/antiplatelet therapy with the need of replacement with a 
      short-acting agent. Due to limited data available from randomized studies and 
      meta-analyses the evidence level is low in the majority of recommendations. 
      Therefore for each patient the bleeding and thrombosis risk depending on the 
      individual patient constitution and the planned intervention must be weighted. In 
      patients with an intermediate risk for thrombosis the bleeding risk of the 
      scheduled intervention will influence the bridging recommendation: In patients 
      with a low bleeding risk oral anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy can be 
      continued or reduced in intensity. In patients with an intermediate or high 
      bleeding risk along with a low thrombosis risk a temporary interruption of the 
      anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy is feasible. In patients with a high 
      thrombosis and bleeding risk anticoagulation should be bridged with 
      unfractionated heparin [renal insufficiency] or low molecular weight heparin. In 
      the latter risk situation, inhibition of platelet function can be achieved with 
      short-lasting GPIIb-IIIa inhibitors [Eptifibatide, Tirofiban]. Prior to 
      intervention patients treated with the new oral anticoagulants [Dabigatran; 
      Rivaroxaban; Apixaban] are requested to temporary interrupt the anticoagulation 
      depending on the individual drug half-life and their renal function. Bridging 
      therapy with heparin prior to intervention is not necessary with the new oral 
      anticoagulants.

      dietary interactions that can be administered at fixed doses with no or minimal 
      monitoring. The recently approved oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, 
      along with the emerging oral anti-factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      and edoxaban, have been developed to address many of the shortcomings of warfarin 
      therapy. As warfarin is associated with extensive food and drug interactions, 
      there is also a need to consider such interactions with the new oral 
      anticoagulants. While to date few drug and dietary interactions have been 
      reported with the new oral anticoagulants, it is still early in their development 
      and clinical use cycle. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles will have to 
      be closely accounted for when determining the likelihood of a potential drug 
      interaction prior to therapy initiation. As the list of drugs and supplements 
      that interact with warfarin is continuously expanding, and the knowledge on drug 
      interactions with the novel oral anticoagulants is still in its infancy, 
      clinicians need to be vigilant when initiating any of these agents or when any 
      changes in the patient's medication profile occur and perform a close screening 
      for potential drug and dietary interactions. The objective of this paper is to 
      give an update on drug and dietary interactions with warfarin and the novel oral 
      anticoagulants, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

TI  - Effects of Verapamil and Diltiazem on the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
      of Rivaroxaban.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics11030133 [doi]
LID - 133
AB  - Concomitant use of rivaroxaban with non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers 
      (non-DHPs) might lead to an increase of systemic rivaroxaban exposure and 
      anticoagulant effects in relation to the inhibition of metabolic enzymes and/or 
      transporters by non-DHPs. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of 
      verapamil and diltiazem on the pharmacokinetics and the prolongation of 
      prothrombin time of rivaroxaban in rats. The data were analyzed using a 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) modeling approach to quantify the 
      influence of verapamil. Verapamil increased the systemic exposure of rivaroxaban 
      by 2.8-fold (p <0.001) which was probably due to the inhibition of efflux 
      transportation rather than metabolism. Prothrombin time was also prolonged in a 
      proportional manner; diltiazem did not show any significant effects, however. A 
      transit PK model in the absorption process comprehensively describes the 
      double-peaks of rivaroxaban plasma concentrations and the corresponding change of 
      prothrombin time with a simple linear relationship. The slope of prothrombin time 
      vs. rivaroxaban plasma concentration in rats was retrospectively found to be 
      insensitive by about 5.4-fold compared to than in humans. More than a 67% dose 
      reduction in rivaroxaban is suggested in terms of both a pharmacokinetic point of 
      view, and the sensitivity differences on the prolongation of prothrombin time 
      when used concomitantly with verapamil.

TI  - Comparative pharmacokinetics of two formulations of 2.5-mg rivaroxaban in healthy 
      Korean subjects.
LID - 10.5414/CP204335 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor used for the prevention 
      and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. The objective of this study was to 
      compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of two rivaroxaban formulations after a 
      single dose of rivaroxaban (2.5-mg tablet) in healthy Korean subjects. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: This study was a randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-period, 
      crossover study that included 34 healthy adult subjects under fasting conditions. 
      The test drug (Yuhan rivaroxaban tablet) or reference drug (Xarelto tablet) was 
      administered in each period. Serial blood samples were collected up to 36 hours 
      post-dose. Plasma concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS. Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters, including maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the 
      plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable 
      concentration (AUC(t)), were determined by non-compartmental analysis. The 90% 
      confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio of the geometric means of C(max) and 
      AUC(t) for the test drug/reference drug were calculated to evaluate 
      pharmacokinetic equivalence. RESULTS: A total of 28 subjects were included in the 
      pharmacokinetic analysis. The geometric mean ratios (90% CI) of the test 
      drug/reference drug for rivaroxaban were 1.0140 (0.9794 - 1.0499) for AUC(t) and 
      0.9350 (0.8797 - 0.9939) for C(max). All adverse events (AEs) were mild, and 
      there was no significant difference in the incidence of AEs between the 
      formulations. CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetic parameters of rivaroxaban were 
      compared between the test and reference drug, and both formulations were 
      bioequivalent. The newly developed rivaroxaban tablet is safe and well tolerated 
      as the reference drug (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT05418803).

AB  - The availability of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anti-coagulants alongside 
      vitamin K antagonists has offered a variety of options for anti-coagulation, but 
      has also necessitated a good understanding of the pharmacological properties of 
      each of these drugs prior to their use, to maximise the therapeutic benefit and 
      minimise patient harm Areas covered: This review article outlines the 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the currently licensed VKAs and 
      NOACs that are most commonly used in clinical practice, with the aim of 
      demonstrating how variations in these characteristics influence their use in 
      clinical practice. A literature search was conducted on PubMed using keywords and 
      relevant articles published by the 31(st) of December 2018 were included. Expert 
      opinion: The effect of a drug is determined by a combination of elements which 
      include patient characteristics and external factors, in addition to its 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. A good understanding of these is 
      essential. Despite the wealth of information available, particularly on VKAs, our 
      knowledge on the pharmacology responsible for certain drug effects and 
      inter-individual variations is still limited. Increasing efforts are being made 
      to understand these and include focus on pharmacogenomics and drug transporter 
      proteins.

AB  - Patients with deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism are recommended to 
      receive anticoagulation for acute treatment and secondary prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE). Fast-acting direct oral anticoagulants, with or without 
      parenteral heparin, have the potential to replace vitamin K antagonists in this 
      setting. Rivaroxaban, a direct Factor Xa inhibitor, is approved in the European 
      Union and the United States for the single-drug treatment of deep vein thrombosis 
      and pulmonary embolism and the secondary prevention of recurrent VTE in adults. 
      The approved rivaroxaban dose schedule (15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks followed by 
      20 mg once daily) was derived based on pharmacological data from the clinical 
      development programme to achieve a strong antithrombotic effect in the acute 
      treatment phase and address the need to balance efficacy and bleeding risk for 
      long-term treatment with a once-daily dose in the maintenance phase. Data from 
      dose-ranging studies, pharmacokinetic modelling and randomised phase III trials 
      support the use of this regimen. Other direct oral anticoagulants have also shown 
      favourable efficacy and safety compared with standard treatment, and apixaban 
      (European Union) and dabigatran (European Union and United States) have been 
      approved in this indication. There are practical aspects to rivaroxaban use that 
      must be considered, such as treatment of patients with renal and hepatic 
      impairment, drug-drug interactions, monitoring of effect and management of 
      bleeding. This review discusses the derivation of the VTE treatment regimen for 
      rivaroxaban, summarises the clinical data for rivaroxaban and other direct oral 
      anticoagulants in VTE treatment, and considers the practical aspects of 
      rivaroxaban use in this setting.

TI  - In vivo evaluation of the pharmacokinetic interactions between almonertinib and 
      rivaroxaban, almonertinib and apixaban.
PG  - 1263975

LID - 1263975
AB  - Background: Almonertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), is commonly used as a first-line treatment 
      for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR T790M mutations. 
      Rivaroxaban and apixaban are a selective, direct factor Xa inhibitor used to 
      treat venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is a frequent complication of NSCLC. 
      Rivaroxaban and apixaban are substrates of CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP, whereas 
      almonertinib is an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. Rivaroxaban or apixaban are often 
      prescribed together with almonertinib in NSCLC patients, but clear information on 
      pharmacokinetic drug interaction is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to 
      unravel the extent of interactions between almonertinib-rivaroxaban and 
      almonertinib apixaban in rats, and whether the pharmacokinetic interaction can be 
      mitigated by rivaroxaban and apixaban dose adjustment. Methods: Rats were divided 
      into ten groups (n = 6) that received rivaroxaban (2 mg/kg) (group 1), apixaban 
      (0.5 mg/kg) (group 2), almonertinib (15 mg/kg) (group 3, group 4), almonertinib 
      with rivaroxaban (2 mg/kg) (group 5), almonertinib with rivaroxaban (1 mg/kg) 
      (group 6), almonertinib with apixaban (0.5 mg/kg) (group 7), almonertinib with 
      apixaban (0.25 mg/kg) (group 8), rivaroxaban (2 mg/kg) with almonertinib (group 
      9), apixaban (0.5 mg/kg) with almonertinib (group 10). The concentrations of 
      drugs were determined by an ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
      spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The levels of messenger RNA were determined using 
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results and 
      Discussion: The results indicate that almonertinib increased the C(max) and 
      AUC(0-t) of 2 mg/kg rivaroxaban by 3.30 and 3.60-fold, 1 mg/kg rivaroxaban by 
      1.28 and 1.90-fold. Almonertinib increased the C(max) and AUC(0-t) of 0.5 mg/kg 
      apixaban by 2.69 and 2.87-fold, 0.25 mg/kg apixaban by 2.19 and 2.06-fold. In 
      addition, rivaroxaban also increased systemic exposure to almonertinib. The 
      results of qRT-PCR showed that almonertinib reduced the expression of Cyp3a1 in 
      liver and intestine, and Abcb1a, Abcg2 in intestine and kidney. The 
      pharmacokinetic results suggest that it is important to take special care of the 
      interactions of these drugs in clinical applications.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants have become increasingly used for atrial fibrillation 
      and venothromboembolic disease. Thus far, there have been a few published cases 
      of pericardial effusion associated with rivaroxban. However, there has been 
      little published regarding the effects of concurrent medications and their effect 
      on the cytochrome enzyme systems involved in rivaroxaban metabolism. We present a 
      case of a 76-year-old female who develops a spontaneous haemopericardium after 
      initiating rivaroxaban. After thorough medical reconciliation, we offer 
      pharmacokinetic mechanisms that may have contributed to the haemopericardium. 
      This case demonstrates the importance of reviewing patients medication lists and 
      utilizing basic pharmacokinetics to prevent adverse events.

      10-mg Rivaroxaban Tablets: A 4-Period Crossover Trial.
PG  - 920-926
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.1261 [doi]
AB  - This study compared the safety, bioequivalence, and pharmacokinetic properties of 
      2 formulations of 10-mg rivaroxaban tablets in healthy Chinese participants in 
      fasting and fed arms. The trial was an open, randomized, 4-period, replicated 
      crossover scheme, and 36 volunteers were recruited separately for the fasting and 
      fed arms. Volunteers were randomly administered a single dose of the test or 
      reference formulation (10 mg) orally, followed by a 5-day washout period. 
      Rivaroxaban concentrations in the plasma were determined using liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      obtained from the concentration-time profiles. The mean values of the test and 
      the reference product for the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 
      time 0 to the last measurable concentration, area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity, and maximum plasma 
      concentration were 996 and 1014 ng • h/mL, 1024 and 1055 ng • h/mL, and 150 and 
      152 ng/mL in the fasting arm, respectively; the values were 1155 and 1167 ng • 
      h/mL, 1160 and 1172 ng • h/mL, and 202 and 193 ng/mL in the fed arm, 
      respectively. All the parameters were within acceptable limits in terms of 
      bioequivalence. No serious adverse events were observed. This study demonstrated 
      that the 2 rivaroxaban tablets were bioequivalent in healthy Chinese participants 
      under fasting and fed conditions.

TI  - Is a Lower Dose of Rivaroxaban Required for Asians? A Systematic Review of a 
      Population Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Analysis of Rivaroxaban.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics15020588 [doi]
LID - 588
AB  - Rivaroxaban has been widely used to prevent and treat various thromboembolic 
      diseases for more than a decade. However, whether a lower dose of rivaroxaban is 
      required for Asians is still debatable. This review aimed to explore the 
      potential ethnic difference in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) 
      characteristics between Asians and Caucasians. A systematic search was conducted 
      and twenty-four studies were identified, of which 10 were conducted on Asian 
      adults, 11 on predominantly Caucasian adults, and 3 on Caucasian pediatrics. The 
      apparent clearance (CL/F) of rivaroxaban in Caucasian adults with non-valvular 
      atrial fibrillation (6.45-7.64 L/h) was about 31-43% higher than that in Asians 
      (4.46-5.98 L/h) taking 10~20 mg rivaroxaban every 24 h. Moreover, there was no 
      obvious difference in CL/F among Japanese, Chinese, Thai, and Irani people. 
      Regarding PK/PD relationship, prothrombin time was linked to rivaroxaban 
      concentration in a linear or near-linear manner, and Factor Xa activity was 
      linked with the E(max) model. The exposure-response relationship was comparable 
      between Asians and Caucasians. Renal function has a significant influence on 
      CL/F, and no covariate was recognized for exposure-response relationship. In 
      conclusion, a lower dose of rivaroxaban might be required for Asians, and further 
      studies are warranted to verify this ethnic difference to facilitate optimal 
      dosing regimens.

TI  - Interactions between antiepileptic drugs and direct oral anticoagulants for 
      primary and secondary stroke prevention.
PG  - 359-376
LID - 10.1080/17425255.2024.2352466 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are the guideline-recommended 
      therapy for prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF) and venous 
      thromboembolism. Since approximately 10% of patients using antiepileptic drugs 
      (AED) also receive DOAC, aim of this review is to summarize data about drug-drug 
      interactions (DDI) of DOAC with AED by using data from PubMed until December 
      2023. AREAS COVERED: Of 49 AED, only 16 have been investigated regarding DDI with 
      DOAC by case reports or observational studies. No increased risk for stroke was 
      reported only for topiramate, zonisamide, pregabalin, and gabapentin, whereas for 
      the remaining 12 AED conflicting results regarding the risk for stroke and 
      bleeding were found. Further 16 AED have the potential for pharmacodynamic or 
      pharmacokinetic DDI, but no data regarding DOAC are available. For the remaining 
      17 AED it is unknown if they have DDI with DOAC. EXPERT OPINION: Knowledge about 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic DDI of AED and DOAC is limited and frequently 
      restricted to in vitro and in vivo findings. Since no data about DDI with DOAC 
      are available for 67% of AED and an increasing number of patients have a combined 
      medication of DOAC and AED, there is an urgent need for research on this topic.

TI  - In vitro assessment of inhibitory effects of kinase inhibitors on CYP2C9, 3A and

      anticoagulants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated 
      drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of kinase inhibitors with warfarin and 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). METHODS: An in vitro CYP probe substrate 
      cocktail assay was used to study the inhibitory effects of fifteen kinase 
      inhibitors on CYP2C9, 3A, and 1A2. Then, DDI predictions were performed using 
      both mechanistic static and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. 
      RESULTS: Linsitinib, masitinib, regorafenib, tozasertib, trametinib, and 
      vatalanib were identified as competitive CYP2C9 inhibitors (K(i) = 1.4, 1.0, 1.1, 
      3.8, 0.5, and 0.1 μM, respectively). Masitinib and vatalanib were competitive 
      CYP3A inhibitors (K(i) = 1.3 and 0.2 μM), and vatalanib noncompetitively 
      inhibited CYP1A2 (K(i) = 2.0 μM). Moreover, linsitinib and tozasertib were CYP3A 
      time-dependent inhibitors (K(I) = 26.5 and 400.3 μM, k(inact) = 0.060 and 0.026 
      min(-1), respectively). Only linsitinib showed time-dependent inhibition of 
      CYP1A2 (K(I) = 13.9 μM, k(inact) = 0.018 min(-1)). Mechanistic static models 
      identified possible DDI risks for linsitinib and vatalanib with 
      (S)-/(R)-warfarin, and for masitinib with (S)-warfarin. PBPK simulations further 
      confirmed that vatalanib may increase (S)- and (R)-warfarin exposure by 4.37- and 
      1.80-fold, respectively, and that linsitinib may increase (R)-warfarin exposure 
      by 3.10-fold. Mechanistic static models predicted a smaller risk of DDIs between 
      kinase inhibitors and apixaban or rivaroxaban. The greatest AUC increases 
      (1.50-1.74) were predicted for erlotinib in combination with apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban. Linsitinib, masitinib, and vatalanib were predicted to have a 
      smaller effect on apixaban and rivaroxaban AUCs (AUCR 1.22-1.53). No kinase 
      inhibitor was predicted to increase edoxaban exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      suggest that several kinase inhibitors, including vatalanib and linsitinib, can 
      cause CYP-mediated drug-drug interactions with warfarin and, to a lesser extent, 
      with apixaban and rivaroxaban. The work provides mechanistic insights into the 
      risk of DDIs between kinase inhibitors and anticoagulants, which can be used to 
      avoid preventable DDIs in the clinic.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: For over 60 years vitamin K antagonists have been the mainstay of 
      oral therapy for treatment and prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic 
      disease. The emergence of two new classes of orally administered anticoagulants, 
      direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors have drastically changed the landscape 
      in the management of these disease states. Betrixaban , an orally administered 
      direct factor Xa inhibitor, is entering a Phase III trial and undergoing 
      investigation for similar indications as apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban. 
      AREAS COVERED: The chemical development of betrixaban, pharmacokinetic 
      differences between betrixaban and currently available novel anticoagulants and 
      future considerations for clinical use. EXPERT OPINION: Betrixaban, the fifth 
      novel oral anticoagulant in line for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
      approval, possesses some unique pharmacokinetic characteristics in comparison 
      with the currently available novel anticoagulants, including limited renal 
      excretion, minimal metabolism through the cytochrome p450 system and a long 
      half-life. This pharmacokinetic profile may allow greater flexibility for use in 
      patients with poor renal function, offer the convenience of once daily dosing, 
      and exhibit less drug interactions. Betrixaban is currently being evaluated for 
      prophylaxis against venous thromboembolic disease (VTED) and the prevention of 
      stroke and systemic embolism associated with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, its 
      role in the management of acute VTED and acute coronary syndromes is yet to be 
      defined based on clinical data and evaluation. Of interest, a factor Xa decoy, 
      PRT4445, is currently under evaluation in conjunction with betrixaban, and may be 
      a universal reversal agent for all anticoagulants with anti-Xa activity. 
      Currently, there are no specific reversal agents for the novel anticoagulants. 
      The availability of an effective reversal agent would be very attractive for the 
      management of associated bleeding, bleeding due to trauma, or the need for 
      emergent surgery.

AB  - Anticoagulation for the prevention of stroke is an important aspect of the 
      management of atrial fibrillation. Novel anticoagulants including oral factor Xa 
      inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran 
      have emerged as important therapeutic treatment options for prevention of stroke 
      in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. These agents offer practical advantages over 
      traditional vitamin K antagonists, however an understanding of their individual 
      pharmacokinetic and other agent-specific differences is essential for identifying 
      appropriate candidates for therapy, and for selecting the appropriate agent that 
      will be effective and safe. Here, we review the pharmacokinetic process of oral 
      medication use, summarize the newer anticoagulants, their pharmacology, 
      individual pharmacokinetic features, and explore possible explanations for the 
      differences in bleeding outcomes observed in the clinical trials.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetics and Dose Optimization Based on Renal Function of 
      Rivaroxaban in Thai Patients with Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14081744 [doi]
LID - 1744
AB  - Low-dose rivaroxaban has been used in Asian patients with direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) eligible for atrial fibrillation (AF). However, there are 
      few pharmacokinetic (PK) data in Thai patients to support precise dosing. This 
      study aimed to develop a population PK model and determine the optimal 
      rivaroxaban doses in Thai patients. A total of 240 Anti-Xa levels of rivaroxaban 
      from 60 Thai patients were analyzed. A population PK model was established using 
      the nonlinear mixed-effect modeling approach. Monte Carlo simulations were used 
      to predict drug exposures at a steady state for various dosages. Proportions of 
      patients having rivaroxaban exposure within typical exposure ranges were 
      determined. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption best described 
      the data. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) and body weight significantly affected CL/F 
      and V/F, respectively. Regardless of body weight, a higher proportion of patients 
      with CrCl < 50 mL/min receiving the 10-mg once-daily dose had rivaroxaban 
      exposures within the typical exposure ranges. In contrast, a higher proportion of 
      patients with CrCl ≥ 50 mL/min receiving the 15-mg once-daily dose had 
      rivaroxaban exposures within the typical exposure ranges. The study’s findings 
      suggested that low-dose rivaroxaban would be better suited for Thai patients and 
      suggested adjusting the medication’s dose in accordance with renal function.

AB  - In recent years, the options for anticoagulant therapy have examined new direct 
      oral anticoagulants (DOACs) comprising direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) 
      and direct factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). These 
      agents represent further progress towards the ideal anticoagulant drug and thus 
      towards a safe and effective antithrombotic therapy. The ideal anticoagulant is 
      oral and has a wide therapeutic range, predictable pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics, a rapid onset of action, an available antidote, minimal side 
      effects, and minimal interactions with other drugs or food. This review addresses 
      the practical considerations for physicians in DOAC use, including indication, 
      dosage, monitoring, pharmacokinetic profile, drug-drug interaction, and reversal 
      of direct anticoagulation effects in case of bleeding.

TI  - Laboratory and Clinical Monitoring of Direct Acting Oral Anticoagulants: What 
      Clinicians Need to Know.
PG  - 236-248
LID - 10.1002/phar.1884 [doi]
AB  - The direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban, have favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      properties and equal or superior efficacy and an improved safety profile compared 
      with warfarin. Noted shortcomings with DOACs are shorter half-lives requiring 
      stricter adherence, lack of standardized laboratory monitoring, lack of 
      anticoagulation reversal agents, and loss of routine coagulation monitoring 
      leading to fewer patient-clinician interactions. This review addresses many of 
      these limitations including monitoring of DOACs for efficacy and toxicity, an 
      assessment of selected qualitative and quantitative tests, and development of 
      monitoring strategies for special populations. Coagulation monitoring is 
      generally recommended only in overdose situations, but once standardized assays 
      are readily available, they could be helpful to ensure efficacy, assess bleeding, 
      and aid in drug selection in a number of other patient scenarios. Coagulation 
      tests that may provide qualitative assessment include activated partial 
      thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and thrombin time. Methods with potential 
      utility for quantitative assessment of DOACs include plasma drug concentrations, 
      ecarin clotting time, dilute thrombin time, and anti-factor Xa concentrations. 
      Noncoagulation laboratory monitoring should include serum creatinine, liver 
      function tests, and complete blood counts. Clinical monitoring of the 
      DOAC-treated patient should include routine assessment of adherence, bleeding 
      risks, and drug interactions. Frequency of monitoring should be 1-3 months after 
      initiation and then at least every 6 months, with more frequent follow-up (i.e., 
      3 months) based on patient specific characteristics such as age, renal 
      impairment, hepatic impairment, and concomitant drug therapy. The authors provide 
      a practical tool to assist in DOAC monitoring and recommend that pharmacists 
      collaborate with physicians in selecting appropriate patients and tailoring 
      patient-specific monitoring plans.

AB  - The most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulants worldwide are the vitamin K 
      antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin. Factors affecting the pharmacokinetics of 
      VKAs are important because deviations from their narrow therapeutic window can 
      result in bleedings due to over-anticoagulation or thrombosis because of 
      under-anticoagulation. In addition to pharmacodynamic interactions (e.g., 
      augmented bleeding risk for concomitant use of NSAIDs), interactions with drugs, 
      foods, herbs, and over-the-counter medications may affect the risk/benefit ratio 
      of VKAs. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including Factor Xa inhibitors 
      (rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) and thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) are 
      poised to replace warfarin. Phase-3 studies and real-world evaluations have 
      established that the safety profile of DOACs is superior to those of VKAs. 
      However, some pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions are expected. 
      Herein we present a critical review of VKAs and DOACs with focus on their 
      potential for interactions with drugs, foods, herbs and over-the-counter 
      medications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, there are no direct comparisons of apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban, two new oral direct factor Xa inhibitors approved for management of 
      thromboembolic disorders. OBJECTIVE: Compare the pharmacokinetics and anti-factor 
      Xa activity (AXA) of apixaban and rivaroxaban. METHODS: In this randomized, 
      open-label, two-period, two-treatment crossover study, healthy subjects (N=14) 
      received apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily (BID) and rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily (QD) 
      for 4 days with a ≥4.5-day washout. Plasma samples were obtained for 
      pharmacokinetic and AXA assessments; parameters were calculated using 
      noncompartmental methods. RESULTS: Median time-to-maximum concentration was 2 
      hours for both compounds, and the mean half-life was 8.7 and 7.9 hours for 
      apixaban and rivaroxaban, respectively. Daily exposure, the area under the curve 
      (AUC(0-24)), appeared similar for rivaroxaban (1,094 ng · h/mL) and apixaban (935 
      ng · h/mL), whereas mean peak-to-trough plasma concentration ratio was 3.6-fold 
      greater for rivaroxaban (16.9) than apixaban (4.7). Coefficient of variation for 
      exposure parameters (AUC0-24, Cmax, Cmin) was 20%-24% for apixaban versus 29%-46% 
      for rivaroxaban. Peak AXA, AXA AUC(0-24), and AXA fluctuation were ~2.5-, 1.3-, 
      and 3.5-fold higher for rivaroxaban than apixaban, respectively. Trough 
      concentrations and AXA were lower for rivaroxaban (10 ng/mL and 0.17 IU/mL vs 17 
      ng/mL and 0.24 IU/mL for apixaban, respectively). Rivaroxaban exhibited a steeper 
      concentration-AXA response (slope: 0.0172 IU/ng vs 0.0134 IU/ng for apixaban, 
      P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Apixaban 2.5 mg BID demonstrated less intersubject 
      variability in exposure, lower AXA AUC, and higher trough and smaller 
      peak-to-trough fluctuations in plasma concentration and AXA, suggesting more 
      constant anticoagulation compared with rivaroxaban 10 mg QD. However, the 
      clinical impact of these differences on the relative efficacy and safety of 
      apixaban and rivaroxaban remains to be determined.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), namely apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban are being increasingly prescribed among the general population, as 
      they are considered to be associated to lower bleeding risk than classical 
      anticoagulants, and do not require coagulation monitoring. Likewise, DOACs are 
      increasingly concomitantly prescribed in patients with epilepsy taking, 
      therefore, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), above all among the elderly. As a result, 
      potential interactions may cause an increased risk of DOAC-related bleeding or a 
      reduced antithrombotic efficacy. The objective of the present review is to 
      describe the pharmacokinetic interactions between AEDs and DOACs of clinical 
      relevance. We observed that there are only few clinical reports in which such 
      interactions have been described in patients. More data are available on the 
      pharmacokinetics of both drugs classes which allow speculating on their potential 
      interactions. Older AEDs, acting on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, and especially on 
      CYP3A4, such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine are more likely to 
      significantly reduce the anticoagulant effect of DOACs (especially rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban). Newer AEDs not affecting significantly CYP or P-gp, such 
      as lamotrigine, or pregabalin are not likely to affect DOACs efficacy. Zonisamide 
      and lacosamide, which do not affect significantly CYP activity in vitro, might 
      have a quite safe profile, even though their effects on P-gp are not well-known, 
      yet. Levetiracetam exerts only a potential effect on P-gp activity, and thus it 
      might be safe, as well. In conclusion, there are only few case reports and 
      limited evidence on interactions between DOACs and AEDs in patients. However, the 
      overall evidence suggests that the interaction between these drug classes might 
      be of high clinical relevance and therefore further studies in larger patients' 
      cohorts are warranted for the future in order to better clarify their 
      pharmacokinetic and define the most appropriate clinical behavior.

TI  - Laboratory assessment of rivaroxaban: a review.

AB  - Research into new anticoagulants for preventing and treating thromboembolic 
      disorders has focused on targeting single enzymes in the coagulation cascade, 
      particularly Factor Xa and thrombin, inhibition of which greatly decreases 
      thrombin generation. Based on the results of phase III clinical trials, 
      rivaroxaban, a direct Factor Xa inhibitor, has been approved in many countries 
      for the management of several thromboembolic disorders. Owing to its predictable 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, fixed-dose regimens are used 
      without the need for routine coagulation monitoring. In situations where 
      assessment of rivaroxaban exposure may be helpful, anti-Factor Xa chromogenic 
      assays (in tandem with standard calibration curves generated with the use of 
      rivaroxaban calibrators and controls) could be used. It is important to note that 
      test results will be affected by the timing of blood sampling after rivaroxaban 
      intake. In addition, the anti-Factor Xa method measures the drug concentration 
      and not the intensity of the drug's anticoagulant activity, and a higher than 
      expected rivaroxaban plasma level does not necessarily indicate an increased risk 
      of bleeding complications. Therefore, clinicians need to consider test results in 
      relation to the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban and other patient risk factors 
      associated with bleeding.

AB  - Rivaroxaban (RIV) is a direct Factor Xa inhibitor anticoagulant, but the oral 
      bioavailability of RIV is estimated to be only 60% due to its poor solubility. 
      The aim of the present study was to improve the solubility and bioavailability of 
      RIV. Five cocrystals-p-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA), 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid 
      (DBA), nicotinamide (NA), isonicotinamide (IA), and succinic acid (SA)-were used 
      as cofomers and were successfully obtained and characterized by powder X-ray 
      diffraction, thermal analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectra. RIV-DBA 
      and RIV-HBA cocrystals showed obvious improvements in solubility, dissolution 
      (under sink conditions), and intrinsic dissolution rates versus RIV. Moreover, 
      the dissolution of RIV-HBA, RIV-DBA, and RIV-SA cocrystals under non-sink 
      conditions showed obvious "spring and parachute" patterns. The in vitro 
      permeability levels in a Caco-2 cell model of RIV-DBA and RIV-IA cocrystals were 
      significantly improved versus RIV. Pharmacokinetic studies in beagle dogs showed 
      that RIV-DBA and RIV-HBA cocrystals had higher bioavailability than RIV. The 
      enhancements in solubility and bioavailability indicate the potential of RIV 
      cocrystals as a better candidate for the treatment of thrombosis versus RIV.

AB  - Dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and a thienopyridine, such as 
      clopidogrel, is effective for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events 
      in patients with acute coronary syndrome, but there is still a substantial 
      residual risk of recurrence. Although anticoagulant therapy with a vitamin K 
      antagonist (e.g. warfarin) in conjunction with antiplatelet therapy has been 
      shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, the rates of bleeding were 
      increased with these combination therapies; hence, triple therapy with warfarin 
      is currently only recommended in patients at low risk of bleeding. In addition, 
      there are other limitations associated with vitamin K antagonist therapy, 
      including the need for routine coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment to 
      maintain the treatment within the therapeutic range. Rivaroxaban is an oral, 
      direct Factor Xa inhibitor; in clinical practice, it is likely that rivaroxaban 
      will be given to patients who also receive antiplatelet therapy, such as 
      clopidogrel. This randomized, non-blinded, three-way crossover study investigated 
      the effect of rivaroxaban on bleeding time when co-administered with clopidogrel. 
      In addition, the influence of clopidogrel on the safety, tolerability, 
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban was investigated. Of 27 
      healthy male subjects who received a single 300 mg dose of clopidogrel, 14 were 
      identified as clopidogrel responders and were then randomized to the following 
      three treatments: (A) two doses of clopidogrel on two consecutive days (300 mg on 
      day 1; 75 mg on day 2); (B) one dose of rivaroxaban (15 mg); or (C) a combination 
      of treatments A and B (rivaroxaban given on day 2). All treatments were well 
      tolerated. Bleeding time with co-administration of rivaroxaban and clopidogrel 
      was significantly prolonged in four subjects, compared with either drug alone: 
      combination treatment increased the overall least squares-means to 3.77 times 
      baseline (90% confidence interval [CI] 2.82-4.73), compared with 1.13 times 
      baseline (90% CI 0.17-2.09) with rivaroxaban and 1.96 times baseline (90% CI 
      0.10-2.91) with clopidogrel. Co-administration of clopidogrel had no significant 
      effect on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban and, when compared with rivaroxaban 
      alone, had no further effects on Factor Xa activity or prothrombin time. 
      Inhibition of ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation by clopidogrel was not affected 
      by rivaroxaban. As expected, owing to the mode of action of each study drug, the 
      results of this study demonstrated that co-administration of the Factor Xa 
      inhibitor rivaroxaban and the antiplatelet clopidogrel increased the bleeding 
      time in healthy subjects without affecting other pharmacokinetic or 
      pharmacodynamic parameters of each drug.

TI  - Effects of Carbamazepine and Phenytoin on Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
      of Rivaroxaban.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics12111040 [doi]
LID - 1040
AB  - Rivaroxaban (RIV) is commonly prescribed with carbamazepine or phenytoin 
      (CBZ/PHT) in post-stroke seizure or post-stroke epilepsy patients. Although 
      adverse events have been reported in several previous studies when they are 
      coadministered, there are no studies of the interactions between these drugs. 
      Therefore, our study was conducted to solve this lack of information. The 
      potential effects of CBZ/PHT were investigated by comparing the pharmacokinetic 
      (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of RIV between the control group (RIV 
      alone) and the test groups (RIV administered with CBZ/PHT) in rats using the 
      noncompartmental analysis (NCA) and the compartmental model approach. The NCA 
      results indicate that AUC(t) of RIV decreased by 57.9% or 89.7% and C(max) of RIV 
      decreased by 43.3% or 70.0% after administration of CBZ/PHT, respectively. In 
      addition, both CBZ and PHT generally reduced the effects of RIV on the 
      prothrombin times of the blood samples. PK profiles of RIV were most properly 
      described by a two-compartment disposition model with a mixed first- and 
      zero-order absorption kinetics and a first-order elimination kinetics. The 
      compartmental model approach showed that a 211% or 1030% increase in CL/F of RIV 
      and a 33.9% or 43.4% increase in D2 of RIV were observed in the test groups by 
      the effects of CBZ/PHT, respectively. In conclusion, CBZ and PHT significantly 
      reduced RIV exposure and therefore reduced the therapeutic effects of RIV. 
      Consequently, this might result in adverse events due to insufficient RIV 
      concentration to attain its therapeutic effects. Further studies are needed to 
      validate this finding.

TI  - New oral anticoagulants.
PG  - 310-20
LID - 10.1007/s11239-011-0559-8 [doi]
AB  - The new oral anticoagulants may prove to be one of the most significant 
      innovations in clinical practice in the past 60 years. Apixaban and rivaroxaban 
      are specific inhibitors of Factor Xa while dabigatran inhibits Factor IIa. The 
      predictable pharmacological profile of these new agents will allow physicians to 
      use these drugs without the need for routine coagulation monitoring which is the 
      mainstay of warfarin therapy. In addition, these new agents have not been shown 
      to have any food interactions and limited drug-drug interactions due to their 
      minimal metabolism through the CYP450 system. This unique pharmacokinetic profile 
      may usher in for clinicians a new era of managing thromboembolic disorders. In 
      this paper, the pharmacology of these new oral anticoagulants are reviewed along 
      with the major clinical trials in venous thromboembolism prevention in total hip 
      and knee replacement orthopedic surgery, the treatment of venous thromboembolic 
      disorders and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.

AB  - Cancer patients generally has a high risk of thrombotic diseases. However, 
      anticoagulant therapy always aggravates bleeding risks. Rivaroxaban is one of the 
      most widely used direct oral anticoagulants, which is used as anticoagulant 
      treatment or prophylaxis in clinical practice. The present study aimed to 
      systemically estimate the combination safety of rivaroxaban with tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors (TKIs) based on human cytochrome P450 (CYPs) and efflux transporters 
      and to explore the drug-drug interaction (DDI) mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. 
      In vivo pharmacokinetic experiments and in vitro enzyme incubation assays and 
      bidirectional transport studies were conducted. Imatinib significantly increased 
      the rivaroxaban C(max) value by 90.43% (p < 0.05) and the area under the curve 
      value by 119.96% (p < 0.01) by inhibiting CYP2J2- and CYP3A4-mediated metabolism 
      and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)- and P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated 
      efflux transportation in the absorption phase. In contrast, the combination of 
      sunitinib with rivaroxaban reduced the exposure in vivo by 62.32% (p < 0.05) and 
      the C(max) value by 72.56% (p < 0.05). In addition, gefitinib potently inhibited 
      CYP2J2- and CYP3A4-mediated rivaroxaban metabolism with K(i) values of 2.99 μΜ 
      and 4.91 μΜ, respectively; however, it almost did not affect the pharmacokinetics 
      of rivaroxaban in vivo. Taken together, clinically significant DDIs were observed 
      in the combinations of rivaroxaban with imatinib and sunitinib. Imatinib 
      increased the bleeding risks of rivaroxaban, while sunitinib had a risk of 
      reducing therapy efficiency. Therefore, more attention should be paid to aviod 
      harmful DDIs in the combinations of rivaroxaban with TKIs.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a frequent cause of stroke. Secondary prophylaxis by 
      oral anticoagulants (OAC) is recommended after stroke in AF-patients. OAC can be 
      achieved by vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs) or non-vitamin K antagonist oral 
      anticoagulants (NOACs) like dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban. 
      Seizures are frequent after stroke, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are indicated. 
      The review, based on a literature research, aims to give an overview about 
      pharmacokinetic knowledge and clinical data about drug-drug interactions (DDIs) 
      between NOACs and AED. Carbamazepine, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin and 
      valproic acid might decrease the effect of NOACs by inducing P-glycoprotein 
      (P-gp) activity. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and 
      topiramate might decrease the effect of NOACs by inducing CYP3A4 activity. 
      Controversial data - inhibition as well as induction of CYP3A4 - were found about 
      valproic acid. The relevance of these DDIs is largely unknown since there are 
      only sporadic case reports available. To increase the knowledge about DDIs 
      between NOACs and AEDs we suggest subgroup analyses addressing effects and safety 
      of VKAs versus NOACs in patients with AF on AEDs, in case they have been included 
      in previously completed or still ongoing trials or registries. This could be 
      easily feasible and would be desirable in view of the large data already 
      accumulated.

PG  - 387-397
LID - 10.1080/14712598.2019.1599355 [doi]
AB  - Andexanet alfa is a recombinant modified factor Xa protein that has been 
      developed to reverse factor Xa inhibitors. Since May 2018, the FDA has approved 
      its utilization in patients treated with apixaban and rivaroxaban in case of 
      life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. On 28 of February 2019, the Committee 
      for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted a positive opinion, recommending the 
      granting of a conditional marketing authorization for andexanet alfa in Europe. 
      Area covered: The authors provide an overview of andexanet alfa development and 
      its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The results of the clinical 
      phase III trial ANNEXA as well as current limitations related to andexanet alfa 
      are also discussed. Expert opinion: Although phase I and II studies have proven 
      that andexanet alfa can be effective in reversing the effect of factor Xa 
      inhibitors, its efficacy in major bleeding patients has only been shown for 
      apixaban and rivaroxaban, without any comparator group. Well-designed studies 
      comparing the efficacy and safety of andexanet alfa to other reversal strategies 
      are required to confirm preliminary data. The benefit of andexanet alfa in 
      specific settings needs to be investigated and its use in clinical practice needs 
      to be facilitated by the implementation of international guidelines.

AB  - Abstract Thrombosis is an underlying cause of many cardiovascular disorders, and 
      generation of thrombi in the arterial circulation can lead to unstable angina, 
      myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke. Antithrombotic therapy is widely used, 
      with proven benefit to prevent ischemic stroke and thromboembolic events in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or to prevent further ischemic 
      complications in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Traditional 
      anticoagulants (including unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, 
      and warfarin) and antiplatelet agents (including aspirin, clopidogrel, and 
      prasugrel) are typically used for these indications. Limitations to their use 
      include variable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, inability to 
      inhibit fibrin-bound thrombin, risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, delayed 
      onset of action, numerous drug interactions, need for substantial laboratory 
      monitoring and dosage titrations, hyporesponsiveness or resistance, 
      hypersensitivity, adverse events, and bleeding. To overcome some of the 
      limitations of traditional agents, new antithrombotic agents under development 
      are highly selective for specific coagulation factors blocking the synthesis of 
      thrombin. Clinicians must have an understanding of the new anticoagulants to aid 
      in the selection of appropriate therapies for patients. We describe the most 
      relevant phases II and III clinical trials that evaluated several recent emerging 
      anticoagulant drugs for use in patients with AF or ACS. The advantages of many 
      new agents include predictable pharmaco-dynamic response and pharmacokinetic 
      parameters, allowing for fixed oral dosing with no need for laboratory 
      monitoring. For patients with AF, dabigatran is already approved for the 
      prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, rivaroxaban appears to be an 
      effective alternative to warfarin in high-risk patients, and apixaban may also be 
      an effective alternative to aspirin in patients unable to take warfarin. 
      Otamixaban shows promise as an intravenous alternative for patients with ACS in 
      the acute care setting. Likewise, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and darexaban with or 
      without dual antiplatelet therapy may be beneficial for secondary prevention of 
      ischemic events in patients with ACS.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are first-line drugs used for the treatment of 
      venous thromboembolism and prevention of stroke in patients with atrial 
      fibrillation. These drugs do not require the regular biochemical monitoring that 
      is mandatory for warfarin, and they exhibit shorter half-lives and have a faster 
      onset of action. Since recent real-world studies evidence a higher prevalence of 
      adverse side effects than what was anticipated in clinical trials, monitoring the 
      plasma concentrations of DOACs is being used to personalize their 
      pharmacotherapy, in accordance to the characteristics of the patient, and to 
      evaluate the adherence to therapy. In order to fulfill the aforementioned 
      clinical unmet needs, there are specific coagulation assays that indirectly 
      assess the plasma concentrations of DOACs. Nevertheless, these assays are not 
      sufficiently accurate or sensitive. For this reason, liquid chromatography 
      techniques coupled to mass spectrometry detection, are considered the gold 
      standard method to accurately determine plasma concentrations of DOACs. 
      Therefore, the present paper provides the first comprehensive review of the 
      current analytical methods that were developed and validated for the quantitative 
      determination of apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and/or edoxaban and their main 
      metabolites in biological samples. The chromatographic methods will be 
      particularly highlighted and an emphasis will be placed on the major difficulties 
      faced during optimization and development steps. In addition, the 
      physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of each drug 
      will be critically related to chromatographic conditions. Their influence on the 
      pre-treatment procedures and storage conditions of DOACs will be examined, 
      suggesting strategies that should be applied to accurately quantify DOACs in 
      biological samples.

TI  - Current status of rivaroxaban in elderly patients with pulmonary embolism 
      (Review).
PG  - 2817-2825
LID - 10.3892/etm.2020.8559 [doi]
AB  - Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs with a high incidence rate in elderly 
      patients, demonstrating complex clinical manifestations, as well as a difficult 
      anticoagulant treatment strategy. Currently, there is limited understanding of 
      the selection criteria for anticoagulant treatment in elderly patients with PE. 
      In fact, the vitamin K antagonist warfarin, a commonly prescribed anticoagulant, 
      has multiple disadvantages, including a narrow therapeutic range, unpredictable 
      pharmacokinetics, multiple food and drug interactions and genetic polymorphisms 
      resulting in poor response to this therapy; therefore, routine laboratory 
      monitoring is required. Most elderly patients with PE fail to adhere to the 
      treatment regimen or even discontinue it, and clinicians are equally hesitant to 
      initiate oral anticoagulants in elderly patients with PE. This leads to a dilemma 
      regarding the use of anticoagulation therapies and a worse prognosis for the 
      patients. Rivaroxaban, a direct Xa factor inhibitor, has demonstrated 
      considerable practical and clinical advantages, exhibits fast-start action 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, and has an enhanced 
      predictable anticoagulant effect with fewer drug-drug interactions. Based on 
      randomized controlled trials and real-world clinical practice, rivaroxaban has 
      also been recognized as a safe and effective anticoagulant, and these advantages 
      have improved the therapeutic compliance of elderly patients with PE. Thus, this 
      review focused on the current status of rivaroxaban treatment for elderly 
      patients with PE, and described its significance in changing the current 
      anticoagulation treatment regimens for patients. It is expected that rivaroxaban 
      will become a good choice for the treatment of PE in elderly patients.

TI  - Novel oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation: which novel oral anticoagulant 
      for which patient?
PG  - 512-9
LID - 10.2459/JCM.0000000000000262 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation is the most common rhythm disorder and represents a major 
      public health problem because it carries an increased risk of arterial 
      thromboembolism and ischemic stroke. Current european society of cardiology 
      guidelines recommend to stratify atrial fibrillation patients according to the 
      CHA2DS2-VASc score and to administer anticoagulation, preferably with novel oral 
      anticoagulants, that is, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban, if the 
      CHA2DS2-VASc score is at least 1. All novel anticoagulants have shown the same, 
      if not greater, efficacy and safety as warfarin, with some advantages. The choice 
      among the novel oral anticoagulants depends on their different pharmacokinetic 
      profile, patients' stroke and bleeding risk, comorbidities, drug tolerability and 
      costs and, finally, patients' preferences.

TI  - Drug-Drug Interactions of FXI Inhibitors: Clinical Relevance.
PG  - 151-163
LID - 10.3390/hematolrep16010016 [doi]
AB  - Inhibitors of the factor FXI represent a new class of anticoagulant agents that 
      are facing clinical approval for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE), and stroke prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF). 
      These new inhibitors include chemical small molecules (asundexian and milvexian), 
      monoclonal antibodies (abelacimab, osocimab, and xisomab), and antisense 
      oligonucleotides (IONIS-FXIRX and fesomersen), and thus, they have very peculiar 
      and different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Besides their 
      clinical efficacy and safety, based on their pharmacological heterogeneity, the 
      use of these drugs in patients with comorbidities may undergo drug-drug 
      interactions (DDIs) with other concomitant therapies. Although only little 
      clinical evidence is available, it is possible to predict clinically relevant DDI 
      by taking into consideration their pharmacokinetic properties, such as the 
      CYP450-dependent metabolism, the interaction with drug transporters, and/or the 
      route of elimination. These characteristics may be useful to differentiate their 
      use with the direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) anti -FXa (rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      edoxaban) and thrombin (dabigatran), whose pharmacokinetics are strongly 
      dependent from P-gp inhibitors/inducers. In the present review, we summarize the 
      current clinical evidence on DDIs of new anti FXI with CYP450/P-gp inhibitors and 
      inducers and indicate potential differences with DOAC anti FXa.

AB  - The mechanism underlying large individual differences in the response to oral 
      anticoagulants has not been fully clarified, and the influence of the intestinal 
      microbiome on exogenous drug metabolism has gradually become an area of increased 
      research interest. However, there has been no research into the influence of the 
      gut microbiota on the pharmacokinetics of oral anticoagulants. Therefore, our 
      study is the first to investigate the effect of the intestinal flora on oral 
      anticoagulant metabolism and the associated mechanism. Antibiotics affected the 
      diversity and abundance of the intestinal flora. Compared with the control group, 
      the bioavailability of warfarin and rivaroxaban were significantly increased in 
      the amoxicillin-treated group, whereas the bioavailability of dabigatran 
      increased and subsequently decreased. Compared with the control group, the 
      expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and nuclear 
      receptor, PXR, were altered in the amoxicillin -treated groups. This trend was 
      consistent with the pharmacokinetic results. Changes in the intestinal flora can 
      affect the expression of liver drug enzymes and P-gp, as well as affect the 
      transport and metabolism of oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, dabigatracin, 
      and rivaroxaban), leading to differences in the efficacy of oral anticoagulants. 
      This study revealed a novel mechanism for influencing individual differences in 
      the treatment efficacy of oral anticoagulants.

AB  - Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin are the most commonly prescribed 
      oral anticoagulants worldwide. However, factors affecting the pharmacokinetics of 
      VKAs, such as food and drugs, can cause deviations from their narrow therapeutic 
      window, increasing the bleeding or thrombosis risk and complicating their 
      long-term use. The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) offers a safer and 
      more convenient alternative to VKAs. However, it is important to be aware that 
      plasma levels of DOACs are affected by drugs that alter the cell efflux 
      transporter P-glycoprotein and/or cytochrome P450. In addition to these 
      pharmacokinetic-based interactions, DOACs have the potential for pharmacodynamic 
      interaction with antiplatelet agents and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
      This is an important consideration in patient groups already at high risk of 
      bleeding, such as patients with renal impairment.

TI  - Co-Administration of Amiodarone Increases Bleeding by Affecting Rivaroxaban 
      Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics16081006 [doi]
LID - 1006
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the impact of the drug-drug interaction between 
      rivaroxaban and amiodarone on the clinical outcomes in patients with non-valvular 
      atrial fibrillation (NVAF), focusing on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      (PK/PD) aspects. A prospective study enrolling 174 patients with NVAF who were 
      treated with rivaroxaban was conducted. The patients were divided into two groups 
      based on postoperative antiarrhythmic and anticoagulation strategies: the 
      rivaroxaban group (Control group) and the rivaroxaban plus amiodarone group 
      (Riv/Amio group). The trough plasma concentrations (C(trough)) of rivaroxaban, 
      activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), and the 
      clinical outcomes between the two groups were compared. Patients receiving 20 mg 
      of rivaroxaban in the Riv/Amio group had a higher concentration of rivaroxaban 
      C(trough) than those in the Control group (p = 0.009). Furthermore, in patients 
      with moderate to severe renal impairment, rivaroxaban C(trough) was significantly 
      increased in the Riv/Amio group. There was no significant difference in PT and 
      APTT between the two groups. Regarding the clinical outcomes, the combination of 
      rivaroxaban and amiodarone medication was associated with a higher incidence of 
      bleeding events (p = 0.041; HR = 2.83, 95% CI 1.05-7.66) and clinically relevant 
      non-major bleeding (p = 0.021; HR = 3.65, 95% CI 1.21-10.94). Finally, 
      independent risk factors for bleeding in NAVF patients treated with rivaroxaban 
      were identified as its combination with amiodarone (p = 0.044; OR = 2.871, 95% CI 
      1.028-8.023). The combination of rivaroxaban and amiodarone led to changes in 
      rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and an elevated risk of bleeding events. Therefore, 
      physicians prescribing rivaroxaban medications should assess the potential 
      bleeding risk associated with the concurrent use of amiodarone, particularly in 
      patients with renal impairment.

TI  - Drug-Drug Interactions of Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs): From 
      Pharmacological to Clinical Practice.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14061120 [doi]
LID - 1120
AB  - The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and 
      edoxaban, are becoming the most commonly prescribed drugs for preventing ischemic 
      stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and for the 
      treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Rivaroxaban was also 
      recently approved for the treatment of patients with a recent acute coronary 
      syndrome (ACS). Their use demonstrated to have a favorable risk-benefit profile, 
      with significant reductions in stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality 
      compared to warfarin, but with increased gastrointestinal bleeding. Nevertheless, 
      their safety profile is compromised in multimorbidity patients requiring 
      contemporary administration of several drugs. Comorbidity and polypharmacy have a 
      high prevalence in elderly patients, who are also more susceptible to bleeding 
      events. The combination of multiple treatments can cause relevant drug-drug 
      interactions (DDIs) by affecting the exposure or the pharmacological activities 
      of DOACs. Although important differences of the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties 
      can be observed between DOACs, all of them are substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
      and thus may interact with strong inducers or inhibitors of this drug 
      transporter. On the contrary, rivaroxaban and, to a lower extent, apixaban, are 
      also susceptible to drugs altering the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP) 
      activities. In the present review, we summarize the potential DDI of DOACs with 
      several classes of drugs that have been reported or have characteristics that may 
      predict clinically significant DDIs when administered together with DOACs. 
      Possible strategies, including dosage reduction, avoiding concomitant 
      administration, or different time of treatment, will be also discussed to reduce 
      the incidence of DDI with DOACs. Considering the available data from specific 
      clinical trials or registries analysis, the use of DOACs is associated with fewer 
      clinically relevant DDIs than warfarin, and their use represents an acceptable 
      clinical choice. Nevertheless, DDIs can be significant in certain patient 
      conditions so a careful evaluation should be made before prescribing a specific 
      DOAC.

TI  - Apixaban. After hip or knee replacement: LMWH remains the standard treatment.
PG  - 201-2, 204
AB  - The standard anticoagulant for prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients 
      undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery is a low-molecular-weight heparin 
      (LMWH) such as subcutaneous enoxaparin. Apixaban is the second oral factor Xa 
      inhibitor, after rivaroxaban, to be approved in the European Union for use in 
      these two situations. Three double-blind randomised trials versus enoxaparin in a 
      total of nearly 12 000 patients failed to show that apixaban was more effective 
      in terms of relevant endpoints: mortality, and the incidence of pulmonary 
      embolism and symptomatic deep vein thrombosis. The incidence of bleeding did not 
      differ between the apixaban and enoxaparin groups under the conditions of these 
      trials. Apixaban is mainly metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP 3A4 and 
      3A5 and also binds to P-glycoprotein, resulting in a high potential for 
      pharmacokinetic interactions. Renal failure is a risk factor for overdose. 
      Pharmacodynamic interactions are also likely. There is no known antidote for 
      apixaban. In practice, LMWH remains the standard treatment.

TI  - Handling delayed or missed direct oral anticoagulant doses: model-informed 
      individual remedial dosing.
PG  - 5906-5916
LID - 10.1182/bloodadvances.2024013854 [doi]
AB  - Nonadherence to direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) pharmacotherapy may increase the 
      risk of thromboembolism or bleeding, and delayed or missed doses are the most 
      common types of nonadherence. Current recommendations from regulatory agencies or 
      guidelines regarding this issue lack evidence and fail to consider individual 
      differences. This study aimed to develop individual remedial dosing strategies 
      when the dose was delayed or missed for DOACs, including rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      edoxaban, and dabigatran etexilate. Remedial dosing regimens based on population 
      pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling and simulation strategies were 
      developed to expeditiously restore drug concentration or PD biomarkers within the 
      therapeutic range. Population PK-PD characteristics of DOACs were retrieved from 
      previously published literature. The effects of factors that influence PK and PD 
      parameters were assessed for their impact on remedial dosing regimens. A 
      web-based dashboard was established with R-shiny to recommend remedial dosing 
      regimens based on patient traits, dosing schedules, and delay duration. 
      Addressing delayed or missed doses relies on the delay time and specific DOACs 
      involved. Additionally, age, body weight, renal function, and polypharmacy may 
      marginally affect remedial strategies. The proposed remedial dosing strategies 
      surpass current recommendations, with less deviation time beyond the therapeutic 
      range. The online dashboard offers quick and convenient solutions for addressing 
      missed or delayed DOACs, enabling individualized remedial dosing strategies based 
      on patient characteristics to mitigate the risks of bleeding and thrombosis.

TI  - Direct-Acting Oral Anticoagulants in patients at extremes of body weight: a 
      review of pharmacological considerations and clinical implications.
PG  - e31-e41
LID - 10.1055/s-0043-1776989 [doi]
AB  - Patients at extremes of body weight are underrepresented in randomized controlled 
      trials of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Therefore, their optimal 
      anticoagulant treatment remains a topic of debate. The aim of this narrative 
      review is to summarize the evidence on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      profile of DOACs for treating patients at extremes of body weight in venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) and in the prevention of cardioembolic stroke in 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). A literature search was conducted in the 
      main bibliographic databases, and the most relevant reviews and original articles 
      on the topic were selected. Although data in these patient groups are limited, 
      apixaban and rivaroxaban show a favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      profile in obese VTE treatment and NVAF patients and, in the case of apixaban, 
      also in underweight patients. In particular, these drugs demonstrated comparable 
      efficacy and safety to standard therapy. Very few data were available for 
      dabigatran and edoxaban; the latter drug was safer at a lower dose, mainly in 
      underweight patients. Our findings are in line with the last International 
      Society of Haemostasis and Thrombosis position paper and European Heart Rhythm 
      Association 2021 practical guide, suggesting the use of apixaban and rivaroxaban 
      in morbidly obese patients (>120 kg or body mass index ≥40 kg/m (2) ) and the 
      reduced dosage of edoxaban in low-weight patients. Future studies should focus on 
      large populations of patients at extremes of body weights to acquire more 
      clinical and pharmacokinetic evidence on all available DOACs, especially those 
      currently less investigated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The EINSTEIN-Jr program will evaluate rivaroxaban for the treatment 
      of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children, targeting exposures similar to the 
      20 mg once-daily dose for adults. METHODS: This was a multinational, single-dose, 
      open-label, phase I study to describe the pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) and safety of a single bodyweight-adjusted rivaroxaban dose in children aged 
      0.5-18 years. Children who had completed treatment for a venous thromboembolic 
      event were enrolled into four age groups (0.5-2 years, 2-6 years, 6-12 years and 
      12-18 years) receiving rivaroxaban doses equivalent to 10 mg or 20 mg (either as 
      a tablet or oral suspension). Blood samples for PK and PD analyses were collected 
      within specified time windows. RESULTS: Fifty-nine children were evaluated. In 
      all age groups, PD parameters (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin 
      time and anti-Factor Xa activity) showed a linear relationship versus rivaroxaban 
      plasma concentrations and were in line with previously acquired adult data, as 
      well as in vitro spiking experiments. The rivaroxaban pediatric physiologically 
      based pharmacokinetic model, used to predict the doses for the individual body 
      weight groups, was confirmed. No episodes of bleeding were reported, and 
      treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in four children and all resolved 
      during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Bodyweight-adjusted, single-dose rivaroxaban had 
      predictable PK/PD profiles in children across all age groups from 0.5 to 
      18 years. The PD assessments based on prothrombin time and activated partial 
      thromboplastin time demonstrated that the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban was 
      not affected by developmental hemostasis in children. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01145859.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serious bleeding events have been frequently described in patients 
      taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC). In secondary analyses of phase 3 
      trials, DOAC plasma concentrations were shown to correlate with bleeding 
      outcomes. This study aimed to describe rivaroxaban plasma levels in patients 
      admitted to the emergency department (ED) for bleeding events. For each patient, 
      risk factors for experiencing bleeding events were also investigated. METHODS: 
      This analysis was part of an observational study conducted in the ED of two 
      teaching hospitals. Plasma samples from 10 rivaroxaban-treated patients admitted 
      for bleeding events were collected. Rivaroxaban plasma concentrations were 
      determined by calibrated chromogenic anti-Xa assay. The measured rivaroxaban 
      levels were then extrapolated at trough using a published population 
      pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model, and compared to on-therapy ranges observed in 
      large clinical trials. For each patient, clinical, medication and ABCB1 genotype 
      data were collected. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban measurements varied from 5 to 
      358 ng/ml, with a post-intake delay ranging from 9 to 38 h. At trough, estimated 
      plasma concentrations were between 12 and 251 ng/ml (median value 94 ng/ml). Four 
      patients had higher-than-expected rivaroxaban levels. Inadequate dose regimen, 
      excessive alcohol consumption and lack of treatment reassessment were observed in 
      several patients. Half of patients were taking ≥1 drug with potential 
      pharmacokinetics interactions (e.g. amiodarone, diltiazem), while half of 
      patients were taking ≥1 drug increasing the risk of bleeding. All 3 patients with 
      available genotyping data and higher-than-expected rivaroxaban levels were 
      heterozygous or homozygous mutated for the ABCB1 1236C > T, 2677G > T, 3435 C > T 
      and rs4148738 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). CONCLUSIONS: Rivaroxaban 
      patients admitted to the ED for bleeding events showed highly variable plasma 
      concentrations. This analysis underlines the usefulness of rapid DOAC measurement 
      and the value of PopPK models to estimate concentrations at trough in a context 
      where the post-intake delay is unmanageable. Close patient follow-up, including 
      renal function assessment and drug interactions review, is essential for bleeding 
      risk minimization.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Drug Monitoring of Direct-Acting Oral 
      Anticoagulants: Where Do We Stand?
PG  - 180-191
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000594 [doi]
AB  - For decades, oral anticoagulation has been based on vitamin K antagonist such as 
      warfarin, which requires pharmacodynamic (PD) drug monitoring to guide the 
      therapy. The drug effect is measured by the clotting test prothrombin time and 
      expressed as international normalized ratio. New direct oral anticoagulants are 
      increasingly used in fixed-dose regimens but are licensed without any therapy 
      monitoring. However, extensive clinical experiences have demonstrated that 
      interindividual variations in the response to the therapy with direct oral 
      anticoagulants do exist. In situations such as bleeding or thrombosis, 
      therapeutic drug monitoring could be useful. Unfortunately, global coagulation 
      assays such as the prothrombin time or the activated partial thrombin time are 
      not suitable for this purpose. To measure drug concentrations, more specific 
      coagulation test can be used if they are externally calibrated with the 
      respective drugs. For the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate, a 
      calibrated diluted thrombin time or ecarin clotting time can be used, whereas for 
      anti-factor Xa drugs such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban, 
      calibrated anti-factor Xa assays are appropriate. However, the gold standard to 
      measure drug concentrations is LC-MS/MS. The variation in bleeding and thrombotic 
      events noted with both drug classes under fixed-dose conditions suggests 
      additional interindividual PD differences. Therefore, PD monitoring to 
      individualize the therapy may be an option. For dabigatran, this is the 
      inhibition of thrombin formation and for anti-factor Xa drugs, the inhibition of 
      factor Xa activity, which can be followed using the functional assays mentioned 
      above but without calibration. Alternatively, thrombin generation assays have 
      been proposed for both drug classes. So far, not many clinical data have been 
      published about the potentially beneficial effects of PD monitoring for dose 
      individualization. The assay platforms for PD monitoring are present in many 
      clinical laboratories, but efforts are needed to validate and standardize 
      available assays to perform appropriate clinical trials.

TI  - Pharmacogenomics of Novel Direct Oral Anticoagulants: Newly Identified Genes and 
      Genetic Variants.
LID - 10.3390/jpm9010007 [doi]
LID - 7
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have shown an upward prescribing trend in 
      recent years due to favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics without 
      requirement for routine coagulation monitoring. However, recent studies have 
      documented inter-individual variability in plasma drug levels of DOACs. 
      Pharmacogenomics of DOACs is a relatively new area of research. There is a need 
      to understand the role of pharmacogenomics in the interpatient variability of the 
      four most commonly prescribed DOACs, namely dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      and edoxaban. We performed an extensive search of recently published research 
      articles including clinical trials and in-vitro studies in PubMed, particularly 
      those focusing on genetic loci, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and DNA 
      polymorphisms, and their effect on inter-individual variation of DOACs. 
      Additionally, we also focused on commonly associated drug-drug interactions of 
      DOACs. CES1 and ABCB1 SNPs are the most common documented genetic variants that 
      contribute to alteration in peak and trough levels of dabigatran with 
      demonstrated clinical impact. ABCB1 SNPs are implicated in alteration of plasma 
      drug levels of rivaroxaban and apixaban. Studies conducted with factor Xa, ABCB1, 
      SLCOB1, CYP2C9, and VKORC1 genetic variants did not reveal any significant 
      association with plasma drug levels of edoxaban. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
      interactions of dabigatran are mainly mediated by p-glycoprotein. Strong 
      inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and p-glycoprotein should be avoided in 
      patients treated with rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. We conclude that some 
      of the inter-individual variability of DOACs can be attributed to alteration of 
      genetic variants of gene loci and drug-drug interactions. Future research should 
      be focused on exploring new genetic variants, their effect, and molecular 
      mechanisms that contribute to alteration of plasma levels of DOACs.

AB  - Patients with atrial fibrillation may require rhythm control therapy in addition 
      to anticoagulation therapy for the prevention of stroke. Since 2012, the European 
      Society of Cardiology and European Heart Rhythm Association guidelines have 
      recommended non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, including rivaroxaban, 
      for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. During the 
      same period, these guidelines have also recommended dronedarone or amiodarone as 
      second-line rhythm control agents in certain patients with atrial fibrillation 
      and no contraindications. Amiodarone and dronedarone both strongly inhibit 
      P-glycoprotein, while dronedarone is a moderate and amiodarone a weak inhibitor 
      of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Based on these data and evidence from 
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling, amiodarone and dronedarone are 
      expected to have similar effects on rivaroxaban exposure resulting from 
      P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 inhibition. However, the rivaroxaban label recommends 
      against the concomitant use of dronedarone, but not amiodarone, citing a lack of 
      evidence on the concomitant use of rivaroxaban and dronedarone as the reason for 
      the different recommendations. In this report, we discuss evidence from clinical 
      studies and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling on the potential for 
      increased rivaroxaban exposure resulting from drug-drug interaction between 
      rivaroxaban and dronedarone or amiodarone. The current evidence supports the same 
      clinical status and concomitant use of either amiodarone or dronedarone with 
      rivaroxaban, which could be considered in future recommendations.

      Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling and Simulation.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is commonly used for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
      for patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. Rivaroxaban is primarily 
      eliminated by hepatic CYP450 metabolism and renal excretion. Rifampin is a 
      commonly used antibiotic for prosthetic joint infections (PJI) and a potent 
      inducer of CYP450 enzymes. Clinical data about drug-drug interactions of 
      rivaroxaban and rifampin are limited. The present study is to describe DDI of 
      rivaroxaban and rifampin in several prosthetic joint infections patients 
      undergoing major orthopedic surgery. We retrospectively identified six patients 
      concomitantly administered with rivaroxaban and rifampin between 2019 and 2020. 
      Plasma samples of these patients with accurate sampling time were chosen from the 
      biobank and plasma levels of rivaroxaban were measured at each time point. A 
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for the rivaroxaban-rifampin 
      interaction was developed to predict the optimal dosing regimen of rivaroxaban in 
      the case of co-medication with rifampin. The model was validated by the observed 
      plasma concentration of rivaroxaban from the above patients. From this model, it 
      could be simulated that when rifampin starts or stops, gradually changing 
      rivaroxaban dose during the first few days would elevate the efficacy and safety 
      of rivaroxaban.

LID - 10.1016/j.hlc.2012.04.002 [doi]
AB  - Non-valvular atrial fibrillation is a major cause of strokes in patients of all 
      ages. Warfarin has been the mainstay anticoagulant for stroke prevention for many 
      years. Warfarin use is limited by frequent monitoring and drug interactions. New 
      oral anticoagulants have been investigated in recent large randomised trials: 
      direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban). These new anticoagulants do not require regular monitoring. Dabigatran 
      and rivaroxaban have been shown to be non-inferior, whilst apixaban has been 
      shown to be superior to warfarin in terms of stroke and systemic embolism. There 
      are practical issues of cost, lack of availability on the Pharmaceutical Benefits 
      Scheme currently, and a lack of reversal agents. These new oral anticoagulants 
      may revolutionise anticoagulation for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation.

TI  - An in vitro study to investigate the interference of enoxaparin on plasma levels

PG  - 309-315
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.12974 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Co-administration of enoxaparin and a direct oral factor Xa 
      inhibitor (xabans: apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) could give rise to the 
      problem of overlapping the anti-Xa activity when measuring direct oral 
      anticoagulant (DOAC) levels. We aimed to evaluate in vitro the degree of the 
      interference of increasing enoxaparin concentrations on xaban plasma levels 
      measured by different chromogenic anti-Xa assays with drug-specific calibrators 
      and controls. METHODS: Seven plasma samples were spiked with apixaban, edoxaban, 
      or rivaroxaban at fixed concentration, and enoxaparin at increasing 
      concentrations (0, 0.125, 0.250, 0.50, 1.0, 1.50, and 2.0 IU/mL). The evaluated 
      chromogenic assays were as follows: Biophen DiXaI and Biophen Heparin LRT (Hyphen 
      BioMed), Berichrom Heparin and Innovance Heparin (Siemens), STA-Liquid Anti-Xa 
      (Stago Diagnostics), Technochrom anti-Xa (Technoclone), and HemosIL Liquid 
      Anti-Xa (Werfen). RESULTS: The presence of enoxaparin caused increased DOAC 
      levels, with over-estimation depending on the anti-Xa assay and on the heparin 
      concentration in the sample. The smallest over-estimation was in the sample with 
      enoxaparin 0.125 IU/mL and the greatest in the sample with enoxaparin 2.0 IU/mL 
      (0%, 3.1%, and 7.4% vs 583.8%, 526.1%, and 415.2% for apixaban, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban, respectively). Biophen DiXaI showed lower interference compared to 
      other methods (maximum over-estimation in the presence of enoxaparin 2.0 IU/mL: 
      56.4% dosing rivaroxaban by Biophen DIXaI vs 583.8% dosing apixaban by Berichrom 
      Heparin). CONCLUSION: The presence of enoxaparin interferes with xabans 
      measurement by chromogenic anti-Xa assays causing falsely elevated DOAC levels, 
      the over-estimation being dependent on the anti-Xa assay and on the heparin 
      concentration in the sample.

TI  - Impact of four direct oral anticoagulants on rotational thromboelastometry 
      (ROTEM).
PG  - 84-93
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.12744 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) is a point of care method 
      used to monitor coagulation during surgery and to guide transfusion strategies in 
      patients presenting with severe bleeding. The aim of our study was to determine 
      the impact of four direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) on 3 commonly used ROTEM 
      tests. METHODS: Whole blood samples from 20 healthy donors were spiked in vitro 
      with apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban or dabigatran at 5 different plasma 
      concentrations (0-1000 ng/mL). EXTEM, INTEM and FIBTEM tests were systematically 
      performed. RESULTS: There was a linear relationship between the increase in 
      clotting time (CT) and plasma DOAC concentrations in both the EXTEM and INTEM 
      tests. We found that the DOAC concentration required to double EXTEM CT was 
      1042 ± 225 ng/mL for apixaban, 134 ± 38 ng/mL for edoxaban, 176 ± 26 ng/mL for 
      rivaroxaban and 284 ± 73 ng/mL for dabigatran. INTEM CT was less sensitive than 
      EXTEM CT whatever the anticoagulant. EXTEM CT was above the normal range for 5 of 
      5 spiked samples when the plasma concentrations were ~1000 ng/mL for apixaban, 
      ~100 ng/mL for edoxaban, ~200 ng/mL for rivaroxaban and ~200 ng/mL for 
      dabigatran. Maximum Clot Firmness in EXTEM, INTEM and FIBTEM tests was not 
      affected whatever the DOAC or its concentration. CONCLUSION: This study found a 
      DOAC dose-dependent increase in ROTEM CTs. ROTEM tests were only poorly impacted 
      by low levels of edoxaban, rivaroxaban or dabigatran. Apixaban had only a low 
      effect even at high concentrations.

TI  - New Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC) and Their Use Today.
LID - 10.3390/dj4010005 [doi]
LID - 5
AB  - The ideal anticoagulant is oral, has a wide therapeutic range, predictable 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, a rapid onset of action, an available 
      antidote, minimal side effects and minimal interactions with other drugs or food. 
      With the development of the novel direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), we now have 
      an alternative to the traditional vitamin K antagonists (VKA) for the prevention 
      and treatment of thrombosis. DOACs have limited monitoring requirements and very 
      predictable pharmacokinetic profiles. They were shown to be non-inferior or 
      superior to VKA in the prophylaxis or treatment of thromboembolic events. 
      Particularly in terms of safety they were associated with less major bleeding, 
      including intracranial bleeding, thus providing a superior benefit for the 
      prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Despite these 
      advantages, there are remaining limitations with DOACs: their dependence on renal 
      and hepatic function for clearance and the lack of an approved reversal agent, 
      whereas such antidotes are successively being made available. DOACs do not need 
      regular monitoring to assess the treatment effect but, on the other hand, they 
      interact with other drugs and interfere with functional coagulation assays. From 
      a practical point of view, the properties of oral administration, simple dosing 
      without monitoring, a short half-life allowing for the possibility of 
      uncomplicated switching or bridging, and proven safety overwhelm the 
      disadvantages, making them an attractive option for short- or long-term 
      anticoagulation.

TI  - Drug-Drug Interactions Leading to Adverse Drug Reactions with Rivaroxaban: A 
      Systematic Review of the Literature and Analysis of VigiBase.
LID - 10.3390/jpm11040250 [doi]
LID - 250
AB  - Rivaroxaban has become an alternative to vitamin K antagonists, which are 
      considered to be at higher risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI) and more 
      difficult to use. However, DDI do occur. We systematically reviewed studies that 
      evaluated them and analysed DDI and subsequent adverse drug reactions (ADR) 
      reported in spontaneous reports and VigiBase. We systematically searched articles 
      that explored DDI with rivaroxaban up to 20 August 2018 via Medline, Embase and 
      Google Scholar. Data from VigiBase came from spontaneous reports recovered up to 
      2 January 2018, where Omega was used to detect signals and identify potential 
      interactions in terms of triplets with two drugs and one ADR. We identified 31 
      studies and 28 case reports. Studies showed significant variation in the 
      pharmacokinetic for rivaroxaban, and an increased risk of haemorrhage or 
      thromboembolic events due to DDI was highlighted in case reports. From VigiBase, 
      a total of 21,261 triplets were analysed and the most reported was 
      rivaroxaban-aspirin-gastrointestinal haemorrhage. In VigiBase, only 34.8% of the 
      DDI reported were described or understood, and most were pharmacodynamic DDI. 
      These data suggest that rivaroxaban should be considered to have significant 
      potential for DDI, especially with CYP3A/P-gp modulators or with drugs that 
      impair haemostasis.

      review of pharmacokinetics, safety, efficacy, quality of life, and cost 
      effectiveness.
PG  - 789-98
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S45644 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) continues to be a leading cause of cerebrovascular 
      morbidity and mortality resulting from cardioembolic stroke. Oral anticoagulation 
      therapy has been shown to decrease the incidence of cardioembolic stroke in 
      patients with AF by more than 50%. Appropriate use of anticoagulation with 
      vitamin K antagonists requires precise adherence and monitoring. A number of 
      factors that potentially induce patients' dissatisfaction reduce quality of 
      patient life. New direct oral anticoagulants, such as the direct factor Xa 
      inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and the thrombin inhibitor 
      dabigatran, were developed to overcome the limitations of the conventional 
      anticoagulant drugs. However, models to optimize the benefit of therapy and to 
      ensure that therapy can be safely continued are missing for the new oral 
      anticoagulants. This review will briefly describe the new oral anticoagulants 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban with focus on their use for 
      prevention of embolic events in AF. Moreover, it will discuss the safety, 
      efficacy, cost data, and benefit for patients' quality of life and adherence.

TI  - Oral anticoagulation with Factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors: Is there an 
      alternative to warfarin?
PG  - 196-203
AB  - Vitamin K antagonists (VKA), such as warfarin, have been the only available oral 
      anticoagulants despite their many limitations. The greatest medical need is to 
      find a replacement for warfarin for long-term therapy, particularly for stroke 
      prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Emerging oral anticoagulants are 
      free from many of warfarin's drawbacks and may offer a convenient alternative. 
      Drugs in advanced development target factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban) or 
      thrombin (dabigatran etexilate). Recently, the RE-LY phase III study found 
      dabigatran etexilate was an effective and convenient alternative to warfarin in 
      stroke prevention for AF patients. Within the next two years, similar studies 
      comparing rivaroxaban and apixaban versus warfarin in AF patients will become 
      available. This paper reviews warfarin's limitations, discusses the 
      pharmacokinetics of emerging anticoagulants in advanced development, and 
      summarizes trials with an emphasis on head-to-head studies comparing novel 
      anticoagulants to warfarin.

AB  - Cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) is the second leading cause of death in cancer 
      patients after tumor progression. The treatment of CAT is challenging because of 
      a high risk of VTE recurrence, a high risk of bleeding, common presence of 
      comorbidities, poly-medication, and potential drug-drug interactions (DDI). Since 
      2018, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) represent a promising therapeutic 
      alternative and have been recently included into the 2019 update of the 
      International Initiative on Thrombosis and Cancer (ITAC-CME) clinical practice 
      guidelines for management of CAT. However, pharmacokinetic studies suggest that 
      concomitant treatment with P-gp or CYP3A4 inhibitors will result in an increased 
      exposure to rivaroxaban and apixaban, but the clinical relevance of these studies 
      is unknown. In addition, there is an important inter-individual variability in 
      drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination, even more in cancer 
      patients. Overall, the risk of pharmacokinetic DDI should be estimated based on 
      several individual (patient age, renal and liver function, number of 
      comedications) and diseases-related factors, including inflammation, sarcopenia, 
      and low body weight. In this context, DDI with clinical implications could be 
      expected with anti-neoplastic agents or supportive care treatments, especially 
      with drugs known to be moderate or strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp. 
      Consequently, in the presence of potential DDIs through CYP3A4, and/or P-gp, 
      LMWHs remain the first-line anticoagulant of choice for the long-term treatment 
      of CAT. Multidisciplinary consultation meetings and therapeutic patient education 
      should be emphasized in the complex management of CAT.

AB  - The introduction of novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) have long been expected 
      drugs and they quickly became used widespread as their clinical effectiveness was 
      as good as, or even better than the previously used only oral anticoagulant drug, 
      the coumarins. Thus, the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the activated 
      factor X inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) have become the part of 
      daily therapeutic practice. Their permeation was facilitated by the guideline 
      which suggested that no laboratory monitoring was required during NOAC treatment 
      and this was very convenient for both patients and doctors. The clinical 
      experience obtained in the past years, however have proved that the 'one size 
      fits all' view is oversimplified and there are numerous situations when the 
      determination NOAC levels is unavoidable or highly recommended. This review 
      discusses the laboratory aspects of NOAC treatment, primarily summarizing their 
      effect on the screening tests and special assays of hemostasis and we also 
      describe the correct methods to determine their plasma concentrations. Orv Hetil.

AB  - Warfarin, heparin and their derivatives have been the traditional anticoagulants 
      used for prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism. While the modern 
      clinician is familiar with the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these agents, 
      their adverse effects have provided the impetus for the development of newer 
      anticoagulants with improved safety, ease of administration, more predictable 
      pharmacodynamics and comparable efficacy. Research into haemostasis and the 
      coagulation cascade has made the development of these newer anticoagulants 
      possible. These drugs include the factor Xa inhibitors and IIa (thrombin) 
      inhibitors. Direct and indirect factor Xa inhibitors are being developed with a 
      relative rapid onset of action and stable pharmacokinetic profiles negating the 
      need for close monitoring; this potentially makes them a more attractive option 
      than heparin or warfarin. Examples of direct factor Xa inhibitors include 
      apixaban, rivaroxaban, otamixaban, betrixaban and edoxaban. Examples of indirect 
      factor Xa inhibitors include fondaparinux, idraparinux and idrabiotaparinux. 
      Direct thrombin inhibitors (factor IIa inhibitors) were developed with the 
      limitations of standard heparin and warfarin in mind. Examples include 
      recombinant hirudin (lepirudin), bivalirudin, ximelagatran, argatroban, and 
      dabigatran etexilate. This review will discuss emerging novel anticoagulants and 
      their use for the prophylaxis and management of venous thromboembolism, for 
      stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and for coronary artery 
      disease.

AB  - Introduction: We update the knowledge, since the last review in 2017, about 
      drug-drug interactions (DDI) of non-vitamin-K-antagonist oral anticoagulants 
      (NOAC) in patients ≥75 years.Areas covered: The literature was searched for: 
      'dabigatran,' 'rivaroxaban,' 'edoxaban,' or 'apixaban' and drugs, affecting 
      platelet function, CYP3A4-, CYP2C9-, or P-Gp-activity. Pharmacodynamic DDI of 
      NOAC with drugs affecting platelet function like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs and antiplatelet agents occur most frequently. Pharmacokinetic DDI with 
      NOAC were found for 37 of 117 drugs. Reports about DDI with NOAC were found for 
      51% of P-gp-affecting, 38% for CYP2C9-affecting and 27% for CYP3A4-affecting 
      drugs. Reports about DDI of cardiovascular drugs with NOAC were the most 
      prevalent, followed by anti-infective and nervous system drugs. NOAC plasma 
      levels were measured in retrospective and cohort studies and were associated with 
      concomitant medication. Reports about DDI of NOAC were found in 71 patients 
      ≥75 years.Expert opinion: The knowledge about DDI of NOAC in elderly patients is 
      very limited. Studies should be carried out to investigate the role of drugs 
      potentially interacting with NOAC, which until now have not been investigated. 
      When studying DDI of NOAC, care should be taken to include elderly patients with 
      impaired renal function and patients on polymedication.

PG  - 490-501
LID - 10.1055/s-0039-1692703 [doi]
AB  - Anticoagulant drugs comprise a specific subcategory of antithrombotic agents that 
      act to inhibit blood coagulation at various stages, reducing clot development and 
      ultimately lowering the risk of developing new-onset or recurrent thrombosis. 
      Although the long history of anticoagulant drugs has been characteristically 
      shaped by coumarin and heparin derivatives, a new generation of direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs), which specifically inhibit thrombin or activated factor 
      X, combine many advantages of their progenitor drugs, and hence are prepotently 
      revolutionizing the landscape of antithrombotic therapy. Several drugs (apixaban 
      [BMS-562247], dabigatran [BIBR953], edoxaban [DU-1766], rivaroxaban [BAY 
      59-7939]) have already received widespread approval by national or supranational 
      medicinal agencies. This narrative article provides a state-of-the-art for these 
      and for several other DOACs at different stages of clinical evaluation 
      (betrixaban, darexaban, eribaxaban, letaxaban, nokxaban), and certain others 
      whose development has been discontinued (AZD-0837, fidexaban, LY517717, 
      odiparcil, otamixaban, TTP889, and ximelagatran). What clearly emerges from our 
      analysis is that DOACs sharing very similar mechanisms of action are still 
      characterized by different efficacy and safety profiles. This not only depends on 
      biochemical, biological, and pharmacokinetic characteristics, but also on lack of 
      standardization between different clinical trials in terms of targeted disease, 
      patient recruitment, sample size, duration and endpoints, as well as lack of 
      harmonization around procedures used for drug licensing. These factors contribute 
      to challenging the minds of physicians, who may find difficulty navigating their 
      way through multiple indications, different pharmacological profiles, various 
      side effects, and specific drug-to-drug interactions. Such considerations also 
      burden laboratory professionals, who may face organizational and economic 
      challenges in developing and/or implementing multiple assays to assess the 
      pharmacodynamics (effect on coagulation) or pharmacokinetics (drug levels) of 
      DOACs.

TI  - Postoperative Bleeding After Administration of a Single Dose of Rivaroxaban to a 
      Patient Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy.
PG  - 11
LID - 11
AB  - A 62-year-old man was admitted to hospital for elective revision of a left total 
      hip arthroplasty. His history was significant for human immunodeficiency virus 
      (HIV) infection for which he was taking the following antiretroviral agents 
      (ARVs): etravirine, ritonavir, darunavir, raltegravir and 
      tenofovir/emtricitabine. Rivaroxaban 10 mg daily was commenced on the second 
      postoperative day for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. Approximately 
      24 h later, the patient developed hypotension and anaemia, accompanied by thigh 
      swelling due to bleeding at the surgical site. Fluid resuscitation was commenced 
      with red cell transfusion. The prothrombin time (PT) was prolonged at 24.3 
      (10.6-15.3) s, and a rivaroxaban level taken 24 h after administration was 
      75 ng/mL. Rivaroxaban was ceased, the PT normalised within 24 h of stopping the 
      drug, and the patient made an uneventful recovery. None of the other 
      coadministered drugs are known to interact with rivaroxaban, or are likely to, 
      based on their metabolic pathways. Rivaroxaban, a substrate for cytochrome P450 
      (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is contraindicated in patients concomitantly 
      treated with strong inhibitors of both these systems, e.g. protease inhibitors 
      (PIs) such as ritonavir (based on in vitro data and a pharmacokinetic study in 
      healthy volunteers). No published data are available on the PI darunavir, a 
      moderate inhibitor; however, concomitant use with rivaroxaban should also be 
      avoided. A prolonged PT and a rivaroxaban trough level greater than eight times 
      that predicted from pharmacokinetic modelling suggests that bleeding was due to 
      increased exposure to rivaroxaban, probably due to an interaction with ritonavir 
      and darunavir. This is supported by a Drug Interaction Probability Scale (DIPS) 
      score of 8. An interaction between a single dose of rivaroxaban and ARVs may be 
      clinically significant; therefore, the patient's medication history should be 
      extensively evaluated to identify any potential interactions.

AB  - New, target specific, oral anticoagulants have been shown to be safe and 
      effective in prevention and treatment of thromboembolism without laboratory 
      monitoring. However, clinical use of the drugs dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and 
      apixaban requires laboratory measurement of their anticoagulant effect in 
      specific clinical situations. This paper reviews the data available on use of 
      screening and specialized testing to measure the anticoagulant effect and drug 
      levels in patients prescribed these medications. Their effect on other 
      coagulation assays is also reviewed.

TI  - Effect of Danhong injection on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      rivaroxaban in rats.
LID - 10.1007/s00210-024-03453-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Rivaroxaban is often used in combination with DHI to 
      treat thromboembolic disease. Whether the combination causing HDIs is still 
      unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects of DHI on 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in rats and effects on 
      CYP3A2. METHODS: Plasma concentration of rivaroxaban with or without DHI was 
      determined by HPLC. Pharmacokinetics parameters were calculated. Effect of DHI on 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban was investigated by APTT, PT, TT, FIB, INR, 
      length of tail thrombosis, vWF, t-PA, PAI-1, IL-1β, TNF-α and histopathological 
      sections. Effect of DHI on CYP3A2 in rats was investigated by probe drug method. 
      RESULTS: C(max) and AUC of rivaroxaban increased significantly in combination 
      group (P < 0.05). APTT, PT, INR and TT increased (P < 0.05), length of tail 
      thrombosis, FIB, vWF, PAI-1, IL-1β and TNF-α of combination group decreased 
      significantly (P < 0.05) compared with rivaroxaban or DHI alone. Histopathologic 
      section of tail thrombus had significant improvement. C(max) and AUC of dapsone 
      increased (P < 0.05) in DHI group. CONCLUSION: In summary, DHI is an inhibitor of 
      CYP3A2 and could significantly affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic of 
      rivaroxaban, enhance anticoagulant and antithrombotic efficacy in rats. However, 
      the combination of rivaroxaban and DHI might lead to potential HDIs. The dosage 
      of rivaroxaban should be adjusted in clinical.

LID - 10.1111/ijlh.13729 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rapid results are needed when plasma concentrations of direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) are required in acute clinical settings. We evaluated the 
      impact of centrifugation time and pneumatic tube transport on DOAC plasma 
      concentrations with the overall aim of reducing turnaround time. METHODS: Blood 
      samples were spiked with rivaroxaban, apixaban or dabigatran in a low and a high 
      concentration prior to centrifugation for 25 minutes (3163 g) or 5 minutes 
      (3000 g) (n = 20 for each DOAC). Both samples spiked with DOACs (n = 20 for each 
      DOAC) and patient samples (n = 25 in total) were transported manually or by 
      pneumatic tube system samples. RESULTS: For samples spiked with DOAC, 
      statistically significant differences in DOAC plasma concentrations were found 
      between centrifugation times for rivaroxaban in low (P < .05) and high (P < .05) 
      concentrations. Relative bias was below 9% for all DOACs. Statistically 
      significant differences were found between modes of transportation for 
      rivaroxaban (P < .01) and dabigatran (P < .01) in high concentrations. Relative 
      bias was 4%-23% for all DOACs. For patient samples, no statistically significant 
      differences were found between modes of transportation, and relative bias was 
      below 12% for all DOACs. CONCLUSION: Minor, clinically insignificant, differences 
      regarding centrifugation times were found in DOAC plasma concentrations. 
      Importantly, no significant differences were found according to transportation 
      modes for samples collected from patients. Although statistically significant 
      differences were found depending on mode of transportation of spiked samples, 
      relative bias was clinically acceptable. Thus, reduced centrifugation time and 
      pneumatic tube transport should be considered to reduce turnaround time for rapid 
      measurement of DOAC plasma concentrations.

AB  - Anticoagulants have been used in clinical practice for more than 50 years. Their 
      indications expand, as more people are diagnosed each year with atrial 
      fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Vitamin K antagonists have been the most 
      popular choice due to their effectiveness and their ability to reverse bleeding 
      using a known antidote; oral and intravenous vitamin K have long been known to 
      reverse the effects of warfarin. With new classes of anticoagulants making their 
      way onto the market, such as factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban) and 
      direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran), the need for new reversal agents is 
      paramount. Patients tend to be more receptive to these medications because they 
      do not require routine blood monitoring, can be used at fixed doses, and do not 
      have major drug or food interactions. Antidotes for these medications have shown 
      promise in animal models and are currently in clinical trials.

TI  - Laboratory measurement of the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants: 
      selecting the optimal assay based on drug, assay availability, and clinical 
      indication.
PG  - 241-7
LID - 10.1007/s11239-015-1282-7 [doi]
AB  - Although the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) do not require 
      routine monitoring, there are special circumstances in which laboratory 
      measurement may be warranted. The objectives of this review are to summarize 
      evidence on the influence of the NOACs on coagulation tests and provide practical 
      guidance to clinicians on measurement and interpretation of coagulation assays in 
      NOAC-treated patients. Selection of an appropriate assay for NOAC measurement 
      depends on the drug, clinical objective, and assay availability. Separate 
      suggestions for assay selection are provided depending on whether specialized 
      assays are available or whether choice is limited to conventional coagulation 
      assays such as the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin 
      time (APTT). The dilute thrombin time (TT) and ecarin-based assays are able to 
      quantify dabigatran across a broad range of concentrations, but are not widely 
      available. A normal TT excludes clinically relevant levels. A normal APTT 
      probably excludes excess levels of dabigatran, but does not rule out typical 
      on-therapy drug concentrations. The PT is insufficiently sensitive to dabigatran 
      to be useful in most situations. Factor Xa inhibitors may be quantified with an 
      anti-Xa assay calibrated with drug-specific standards. A normal PT probably 
      excludes excess levels of rivaroxaban and edoxaban, but not typical on-therapy 
      levels of these agents. The PT is less sensitive to apixaban. Depending on the 
      sensitivity of the thromboplastin reagent, a normal PT may not exclude excess 
      levels of apixaban. The APTT has inadequate sensitivity to factor Xa inhibitors 
      and is not recommended for their measurement.

TI  - [Has the era of warfarin terminated?].
PG  - 16-20
AB  - Warfarin has for a long time been considered the "gold standard" of oral 
      anticoagulant therapy. Positive effects of this agent are unambiguously supported 
      by accumulated evidence-based data convincingly confirming a decrease in the risk 
      for thrombolytic complications in patients with many diseases of the 
      cardiovascular system: atrial fibrillation, thrombosis of deep veins of 
      extremities, pulmonary artery thromboembolism. However, warfarin has a series of 
      disadvantages complicating its practical application: the necessity of individual 
      adjustment of the dose to maintain the International Normalized Ratio (INR) 
      within the limits of the target values, clinically significant interactions with 
      other drugs and foodstuffs. In this connection, the advent of new oral 
      anticoagulants such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban is associated with 
      great hopes concerning increased efficiency and safety of anticoagulant therapy. 
      However, while the results of large-scale clinical trials are promising, the data 
      on using these agents in real clinical practice suggest that prescription and 
      administration of new oral anticoagulants should be approached with great 
      caution, thoroughly weighing potential risks and benefits. Therefore, switching 
      over the patients with the already adjusted dosage of warfarin and stable values 
      of the INR to new drugs seems hardly advisable.

PG  - 460-464
LID - 10.1111/bjh.16179 [doi]
AB  - There is limited information regarding the performance of tests for direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs). To generate more knowledge, the accuracy of DOAC tests 
      were evaluated using external quality assessment data from multiple years. This 
      data demonstrated a good correlation for the tests with a small overall 
      interlaboratory variability (10% for dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban and 12% 
      for edoxaban). The greatest differences between the various reagents were 
      observed for rivaroxaban, especially for concentrations below 100 ng/ml. In 
      conclusion, the results show overall reliable DOAC levels with some differences 
      between reagent groups. Important finding: clinical decision criteria could be 
      affected by the choice of reagent.

TI  - Pharmacological properties of betrixaban.
PG  - E12-E15
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/suy016 [doi]
AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in acute medically ill patients is a leading cause 
      of in-hospital morbidity and mortality. A majority of these VTE events occur 
      post-discharge, and patients remain at increased VTE risk for up to 3 months 
      post-discharge. Recent clinical trials of extended-duration thromboprophylaxis 
      with enoxaparin, rivaroxaban, and apixaban in acute medically ill patients did 
      not demonstrate a net clinical benefit compared with in-hospital 
      thromboprophylaxis, and were shown to be associated with higher risks of major 
      bleeding. Betrixaban is a new direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) with a different 
      pharmacokinetic profile than other DOACs. Betrixaban has the longest half-life 
      among the DOAC class, with a terminal half-life of 35-45 h and an effective 
      half-life of 19-27 h. Betrixaban has a low peak-to-trough ratio compared with 
      other anticoagulants and a predictable duration of drug exposure, leading to 
      overall consistent anticoagulant effect over 24 h. Betrixaban is mainly cleared 
      via the hepatobiliary system and therefore not contraindicated in patients with 
      severe renal insufficiency. Betrixaban was recently approved for the indication 
      of extended thromboprophylaxis in the United States based on the APEX trial of 
      betrixaban 80 mg once daily for 35-42 days compared with low molecular weight 
      heparin enoxaparin for 10 ± 4 days in hospitalized acute medically ill patients. 
      This study demonstrated that extended-duration betrixaban reduced VTE compared 
      with standard-duration enoxaparin in acute medically ill patients, without 
      increased risk of major bleeding. This patient population at risk of VTE may 
      benefit from extended prophylaxis, ensuring continuum of care from in-hospital to 
      post-discharge.

TI  - Interactions of sugammadex with various anticoagulants .
PG  - 395-403
LID - 10.5414/CP203733 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate in vitro the effect of sugammadex on activated partial 
      thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) prolongations with various 
      anticoagulants as well as the neutralizing effect of rocuronium and vecuronium on 
      sugammadex effects on APTT and PT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated in 
      vitro the effect of sugammadex on APTT and/or PT in plasma of patients on a 
      vitamin K antagonist and with elevated international normalized ratios (INRs), in 
      plasma of healthy subjects spiked with either a low or high concentration of 
      enoxaparin, fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran, and in perioperatively 
      collected patient plasma. In addition, we explored whether the effects of 
      sugammadex persisted in the presence of rocuronium or vecuronium, or whether they 
      were counteracted by these compounds. RESULTS: Sugammadex 
      concentration-dependently increased APTT and PT(INR) in all anticoagulant 
      conditions, mainly in a proportional manner, with no differences between 
      perioperatively collected patient and control plasma. Rocuronium and vecuronium 
      both neutralized the effects of sugammadex on APTT and PT. CONCLUSION: Sugammadex 
      has a transient effect on coagulation and is unlikely to increase bleeding risk, 
      this possibility cannot be excluded for scenarios not clinically studied.

TI  - Study of binding interaction of rivaroxaban with bovine serum albumin using

PG  - 134
LID - 10.1186/s13065-017-0366-1 [doi]
LID - 134
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban is a direct inhibitor of coagulation factor Xa and is 
      used for venous thromboembolic disorders. The rivaroxaban interaction with BSA 
      was studied to understand its PK and PD (pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetics) 
      properties. Multi-spectroscopic studies were used to study the interaction which 
      included UV spectrophotometric, spectrofluorometric and three dimensional 
      spectrofluorometric studies. Further elucidation of data was done by molecular 
      simulation studies to evaluate the interaction behavior between BSA and 
      rivaroxaban. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban quenched the basic fluorescence of BSA molecule 
      by the process of static quenching since rivaroxaban and BSA form a complex that 
      results in shift of the absorption spectra of BSA molecule. A decline in the 
      values of binding constants was detected with the increase of temperatures 
      (298-308 K) and the binding constants were in range from 1.32 × 10(5) to 
      4.3 × 10(3) L mol(-1) indicating the instability of the BSA and rivaroxaban 
      complex at higher temperatures. The data of number of binding sites showed 
      uniformity. The site marker experiments indicated site I (sub-domain IIA) as the 
      principal site for rivaroxaban binding. The thermodynamic study experiments were 
      carried at the temperatures of 298/303/308 K. The ∆G(0), ∆H(0) and ∆S(0) at these 
      temperatures ranged between - 24.67 and - 21.27 kJ mol(-1) and the values for 
      ∆H(0) and ∆S(0) were found to be - 126 kJ mol(-1) and ∆S - 340 J mol(-1) K(-1) 
      The negative value of ∆G(0) indicating spontaneous binding between the two 
      molecules. The negative values in ∆H(0) and ∆S(0) indicated van der Waals 
      interaction and hydrogen bonding were involved during the interaction between 
      rivaroxaban and BSA. CONCLUSIONS: The results of molecular docking were 
      consistent with the results obtained from spectroscopic studies in establishing 
      the principal binding site and type of bonds between rivaroxaban and BSA.

AB  - The present drug-drug interaction study investigates whether single or repeated 
      doses of 240 mg Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761(®) alter the pharmacokinetics or 
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in healthy subjects. This was a single-centre, 
      two-period, fixed-sequence trial. In Period 1, rivaroxaban was taken alone. In 
      Period 2, rivaroxaban was given on the first and last of 8 days of EGb 761(®) 
      treatment. Plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban and anti-Factor Xa activity were 
      determined until 48 h after each rivaroxaban intake. The data of forty-one 
      healthy subjects (25 males, 16 females) aged 21-70 years were evaluable. 
      Geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) for rivaroxaban administered 
      concomitantly with a single or multiple doses of EGb 761(®) vs. rivaroxaban 
      administered alone were 97.97 (91.78, 104.58) and 96.78 (90.67, 103.31) for 
      maximum concentration (C(max)), 98.55 (94.43, 102.84) and 97.82 (93.73, 102.08) 
      for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-∞)) of rivaroxaban in plasma 
      (primary endpoints), 98.19 (92.00, 104.80) and 99.78 (93.43, 106.55) for maximum 
      effect (E(max)), 99.46 (93.63, 105.66) and 99.12 (93.25, 105.35) for area under 
      the effect curve (AUEC(0-48)). All 90% confidence intervals were within the 
      prespecified range of 80%-125%. Neither adverse events related to haemorrhages 
      nor clinically significant findings in haematology or coagulation parameters were 
      observed. The treatments were safe and well-tolerated. Single and repeated doses 
      of EGb 761® neither affect plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban nor anti-Factor 
      Xa activity in healthy subjects.

TI  - A year in review: new drugs for older adults in 2011.
PG  - 258-63
LID - 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2012.05.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: New drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may 
      offer tremendous clinical advances by providing health care providers with new 
      treatment strategies. However, additional care must be taken for safe and 
      effective use of these new agents by older adults. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was 
      to identify FDA-approved medications in 2011 most likely to be prescribed to 
      older adults, and to describe medication characteristics that may require special 
      attention in this population. METHODS: The FDA Web site was reviewed for new drug 
      approvals from January through December 2011. Approved labeling for each drug was 
      obtained from the manufacturer's Web site and PubMed was searched for primary 
      literature published between 1967 and 2012. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban, an oral factor 
      Xa inhibitor, is approved for once-daily use in treatment of nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis after replacement of a hip or 
      knee. Drug interactions and renal function must be considered when prescribing 
      this drug to older adults. Fidaxomicin is an oral anti-infective approved for the 
      treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. It has minimal oral 
      absorption or side effects, no relevant drug interactions, but a very high cost. 
      It is a treatment option after failure of oral metronidazole and oral vancomycin. 
      Roflumilast is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 and is approved to 
      reduce the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations in 
      patients with severe COPD and a history of exacerbations. It is recommended as a 
      second or alternative choice combined with a long-acting bronchodilator in 
      patients at high risk for hospitalization. Indacaterol is an inhaled long-acting 
      β-agonist approved for COPD maintenance. It is administered once daily, which may 
      improve adherence in older adults compared with currently available twice-daily 
      agents. CONCLUSIONS: Four new drugs approved in 2011 applicable to the geriatric 
      population are presented. Clinicians must consider the available evidence, cost, 
      drug-drug interactions, renal function, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
      differences, and patient preferences when considering prescribing these agents to 
      older adults.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use has significantly increased because major 
      medical organizations endorse their role for conditions in which anticoagulation 
      is indicated. Owing to important pharmacokinetic properties, the use of apixaban 
      and rivaroxaban requires careful consideration in at-risk populations such as 
      those with kidney disease. Both apixaban and rivaroxaban undergo some degree of 
      renal elimination, and thus total drug exposure is increased in patients with 
      renal insufficiency and/or those undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT). The 
      available clinical trial and real-world data in this population suggests that 
      apixaban is likely at least comparably effective as warfarin at preventing 
      thromboembolic events and is likely safer when evaluating bleeding risk. 
      Rivaroxaban data is more limited, and the reported results are more discordant. 
      Both apixaban and rivaroxaban have been used successfully in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing kidney transplant listing as well as in 
      the posttransplant setting. Prospective clinical trials evaluating the safety and 
      efficacy of apixaban and rivaroxaban in various conditions where anticoagulation 
      is indicated should include patients with ESRD and kidney transplant recipients 
      to help further define the role that these important novel agents should play in 
      these complex patient populations.

TI  - Eight pharmacokinetic genetic variants are not associated with the risk of 
      bleeding from direct oral anticoagulants in non-valvular atrial fibrillation 
      patients.

LID - 1007113
AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the leading cause of ischemic stroke and 
      treatment has focused on reducing this risk through anticoagulation. Direct Oral 
      Anticoagulants (DOACs) are the first-line guideline-recommended therapy since 
      they are as effective and overall safer than warfarin in preventing AF-related 
      stroke. Although patients bleed less from DOACs compared to warfarin, bleeding 
      remains the primary safety concern with this therapy. Hypothesis: Genetic 
      variants known to modify the function of metabolic enzymes or transporters 
      involved in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of DOACs could increase the risk of 
      bleeding. Aim: To assess the association of eight, functional PK-related single 
      nucleotide variants (SNVs) in five genes (ABCB1, ABCG2, CYP2J2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5) 
      with the risk of bleeding from DOACs in non-valvular AF patients. Methods: A 
      retrospective cohort study was carried out with 2,364 self-identified white 
      non-valvular AF patients treated with either rivaroxaban or apixaban. Genotyping 
      was performed with Illumina Infinium CoreExome v12.1 bead arrays by the Michigan 
      Genomics Initiative biobank. The primary endpoint was a composite of major and 
      clinically relevant non-major bleeding. Cox proportional hazards regression with 
      time-varying analysis assessed the association of the eight PK-related SNVs with 
      the risk of bleeding from DOACs in unadjusted and covariate-adjusted models. The 
      pre-specified primary analysis was the covariate-adjusted, additive genetic 
      models. Six tests were performed in the primary analysis as three SNVs are in the 
      same haplotype, and thus p-values below the Bonferroni-corrected level of 8.33e-3 
      were considered statistically significant. Results: In the primary analysis, none 
      of the SNVs met the Bonferroni-corrected level of statistical significance (all p 
      > 0.1). In exploratory analyses with other genetic models, the ABCB1 (rs4148732) 
      GG genotype tended to be associated with the risk of bleeding from rivaroxaban 
      [HR: 1.391 (95%CI: 1.019-1.900); p = 0.038] but not from apixaban (p = 0.487). 
      Conclusion: Eight functional PK-related genetic variants were not significantly 
      associated with bleeding from either rivaroxaban or apixaban in more than 2,000 
      AF self-identified white outpatients.

      anticoagulants.

LID - 10.1186/1477-9560-12-8 [doi]
AB  - Over the past several years a new era for patients requiring anticoagulation has 
      arrived. The approval of new target specific oral anticoagulants offers 
      practitioners several advantages over traditionally used vitamin K antagonist 
      agents including predictable pharmacokinetics, rapid onset of action, comparable 
      efficacy and safety, all without the need for routine monitoring. Despite these 
      benefits, hemorrhagic complicates are inevitable with any anticoagulation 
      treatment. One of the major disadvantages of the new oral anticoagulants is lack 
      of specific antidotes or reversal agents for patients with serious bleeding or 
      need for urgent surgery. As use of the new target specific oral anticoagulants 
      continues to increase, practitioners will need to understand both the 
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties of the agents, as well as, the 
      available literature with use of non-specific therapies to reverse 
      anticoagulation. Four factor prothrombin complex concentrates have been available 
      for several years in Europe, and recently became available in the United States 
      with approval of Kcentra. These products have shown efficacy in reversing 
      anticoagulation from vitamin K antagonists, however their usefulness with the new 
      target specific oral anticoagulants is poorly understood. This article will 
      review the properties of dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban, as well as the 
      limited literature available on the effectiveness of prothrombin complex 
      concentrates in reversal of their anticoagulant effects. Additional studies are 
      needed to more accurately define the role of prothrombin complex concentrates in 
      patients with life threatening bleeding or who require emergent surgery, as 
      current data is both limited and conflicting.

AB  - Oral anticoagulation therapy is transforming with the advent of the target 
      specific oral anticoagulants, particularly, the direct thrombin inhibitors and 
      factor Xa inhibitors. These agents have demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety 
      and offer several potential advantages over current standard of care therapy, 
      warfarin. Nevertheless, the pharmacology between the newly approved oral 
      anticoagulants differs and must be considered for appropriate management and 
      patient selection. The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of dabigatran 
      etexilate, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban are discussed in detail, which may 
      translate into considerable clinical implications.

      evidence.

LID - 10.2217/fca-2019-0038 [doi]
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants are associated with lower rates of bleeding than 
      vitamin K antagonists, but life-threatening bleeding still occurs. Andexanet alfa 
      is a catalytically inactive recombinant modified human factor Xa molecule that 
      reverses the anticoagulant effect of direct and indirect acting factor Xa 
      inhibitors. In the ANNEXA-4 study, treatment with andexanet was associated with a 
      92% reduction in median anti-Xa activity levels and excellent or good hemostasis 
      in 82% of patients presenting with serious bleeding while receiving apixaban or 
      rivaroxaban. In this review, we discuss the burden of bleeding in anticoagulated 
      patients and the need for reversal agents, review the mechanism of action of 
      andexanet and critically evaluate the evidence for its efficacy and safety.

TI  - Rivaroxaban as an oral anticoagulant for stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation.
PG  - 197-205
LID - 10.2147/TCRM.S30159 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the developed 
      world and is associated with a fivefold increase in the risk of stroke, 
      accounting for up to 15% of strokes in the general population. The European 
      Society of Cardiology now recommends direct oral anticoagulants, such as 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran, in preference to vitamin K antagonist 
      therapy for the prevention of stroke in patients with A F. This review focuses on 
      the direct Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban, summarizing the properties that make 
      rivaroxaban appropriate for anticoagulant therapy in this indication (including 
      its predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and once-daily dosing 
      regimen) and describing data from the Phase III ROCKET AF trial, which showed 
      once-daily rivaroxaban to be noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke 
      in patients with nonvalvular AF. In this trial, similar rates of major and 
      nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding were observed; however, when compared with 
      warfarin, rivaroxaban was associated with clinically significant reductions in 
      intracranial and fatal bleeding. On the basis of these results, rivaroxaban was 
      approved in both the United States and the European Union for the prevention of 
      stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. Subanalyses of 
      ROCKET AF data showed rivaroxaban to have consistent efficacy and safety across a 
      wide range of patients, and studies to confirm these results in real-world 
      settings are underway. This review also describes practical considerations for 
      treatment with rivaroxaban in clinical practice (including dose reductions in 
      specific high-risk patients, eg, those with renal impairment), recommendations 
      for the transition from vitamin K antagonists to rivaroxaban, the management of 
      bleeding events, and the measurement of rivaroxaban exposure.

TI  - Proactive monitoring of drug-drug interactions between direct oral anticoagulants 
      and small-molecule inhibitors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 481-490
LID - 10.1038/s41416-024-02744-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) have revolutionised the treatment of 
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, SMI-induced drug-drug interactions 
      (DDIs) with frequently co-administered direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), 
      increase thromboembolic and bleeding risks. This study investigated and 
      proactively managed the consequences of DOAC-SMI DDIs. METHODS: This prospective, 
      observational study enrolled patients with NSCLC concomitantly using a DOAC and 
      SMI. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with DOAC plasma trough 
      (C(trough)) and peak (C(peak)) concentrations outside expected ranges. Secondary 
      outcomes included DOAC treatment modifications, incidence of bleeding and 
      thromboembolic events and feasibility evaluation of pharmacokinetically guided 
      DOAC dosing. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were analysed. Thirty-nine percent 
      (13/33) had DOAC C(trough) and/or C(peak) were outside the expected ranges in 39% 
      (13/33). In 71% (5/7) of patients with DOAC concentrations quantified before and 
      during concurrent SMI use, DOAC C(trough) and/or C(peak) increased or decreased 
      >50% upon SMI initiation. In all patients in whom treatment modifications were 
      deemed necessary, DOAC concentrations were adjusted to within the expected 
      ranges. CONCLUSION: Proactive monitoring showed that a substantial proportion of 
      patients had DOAC concentrations outside the expected ranges. DOAC concentrations 
      were successfully normalised after treatment modifications. These results 
      highlight the importance of proactive monitoring of DOAC-SMI DDIs to improve 
      treatment in patients with NSCLC.

TI  - On Absorption Modeling and Food Effect Prediction of Rivaroxaban, a BCS II Drug 
      Orally Administered as an Immediate-Release Tablet.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13020283 [doi]
LID - 283
AB  - The present work evaluates the food effect on the absorption of rivaroxaban 
      (Riva), a BCS II drug, from the orally administered commercial immediate-release 
      tablet (Xarelto IR) using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and 
      conventional in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) models. The bioavailability of 
      Riva upon oral administration of Xarelto IR tablet is reported to exhibit a 
      positive food effect. The PBPK model for Riva was developed and verified using 
      the previously reported in vivo data for oral solution (5 and 10 mg) and Xarelto 
      IR tablet (5 and 10 mg dose strength). Once the PBPK model was established, the 
      in vivo performance of the tablet formulation with the higher dose strength 
      (Xarelto IR tablet 20 mg in fasted and fed state) was predicted using the 
      experimentally obtained data of in vitro permeability, biorelevant solubility and 
      in vitro dynamic dissolution data using United States Pharmacopeia (USP) IV 
      flow-through cell apparatus. In addition, the mathematical IVIVC model was 
      developed using the in vitro dissolution and in vivo profile of 20 mg strength 
      Xarelto IR tablet in fasted condition. Using the developed IVIVC model, the 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the Xarelto IR tablet in fed condition was 
      predicted and compared with the PK parameters obtained via the PBPK model. A 
      virtual in vivo PK study was designed using a single-dose, 3-treatment cross-over 
      trial in 50 subjects to predict the PK profile of the Xarelto® IR tablet in the 
      fed state. Overall, the results obtained from the IVIVC model were found to be 
      comparable with those from the PBPK model. The outcome from both models pointed 
      to the positive food effect on the in vivo profile of the Riva. The developed 
      models thus can be effectively extended to establish bioequivalence for the 
      marketed and novel complex formulations of Riva such as amorphous solid 
      dispersions.

TI  - Rivaroxaban for Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in Patients with Nephrotic Syndrome: 
      A Single-Arm, Prospective Study.
PG  - 346-358
LID - 10.1159/000540107 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thromboembolism is a recognized complication of nephrotic syndrome 
      (NS). Evidence supporting the use of rivaroxaban to prevent NS-related thrombosis 
      is limited and controversial. This study aimed to explore the impact of NS on 
      rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and to collect observational data on the efficacy 
      and safety of rivaroxaban as primary thromboprophylaxis in patients with NS. 
      METHODS: This prospective study analyzed 141 patients with NS who received 
      rivaroxaban (10 mg/day) for thromboprophylaxis. High-performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure the trough and peak 
      plasma concentrations (C(trough) and C(max)) of rivaroxaban. The influence of 
      clinical and genetic factors on these concentrations was examined using 
      multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: The median C(max) and C(trough) were 
      68.5 ng/mL (interquartile range [IQR], 31.7-105.5 ng/mL) and 4.4 ng/mL (IQR, 
      1.2-11.9 ng/mL), respectively. The incidence of thromboembolic events (TEs) was 
      12.8%, while that of bleeding events was 14.2%, although all were classified as 
      minor. Albumin level was the most significant factor affecting C(max) (ρ = 0.55; 
      p < 0.001) and was also significantly associated with TEs (0.81; 0.71-0.91 per 
      1.0 g/dL increase; p = 0.001) and bleeding risks (1.11; 1.03-1.19 per 1.0 g/dL 
      increase; p = 0.008). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene 
      significantly influenced C(trough) but were not associated with clinical 
      outcomes. CONCLUSION: Hypoalbuminemia significantly affects the pharmacokinetics 
      of rivaroxaban in NS patients. A dose-adjustment strategy based on rivaroxaban 
      concentrations, accounting for variable albumin levels, may improve the safety 
      and efficacy of thromboprophylaxis in this population.

AB  - Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients receiving non-vitamin-K antagonist oral 
      anticoagulants (NOAC) are commonly excluded from thrombolytic therapy, as 
      interpretation of coagulation tests remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the 
      applicability of a novel institutional protocol for thrombolysis based on current 
      expert recommendations and NOAC specific coagulation assessment. We included 
      hospitalized AIS patients receiving NOAC for at least 24 h and consecutive AIS 
      patients not receiving NOAC into a prospective study. We performed standard 
      coagulation tests and specific tests for dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban 
      plasma levels. We studied 65 patients: mean age 72 ± 13 years, 30 (46 %) male, 
      median NIHSS score 3 (IQR 6). Fifteen (23 %) were on NOAC treatment (5 
      dabigatran, 5 rivaroxaban, and 5 apixaban, respectively) and 50 (77 %) were not. 
      In patients without NOAC, dabigatran was not detectable (0 ng/ml), and plasma 
      levels of rivaroxaban (median: 10.0 ng/ml, IQR 7.0) and apixaban (7.2 ng/ml, IQR 
      6.7) were below our lower thresholds that allow thrombolysis. In patients with 
      dabigatran pre-treatment, trough levels (58.0 ng/ml, IQR 143.0) were below our 
      upper threshold that would allow thrombolysis in 3/5 patients. In patients 
      receiving rivaroxaban, trough level (68.0 ng/ml, IQR 64.0) was below our 
      predefined upper thresholds that would allow thrombolysis in 4/5 patients. In all 
      patients on apixaban, trough level was above our predefined threshold of 40 ng/ml 
      that precludes thrombolysis (98.2 ng/ml, IQR 84.3). Predefined thresholds of NOAC 
      plasma levels in the decision of thrombolysis in NOAC treated AIS patients might 
      supplement routine coagulation tests and should be validated in a larger study 
      population.

TI  - Advances in oral anticoagulation treatment: the safety and efficacy of 
      rivaroxaban in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolism.
PG  - 309-323
AB  - Arterial and venous thromboembolic diseases are a clinical and economic burden 
      worldwide. In addition to traditional agents such as vitamin K antagonists and 
      heparins, newer oral agents - such as the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban, and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran - have been 
      shown to be effective across several indications. Rivaroxaban has been shown to 
      have predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, including a 
      rapid onset of action. In addition, there is no requirement for routine 
      coagulation monitoring; and no dose adjustment is necessary for age alone, sex, 
      or body weight. Rivaroxaban has successfully met primary efficacy and safety 
      endpoints in large, randomized phase III trials across several indications, 
      including: prevention of venous thromboembolism in orthopedic patients undergoing 
      elective hip or knee replacement surgery; treatment of deep vein thrombosis and 
      secondary prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; stroke 
      prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation; and secondary prevention of 
      acute coronary syndrome. Rivaroxaban and the other newer oral anticoagulants are 
      likely to improve outcomes in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic 
      events, and will offer patients and physicians alternative treatment options.

TI  - An update on laboratory assessment for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).
PG  - 33-39
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.12992 [doi]
AB  - The first direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) to be approved for clinical use was 
      dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, in 2010. Since that time, four 
      additional DOACs, all direct anti-Xa inhibitors, have been approved, including 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban. Our knowledge about the effect of 
      DOACs on laboratory testing, as well as the use of the laboratory for measuring 
      DOACs has been an evolving process. These drugs are not routinely monitored in 
      the same fashion as coumadin, but there is an increasing demand on the laboratory 
      to have the capacity to adequately assess DOAC anticoagulant effect 
      (pharmacodynamics) or levels (pharmacokinetics) in either emergent or the routine 
      situations. This manuscript provides an update on laboratory guidance and 
      progress of methods for measuring DOACs.

TI  - Drug-drug interactions of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants.
PG  - 1445-1461
AB  - The approval of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) as antithrombotic 
      alternatives to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) has changed clinical practice. 
      However, the efficacy and safety of the four most commonly used NOACs 
      (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) might be compromised by 
      co-administration of other medications used for various major comorbidities. Dose 
      adjustment of the NOACs may be needed to avert cases of concomitant medication 
      affecting NOACs absorption, metabolism and coagulation. Areas covered: This 
      review summarizes the current knowledge regarding drug-drug interactions of NOACs 
      in order to guide health professionals regarding the dose modification required 
      if the NOACs are co-administered with other medication with potential significant 
      interactions. The data were acquired from searches of PubMed and also from the 
      NOAC reports to the European Medicines Agency and Food and Drug Administration 
      Agency. Expert opinion: Most of the studies in this field have been organized by 
      pharmaceutical companies. Independent research and registries will provide more 
      information in the near future about the drug-drug interactions of NOACs. 
      P-glycoprotein transporter and cytochrome P450 enzyme complexes appear to be the 
      main pathways where the most drug-drug interactions with NOACs occur.

TI  - Novel oral anticoagulant induced upper limb haematoma: A case report.
PG  - 20-23
LID - 10.1016/j.jpra.2017.08.008 [doi]
AB  - The development of novel oral anticoagulant agents (NOACs) such as dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban has given patients better treatment 
      alternatives to aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin and warfarin, mainly for stroke 
      prophylaxis in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), 
      prophylaxis/treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and also for the secondary 
      prophylaxis of acute coronary syndromes. These agents are gaining in popularity 
      due to their more stable pharmacokinetic profile, fewer drug interactions, as 
      well as eliminating the need for routine monitoring. NOAC induced haematomas of 
      the upper limb are rare and there is no real consensus on management. We present 
      a case of a 70-year-old male on rivaroxaban who developed a delayed onset 
      intramuscular forearm haematoma after a simple fall onto his left arm. Simple 
      elevation of the limb was successful in leading to resolution of symptoms. As 
      these agents increase in popularity, clinicians need to be more aware of 
      potential risks of treatment and subsequent management.

AB  - The treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) is being completely modified 
      with the development of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Rivaroxaban, apixaban 
      and edoxaban directly inhibit factor Xa, whereas dabigatran inhibits factor IIa. 
      All these drugs are proposed orally, and share pharmacological similarities: 
      fixed doses without any therapeutic drug monitoring, key role of the transporter 
      proteins P-glycoprotein for all of them and metabolism mediated by CYP3A4 for the 
      anti-Xa, short half-life with variable rate of renal elimination. More than 25 
      000 patients with acute VTE were included in phase-III studies. Rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban challenged all the conventional therapy (parenteral heparins followed by 
      anti-vitamin K antagonists) whereas edoxaban and dabigatran challenged only 
      anti-vitamin K antagonists. All the DOACs met the non-inferiority efficacy 
      endpoint (recurrent VTE during treatment), whereas the large non-inferiority 
      margin was debated for dabigatran. However, they were associated with better 
      safety and a decreased risk of major bleeding. According to indirect comparisons, 
      there were no statistically significant differences between DOACs in terms of 
      efficacy but some differences are not excluded in term of safety. Although DOACs 
      allow for simplification of treatment in the majority of patients with acute VTE, 
      their risk/benefit ratio is questioned in elderly patients, patients with 
      mild-to-severe renal impairment, and in some clinical subgroups such as cancer or 
      chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Validated reversal strategies 
      (potentially based on laboratory monitoring) are expected for patients with major 
      bleeding, overdose or with a need for surgery.

TI  - Bleeding and thromboembolism due to drug-drug interactions with non-vitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants-a Swedish, register-based cohort study in atrial 
      fibrillation outpatients.
PG  - 409-419

AB  - PURPOSE: To study the association between interacting drugs and bleeding or 
      thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation outpatients treated with non-vitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). METHODS: Population-based cohort study of 
      outpatients treated with NOACs in Sweden from 2008 to 2017. Patients with atrial 
      fibrillation and newly initiated NOAC treatment were identified in the Prescribed 
      Drug Register. Comorbidities and outcome data were retrieved from the Patient 
      Register and the Cause of Death Register. Cox-regression analyses were performed 
      to evaluate the primary endpoints any severe bleed and ischemic stroke/transient 
      ischemic attack/stroke unspecified during the first six months of treatment. 
      Secondary endpoints were gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, 
      ischemic stroke, and venous thromboembolism. RESULTS: Increased risk of any 
      severe bleed was found when NOAC treatment, and drugs with pharmacodynamic effect 
      on bleeding were combined, compared to NOAC only. An increased risk with these 
      combinations was evident for apixaban (hazard ratio (HR) 1.47; 95% CI 1.33-1.63), 
      rivaroxaban (HR 1.7; 95% CI 1.49-1.92), and dabigatran (HR 1.26; 95% CI 
      1.05-1.52). For apixaban, there was an increased risk of any severe bleed when 
      combined with CYP3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors (HR 1.23; 95% CI 
      1.01-1.5). The use of inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp was low in this cohort, and 
      effects on ischemic stroke/TIA/stroke unspecified could not be established. 
      CONCLUSION: Increased risk of bleeding was seen for pharmacodynamic and 
      pharmacokinetic interactions with NOACs. Prescribers need to be vigilant of the 
      effect of interacting drugs on the risk profile of patients treated with NOACs.

AB  - The field of oral anticoagulation has evolved with the arrival of non-vitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) including an anti-IIa agent (dabigatran 
      etexilate) and anti-Xa agents (rivaroxaban and apixaban). The main specificities 
      of these drugs are predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics but special 
      attention should be paid in the elderly, in case of renal dysfunction and in case 
      of emergency. In addition, their perioperative management is challenging, 
      especially with the absence of specific antidotes. Effectively, periods of 
      interruption before surgery or invasive procedures depend on half-life and 
      keeping a permanent balance between bleeding and thromboembolic risks. In 
      addition, few data regarding the link between plasma concentrations and their 
      effects are provided. Routine laboratory tests are altered by NOACs and 
      quantitative measurements are not widely performed. This paper provides a review 
      on the management of NOACs in the perioperative setting, including the estimation 
      of the bleeding and thrombotic risk, the periods of interruption, the indication 
      of heparin bridging, the usefulness of laboratory tests before surgery or 
      invasive procedure, and the time of resuming. Most data are based on expert's 
      opinions.

AB  - The recent introduction of new oral anticoagulants or novel target specific oral 
      anticoagulants (TSOA's) is likely to have a major impact in the years ahead. Many 
      large clinical trials have been published in the past few years showing these 
      agents are generally safe and effective in several clinical settings including 
      acute venous thromboembolic disease, prophylaxis in the postoperative setting, 
      prevention of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, and in the 
      management of acute coronary syndromes. Reported rates of overall and 
      intracranial bleeding are lower compared to oral vitamin K antagonists. Other 
      major advantages of oral direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) and Xa 
      inhibitors (rivaroxaban and apixaban) include rapid onset and offset of action 
      and predictable pharmacodynamics with relatively wide therapeutic window allowing 
      for unmonitored drug use. The relatively short half-life, rapid onset of action, 
      and predictable pharmacokinetics should simplify periprocedural use of these 
      agents. In this review we focus on some practical issues related to TSOA's 
      including some limitations, potential complications, considerations to be made 
      for certain patient populations, periprocedural management and issues pertaining 
      to transition to and from these novel agents.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) accounts for 40% of all cardiac arrhythmias and is 
      associated with a high risk of stroke and systemic thromboembolic complications. 
      Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) that have been proven to prevent stroke in patients with non-valvular AF. 
      This review summarizes the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug 
      interactions of DOACs, as well as new data from pharmacogenetic studies of these 
      drugs. This review is aimed at analyzing the scientific literature on the gene 
      polymorphisms involved in the metabolism of DOACs. We searched PubMed, Cochrane, 
      Google Scholar, and CyberLeninka (Russian version) databases with keywords: 
      'dabigatran', 'apixaban', 'rivaroxaban', 'edoxaban', 'gene polymorphism', 
      'pharmacogenetics', 'ABCB1', 'CES1', 'SULT1A', 'ABCG2', and 'CYP3A4'. The 
      articles referred for this review include (1) full-text articles; (2) study 
      design with meta-analysis, an observational study in patients taking DOAC; and 
      (3) data on the single-nucleotide polymorphisms and kinetic parameters of DOACs 
      (plasma concentration), or a particular clinical outcome, published in English 
      and Russian languages during the last 10 years. The ages of the patients ranged 
      from 18 to 75 years. Out of 114 reviewed works, 24 were found eligible. As per 
      the available pharmacogenomic data, polymorphisms affecting DOACs are different. 
      This may aid in developing individual approaches to optimize DOAC pharmacotherapy 
      to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic complications. However, large-scale population 
      studies are required to determine the dosage of the new oral anticoagulants based 
      on genotyping. Information on the genetic effects is limited owing to the lack of 
      large-scale studies. Uncovering the mechanisms of the genetic basis of 
      sensitivity to DOACs helps in developing personalized therapy based on 
      patient-specific genetic variants and improves the efficacy and safety of DOACs 
      in the general population.

AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a prevalent, potentially fatal health problem. 
      Although standard anticoagulant therapy is effective when compared with the newer 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), it has disadvantages. Heparin and its 
      derivatives must be administered parenterally, whereas use of oral vitamin K 
      antagonists is complicated by unpredictable pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics, drug-food and drug-drug interactions and the requirement for 
      frequent laboratory monitoring. Randomized phase 3 trials have demonstrated that 
      patients receive similarly effective anticoagulation with the DOACs dabigatran, 
      edoxaban, rivaroxaban and apixaban when compared with warfarin, with similar or 
      reduced risk of bleeding. Extended therapy trials have consistently demonstrated 
      superior effectiveness for DOAC treatment when compared with placebo in 
      preventing VTE recurrence. This article presents a comprehensive review of the 
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and accumulated clinical trial evidence for 
      each DOAC for short-term, long-term and extended VTE therapy, and it considers 
      the potential implications these agents have for the clinical management of VTE.

TI  - [Pharmacology of heparins and direct anticoagulants].
PG  - 400-20
AB  - For decades, the options for therapeutic anticoagulation were limited to 
      unfractionated heparin (UFH) and vitamin K antagonists (VKA), and their 
      well-known limitations had to be accepted. With the introduction of the various 
      LMWHs, the short- and medium-term anticoagulation could be much improved, but an 
      alternative to VKA is still missing The heparins provided the proof of concept 
      that FXa and thrombin represent suitable targets for therapeutic anticoagulation. 
      Consequently, the search for new anticoagulants focuses on inhibitors of thrombin 
      (DTI) or FXa (DXI). Apart from the VKA, the anticoagulants presently available or 
      in an advanced stage of development can thus be divided in two classes: One are 
      the glyco-anticoagulants with the natural sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) 
      (UFH, LMWHs, and danaparoid) and the synthetic oligosaccharides (OS) 
      (fondaparinux, idraparinux, and SR123781A). The other class are the xenobiotic 
      anticoagulants, i.e. proteins and synthetic chemical entities. Die 
      glyco-anticoagulants act partially (GAGs) or exclusively (oligosaccharides) by 
      catalysing antithrombin, whereas the xenobiotic anticoagulants are direct 
      inhibitors of either thrombin or FXa. At present, three parenteral DTI 
      (lepirudin, argatroban, and bivalirudin) and since March 2008 one oral DTI 
      (dabigatran etexilate) are clinically used for limited indications. In September 
      2008 rivaroxaban has been approved as the first oral DXI. This review describes 
      the development of the anticoagualants as well as the pharmacological profile of 
      the clinically used anticoagualants.

AB  - Orally active small molecules that selectively and specifically inhibit 
      coagulation serine proteases have been developed for clinical use. Dabigatran 
      etexilate, rivaroxaban and apixaban are given at fixed doses and do not require 
      monitoring. In most circumstances, these drugs have predictable bioavailability, 
      pharmacokinetic effects, and pharmacodynamic effects. However, there will be 
      clinical circumstances when assessment of the anticoagulant effect of these drugs 
      will be required. The effect of these drugs on laboratory tests has been 
      determined in vitro by spiking normal samples with a known concentration of 
      active compound, or ex vivo by using plasma samples from volunteers and patients. 
      Data on the sensitivity of different reagents are now available, and so guidance 
      as to the effect and interpretation of a test result is now possible. 
      Laboratories should be aware of the sensitivity of their own assays to each drug. 
      This may be achieved by using appropriate calibrated plasma samples.

      Anticoagulants.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22168531 [doi]
LID - 8531
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in the world. For 
      almost 60 years, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the mainstay of 
      anticoagulation therapy, but in recent years direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      have become the anticoagulant treatment of choice. DOACs were initially 
      considered drugs with no significant food interactions; however, clinical 
      observations from daily practice have proved otherwise as interactions with food 
      ingredients have been reported. Food, dietary supplements or herbs may contain 
      substances that, when administered concomitantly with DOACs, can potentially 
      affect the plasma concentration of the drugs. The aim of this paper was to 
      evaluate the clinical significance of drug-food interactions of DOACs, such as 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban. Patients treated with 
      anticoagulants should avoid products containing St. John's wort and take special 
      care with other food ingredients. As the interest in dietary supplements is on 
      the rise, healthcare providers can contribute to the development of well-designed 
      clinical trials on interactions between DOACs and food, and distribute sufficient 
      knowledge about the proper use of these supplements among patients.

PG  - 32-47
LID - 10.1002/clc.22204 [doi]
AB  - Novel oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, 
      represent new options for preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, 
      as shown by the results from large, randomized phase III trials. Because of their 
      greater specificity, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics, the 
      novel oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) address several 
      limitations of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists in day-to-day clinical 
      practice. However, a range of practical questions relating to the novel oral 
      anticoagulants has emerged, including topics such as patient selection, treatment 
      of patients with renal impairment, risk of myocardial infarction, drug 
      interactions, switching between anticoagulants, and management of bleeding, in 
      addition to use of these agents in patients requiring antiplatelet drug treatment 
      or undergoing cardioversion or percutaneous interventions (eg, ablation). In this 
      review, practical aspects of the use of novel oral anticoagulants in patients 
      with atrial fibrillation are discussed, with reference to available data and 
      guidance from prescribing information.

AB  - Anticoagulation therapy is mandatory in patients with pulmonary embolism to 
      prevent significant morbidity and mortality. The mainstay of therapy has been 
      vitamin-K antagonist therapy bridged with parenteral anticoagulants. The recent 
      approval of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs: apixaban, dabigatran, and 
      rivaroxaban) has generated significant interest in their role in managing venous 
      thromboembolism, especially pulmonary embolism due to their improved 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, predictable anticoagulant response, 
      and lack of required efficacy monitoring. This paper addresses the available 
      literature, on-going clinical trials, highlights critical points, and discusses 
      potential advantages and disadvantages of the new oral anticoagulants in patients 
      with pulmonary embolism.

TI  - Management strategies of the interaction between direct oral anticoagulant and 
      drug-metabolizing enzyme inducers.

AB  - Little is known regarding the management of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in 
      patients with enzyme-inducing drugs (EID). The use of EID may lead to 
      sub-therapeutic concentrations of DOACs and to treatment failure. Thus, many 
      patients on EIDs cannot benefit from the advantages of DOACs. This was a 
      retrospective study, evaluating the management of hospitalized patients with 
      DOACs. Characteristics of hospitalized patients with a prescription for DOACs, 
      with and without EIDs, were summarized and evaluated, and management strategies 
      addressing the potential interaction were documented, including the use of DOAC 
      concentration monitoring. During the period evaluated, 1596 hospitalized patients 
      with prescriptions for DOACs were identified. Most patients received apixaban 
      (n = 1227, 77%), followed by rivaroxaban (240, 15%), and dabigatran (129, 8%). 
      Twenty-two patients (1.4%) had concomitant EIDs. Demographic and clinical 
      characteristics of hospitalized patients with DOACs were similar in those 
      receiving EID and those not. Management strategies included stopping DOAC or EID 
      (41%), and DOAC dose increase (14%). During management of these interactions, 
      DOAC concentrations were measured for 11 of 22 patients and were below the 5th 
      percentile of expected concentration for six of these patients. The management of 
      patients with DOAC concentration measurement differed significantly from those 
      without (p = 0.005), as they were much less likely to have one of the medications 
      stopped and more often had the DOACs' dose increased. Among hospitalized patients 
      with DOACs, EIDs are not rare. DOAC concentrations are often low in the presence 
      of EIDs. DOAC concentration monitoring may be useful in settings requiring both 
      DOAC and EIDs.

TI  - Evaluation of DOAC Filter, a new device to remove direct oral anticoagulants from 
      plasma samples.
PG  - 636-642
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.13267 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Directs oral anticoagulants (DOACs) can interfere with coagulation 
      assays, especially in thrombophilia workup. To avoid these interferences, a new 
      device, DOAC Filter, allows the removal of DOACs from citrated plasma. This study 
      aims to confirm that DOAC Filter efficiently removes DOACs and to ascertain that 
      coagulation assays are not impacted by filtration. METHODS: Directs oral 
      anticoagulants Filter (Diagnostica Stago, France) is a filtration cartridge in 
      which DOAC molecules are trapped by noncovalent binding, while plasma is filtered 
      through a solid phase. Normal pool plasma (NPP) spiked with DOACs up to 
      300 ng/mL, with dabigatran etexilate (n = 27), rivaroxaban (n = 35), apixaban 
      (n = 33), and edoxaban (n = 27) or 120 ng/mL for betrixaban (n = 4), and 18 
      plasma's samples from DOAC-treated patients were used to assess efficacy. The 
      potential impact of DOAC Filter on coagulation assays was evaluated with NPP and 
      plasma's samples from positive and negative lupus anticoagulant (LA) patients. 
      RESULTS: Directs oral anticoagulants concentrations measured after filtration 
      were below the limit of detection (LoD) of DOAC-specific assays for all plasmas 
      tested, except for one apixaban plasma sample, with postfiltration concentration 
      slightly higher than anti-Xa assay LoD (25.1 ng/mL). Coagulation assays results 
      varied between -4 and +8% after filtration and between -6 and +8% for LA plasmas. 
      Such limited variations are not expected to have any clinical impact. CONCLUSION: 
      Directs oral anticoagulants Filter efficiently removes DOACs from plasma and 
      achieves concentrations below DOAC-specific assays LoD, except in the case of one 
      apixaban sample. The integrity of plasma is respected, and the cartridge seems 
      not to impact LA diagnosis.

TI  - Deep vein thrombosis and novel oral anticoagulants: a clinical review.
PG  - 3123-31
LID - 6038 [pii]
AB  - Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common disease associated with high rates of 
      mortality and significant morbidity. The diagnostic approach of DVT has evolved 
      over the years. Algorithmical use of pretest probability, D-Dimer testing and 
      ultrasonography allow safe and accurate investigation of DVT. The anticoagulation 
      therapy, used to treat DVT, includes vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and 
      low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UF). The duration 
      of anticoagulation therapy depends on the cause of DVT and patient's clinical 
      profile. Although these conventional therapies are effective, narrow therapeutic 
      index, need for frequent monitoring and various food-drug interactions cause 
      difficulties for patients. In recent decades, new oral anticoagulants have been 
      developed. These drugs focus directly on inhibiting either Factor Xa 
      (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) or thrombin (dabigatran). In contrast to 
      warfarin, these new agents have shorter half-life, fewer drug or food 
      interactions, no necessity for a close monitoring and ease of administration. 
      This review summarizes current knowledge about deep vein thrombosis and new 
      treatment aspects with novel oral anticoagulants.

TI  - Comprehensive review of the impact of direct oral anticoagulants on thrombophilia 
      diagnostic tests: Practical recommendations for the laboratory.
PG  - 7-20
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.13342 [doi]
AB  - There is a laboratory and clinical need to know the impact of direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) on diagnostic tests to avoid misinterpretation of results. 
      Although the regulatory labelling documents provide some information about the 
      influences of each DOAC on diagnostic tests, these are usually limited to some of 
      the most common tests and no head to head comparison is available. In this paper, 
      we report the impact of DOACs on several thrombophilia tests, including 
      assessment of antithrombin, protein S and protein C activity assays, detection of 
      activated protein C resistance and assays used for lupus anticoagulant. Results 
      are compared and discussed with data obtained from literature. The final goal of 
      this comprehensive review is to provide practical recommendations for 
      laboratories to avoid misdiagnosis due to oral direct factor Xa (FXa) or IIa 
      (FIIa) inhibitors. Overall, oral direct FXa (apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban and 
      rivaroxaban) and FIIa (dabigatran) antagonists may affect clot-based 
      thrombophilia diagnostic tests resulting in false-positive or false-negative 
      results. An effect on FIIa-based thrombophilia diagnostic tests is observed with 
      dabigatran but not with anti-FXa DOACs and conversely for FXa-based thrombophilia 
      diagnostic tests. No impact was observed with antigenic/chromogenic methods for 
      the assessment of protein S and C activity. In conclusion, interpretation of 
      thrombophilia diagnostic tests results should be done with caution in patients on 
      DOACs. The use of a device/chemical compound able to remove or antagonize the 
      effect of DOACs or the development of new diagnostic tests insensitive to DOACs 
      should be considered to minimize the risk of false results.

TI  - Apixaban: a new factor Xa inhibitor for stroke prevention in patients with 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 207-12

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke 
      occurrence, severity, recurrence, and mortality. Anticoagulation therapy for the 
      prevention of thromboembolism is critical in patients with AF who are at risk of 
      stroke. Warfarin has been an efficacious anticoagulant for this purpose, but its 
      use has been limited by frequent laboratory monitoring, drug interactions, 
      unpredictable individual response, delayed onset of action, and bleeding. 
      Apixaban is the second oral direct selective factor Xa inhibitor approved for the 
      prevention of stroke/systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. It was 
      significantly better than aspirin in reducing stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or 
      systemic embolism without increasing the risk of major bleeding in patients with 
      AF who were at increased risk of stroke and for whom warfarin was unsuitable. In 
      a randomized, double-blind trial that was originally designed to test for 
      noninferiority, apixaban was superior to warfarin (target international 
      normalized ratio 2-3) in preventing stroke or systemic embolism, caused less 
      bleeding, and resulted in lower mortality in patients with AF. Apixaban has a 
      half-life of about 12 hours, and the normal dosage is 5 mg orally twice daily. 
      However, it may be reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily based on individual factors of 
      the patient (age, renal function, and body weight) and the concomitant use of 
      potent dual inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein. Similar to 
      other novel oral anticoagulants (dabigatran and rivaroxaban), apixaban has no 
      reversal agent for its anticoagulant effect. Overall, apixaban is a safe and 
      efficacious alternative for stroke prophylaxis in high-risk patients who have AF 
      and who are unable to achieve therapeutic goals with warfarin therapy.

TI  - An update on laboratory measurements of Dabigatran: Smart specific and calibrated 
      dedicated assays for measuring anti-IIa activity in plasma.

AB  - Use of Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) is continuously increasing for clinical 
      application. The first product released was Dabigatran, which was proposed for 
      many preventive and curative applications, especially for prevention of stroke in 
      patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Although measurement of 
      Dabigatran Anti-IIa activity in plasma is not requested on a routine basis, in 
      some situations its measurement is clinically useful. Especially, before an 
      emergency surgery in treated patients, where its presence at high concentrations, 
      which will expose the patient at an increased bleeding risk, has to be excluded. 
      Hence, smart, specific, rapid and accurate quantitative assays are warranted as 
      an essential required. Hemoclot™ Thrombin Inhibitors and Biophen® DTI were 
      specifically designed for these applications, and can be used on all automated 
      instruments with a standard range protocol for measuring concentrations at peak, 
      or with a low range protocol for testing residual concentrations. Both functional 
      assays have a good correlation with the reference LC-MS/MS method, and 
      concentrations measured are similar. Performances of these assays and 
      interferences of various substances or drugs are discussed. Some differences in 
      variations of clotting times are observed between mechanical or optical clot 
      detection instruments, which could be explained by the fibrin clot structure, 
      altered by direct Factor Xa inhibitors, and more especially Rivaroxaban. Both 
      clotting and chromogenic assays offer a safe and accurate quantitative 
      measurement of Dabigatran in plasma in all situations where this determination is 
      requested. In short this manuscript provides an in depth update on current 
      opinions on laboratory aspects of measuring Dabigatran concentrations in plasma, 
      when required.

TI  - The Relationship between the Initial Anti-factor Xa Measurement and the Duration 
      of Direct Oral Anticoagulant Influence in Patients Transitioning to Heparin.
PG  - 880-888
LID - 10.1002/phar.2444 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anticoagulation monitoring during transition from direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOAC) to heparin infusions is a significant challenge. Factor Xa 
      inhibitors influence the heparin calibrated antifactor Xa assay. The University 
      of Virginia (UVA) Medical Center utilized a corrected antifactor Xa assay (c-AXA) 
      during this transition period, which removes DOAC-mediated antifactor Xa activity 
      (d-AXA) and reflects heparin-specific activity. Currently, the duration of this 
      influence is not well described. STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study had two aims: to 
      determine if the initial d-AXA is predictive of the duration of DOAC influence 
      and to further characterize this influence among different patient populations. 
      METHODS: This retrospective study included adult patients admitted to UVA Medical 
      Center between September 2016 and March 2017, with c-AXA measurements, who 
      received apixaban or rivaroxaban within 48 hours before heparin initiation. A 
      Pearson correlation test, Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis, and multivariate linear 
      regression were used to assess the relationship between initial d-AXA and 
      duration of influence. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients met inclusion criteria and 
      were maintained on either apixaban (85%) or rivaroxaban (15%) before heparin 
      initiation. The initial d-AXA ranged from 0.11 to 3.27 IU/ml. The mean duration 
      of influence was 69.3 ± 46.2 hours, with a median duration of 62.7 hours. No 
      strong correlation was identified between initial d-AXA and duration of influence 
      (R(2) = 0.124). Presence of interacting medications significantly increased 
      duration of influence (p=0.012). No significant difference in duration of 
      influence existed between patients with normal renal function and those with 
      dynamic renal function (p=0.84), or with body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 
      kg/m(2) (p=0.16). CONCLUSIONS: The initial d-AXA was not predictive of duration 
      of influence in patients transitioning from DOACs to heparin infusion; however, 
      the median duration of influence suggests influence may be present for longer 
      than currently stated in the literature, especially in those taking interacting 
      medications.

TI  - Bioequivalence and Food Effect Assessment Between 2 Oral Tablet Formulations of 
      Rivaroxaban 20 mg in Healthy Chinese Subjects.
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.1511 [doi]
AB  - To evaluate the bioequivalence and safety of oral rivaroxaban tablets between a 
      test formulation and a reference formulation in healthy Chinese subjects, a 
      randomized, open, 2-formulation, 4-cycle, complete repeat crossover study was 
      conducted under both fasting and fed states. Thirty-six healthy participants were 
      enrolled separately for the fasting and fed groups, and each subject received a 
      single oral dose of 20 mg of the test or reference formulation of rivaroxaban 
      tablets per cycle. Blood samples were collected at specified intervals, and 
      rivaroxaban was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 
      Under fasting and fed conditions, the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the 
      geometric mean ratios of the maximum concentration (C(max)), the area under the 
      plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last measurable time point 
      (AUC(0-t)), and the area under the curve extrapolated to infinity from time 0 
      (AUC(0-∞)) all fell within the 80%-125% CI, and the upper limit of the 90% CIs 
      for the test-to-reference ratio of the within-subject variability was <2.5. This 
      indicated that the test formulation of rivaroxaban is bioequivalent to the 
      reference formulation. Compared to the fasted state, the C(max), AUC(0-t), and 
      AUC(0-∞) of rivaroxaban increased significantly by factors of 2, 1.6, and 1.5, 
      respectively, following oral administration of 20 mg of rivaroxaban in the fed 
      state. This suggests that a high-fat diet significantly enhances the exposure to 
      rivaroxaban. No serious adverse events were reported under fasting or fed 
      conditions.

AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is very uncommon in children and adolescents 
      compared with older adults, though its incidence has significantly increased over 
      the past two decades. Given the rarity of the condition, the data on pediatric 
      VTE lag behind the adult experience and consequently the management of VTE in 
      children is, in large part, modeled on the adult strategies. This approach has 
      certain limitations, given that young children have developmental particularities 
      of the hemostatic system and differences in the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of various anticoagulant agents. The most commonly used 
      anticoagulants in children continue to be the heparins and the vitamin K 
      antagonists. Direct intravenous thrombin inhibitors, argatroban, bivalirudin, 
      have very limited pediatric use. The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant 
      drugs (novel oral anticoagulants) present potential advantages in terms of 
      efficacy, safety, and convenience, though pediatric data are limited to 
      preclinical and small phase I trials. There are several ongoing phase I, II, and 
      III trials for dabigatran rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, the results of 
      which are likely to change the future management of pediatric thromboses.

LID - 1371
AB  - Objective: This study's objective was to evaluate the effects of pharmacokinetic 
      and pharmacogenetic factors on major bleeding in patients with ACS and 
      non-valvular AF receiving combined antithrombotic therapy consisting of 
      rivaroxaban, clopidogrel, and aspirin as part of dual or triple therapy. Methods: 
      A prospective observational study was conducted in two PCI centers in Moscow, the 
      Russian Federation, from 2017 to 2018. One hundred patients with ACS and AF were 
      enrolled. Prospective follow-ups continued for 12 months. Results: A total of 36 
      patients experienced bleeding events, with 10 experiencing major bleeding based 
      on the BARC scale and 17 experiencing major bleeding based on the ISTH scale. The 
      following predictors associated with an increased number of major bleeding events 
      were identified: for the ISTH scale, a Css min. of rivaroxaban of >137 pg/mL 
      (5.94 OR, (95% CI, 3.13-12.99; p < 0.004)) and carriage of the T allelic variant 
      polymorphism ABCB1 rs4148738 (8.97 OR (95% CI, 1.48-14.49; p < 0.017)), as well 
      as for the BARC scale (5.76 OR (95% CI, 2.36-9.87; p < 0.018)). Conclusions: 
      Measuring residual steady-state rivaroxaban concentrations and determining the 
      carriage of the T allelic variant polymorphism ABCB1 rs4148738 may be applicable 
      to high-risk patients for subsequent antithrombotic therapy modification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Apixaban and rivaroxaban are activated factor X (FXa) inhibitors 
      commonly used for treatment of venous thromboembolism and stroke prevention in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation. While routine monitoring of their 
      concentrations is not recommended, but it may be beneficial in certain 
      situations. Expected peak and trough concentrations remain poorly understood, 
      with most data derived from small studies. OBJECTIVES: To establish the average 
      peak and trough concentrations of apixaban and rivaroxaban from real-world 
      studies. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched until October 
      2023 for observational studies reporting apixaban and rivaroxaban concentrations. 
      Meta-regression was used to examine factors influencing these concentrations. 
      RESULTS: Sixteen studies involving 1054 apixaban and 1321 rivaroxaban patients 
      were pooled using random-effects model. Mean apixaban peak concentrations were 
      157 ng/mL (95% CI, 127-187) for 2.5 mg and 228 ng/mL (95% CI, 204-252) for 5 mg, 
      with trough concentrations of 77 ng/mL (95% CI, 56-98) and 113 ng/mL (95% CI, 
      101-124), respectively. Mean rivaroxaban peak concentrations were 168 ng/mL (95% 
      CI, 104-232) for 10 mg, 225 ng/mL (95% CI, 192-257) for 15 mg, and 229 ng/mL (95% 
      CI, 193-264) for 20 mg, with trough concentrations of 23 ng/mL (95% CI, 13-32), 
      31 ng/mL (95% CI, 26-36), and 36 ng/mL (95% CI, 25-47), respectively. 
      Meta-regression revealed age and creatinine clearance correlated with apixaban 
      peak concentrations. Creatinine clearance correlated with apixaban and 
      rivaroxaban trough concentrations. CONCLUSION: The pooled mean concentrations 
      align with expected concentration ranges reported in different pharmacokinetic 
      studies.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants that target a single coagulation factor (such as 
      factor Xa or thrombin) have been developed in recent years in an attempt to 
      address some of the limitations of traditional anticoagulants. Rivaroxaban is an 
      oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor that inhibits free and clot-bound factor Xa and 
      factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex. Preclinical studies demonstrated a 
      potent anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban in plasma as well as the ability of 
      this agent to prevent and treat venous and arterial thrombosis in animal models. 
      These studies led to an extensive phase I clinical development program that 
      investigated the pharmacological properties of rivaroxaban in humans. In these 
      studies, rivaroxaban was shown to exhibit predictable pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics and to have no clinically relevant interactions with many 
      commonly prescribed co-medications. The pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban 
      (for example, inhibition of factor Xa and prolongation of prothrombin time) were 
      closely correlated with rivaroxaban concentrations in plasma. The encouraging 
      findings from preclinical and early clinical studies were expanded upon in large, 
      randomized phase III studies, which demonstrated the clinical efficacy and safety 
      of rivaroxaban in a broad spectrum of patients. This article provides an overview 
      of the discovery and development of rivaroxaban, describing the pharmacodynamic 
      profile established in preclinical studies and the optimal translation to 
      clinical studies in healthy subjects and patient populations.

AB  - We report a patient who presented a non-ST segment elevation myocardial 
      infarction in the context of severe normocytic hypochromic anemia related to 
      gastrointestinal bleeding, 3 months after switching anticoagulant from the 
      vitamin K antagonist acenocoumarol to the direct oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban. 
      High levels of both anti-Xa activity and rivaroxaban plasma concentrations were 
      measured despite rivaroxaban withdrawal, suggesting reduced elimination/drug 
      clearance. Estimated half-life was 2-3 times longer than usually reported. The 
      patient is a homozygous carrier of ABCB1 variant alleles, which could have 
      participated to reduced elimination of rivaroxaban. Furthermore, CYP3A4/5 
      phenotyping showed moderately reduced enzyme activity. Drug-drug interaction with 
      simvastatin may have contributed to decreased rivaroxaban elimination. Although 
      in the present case moderate acute renal failure probably played a role, more 
      clinical data are required to elucidate the impact of ABCB1 polymorphism on 
      rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and bleeding complications.

TI  - A Combined Pharmacometrics Analysis of Biomarker Distribution Under Treatment 
      With Standard- or Low-Dose Rivaroxaban in Real-World Chinese Patients With 
      Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 814724

LID - 814724
AB  - Background: The rivaroxaban dose regimen for patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF) is complex in Asia. Given the high interindividual 
      variability and the risk of bleeding caused by rivaroxaban in Asians, the 
      influencing factors and the relationship between outlier biomarkers and bleeding 
      events need exploration. Methods: The integrated pharmacokinetics 
      (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) models were characterized based on rich PK/PD data 
      from 304 healthy volunteers and sparse PD [anti-factor Xa activity (anti-Xa) and 
      prothrombin (PT)] data from 223 patients with NVAF. The correlations between PD 
      biomarkers and clinically relevant bleedings in 1 year were explored. The final 
      integrated PK/PD model was used to evaluate the influence of dosage and 
      individual covariates on PD parameters. Results: A two-compartment, linear model 
      with sequential zero-order and first-order absorption was adopted. The 
      dose-specific relative bioavailability (F(1)), diet status, creatinine clearance, 
      and body mass index (BMI) improved the model fit. The apparent systemic clearance 
      was 7.39 L/h, and the central and peripheral volumes were 10.9 and 50.9 L, 
      respectively. The linear direct-effects model with shape factor plus the additive 
      (and/or proportional) error model described the correlation between anti-Xa/PT 
      and plasma concentration. Bodyweight, total cholesterol (TCHO), and diet status 
      were selected as the covariates of the anti-Xa/PT model. Anti-Xa was more 
      sensitive to the increase in rivaroxaban exposure compared with PT. An elevated 
      bleeding tendency was seen with higher peak anti-Xa and PT. For a typical Chinese 
      patient, the peak anti-Xa value (median (5%-95% PI)) of 20 and 15 mg were 
      309 ng/ml (139-597 ng/ml) and 296 ng/ml (138-604 ng/ml), both median values were 
      within the expected range. For patients with CrCL 30-49 ml/min, the median peak 
      anti-Xa with recommended 10 mg other than 15 mg were within the expected range. 
      Conclusion: Fixed doses of rivaroxaban could be prescribed for patients with NVAF 
      without adjustment for bodyweight, BMI, and TCHO. Randomized studies should be 
      performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose rivaroxaban in Chinese 
      patients with NVAF.

TI  - Long-term anticoagulation in the extreme elderly with the newer antithrombotics: 
      safe or sorry?
PG  - 287-92
LID - 10.4070/kcj.2013.43.5.287 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) doubles in 
      the extreme elderly and is higher than in the rest of the population. Warfarin 
      therapy to prevent thromboembolic events secondary to AF is often underutilized 
      and under-prescribed in this subgroup, due to the fear of bleeding and other 
      complications. Newer oral anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban and dabigatran offer 
      alternative therapeutic options for the extreme elderly. We review the clinical 
      trial data of these newer agents in the extreme elderly population. SUBJECTS AND 
      METHODS: THE PRIMARY LITERATURE WAS IDENTIFIED THROUGH PUBMED, USING THE 
      FOLLOWING SEARCH TERMS: anticoagulation, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, warfarin, 
      elderly, AF, bleeding, stroke, and aging. Additional references were identified 
      through the review of references from the articles obtained. We included clinical 
      studies evaluating anticoagulation therapies in AF. Selection emphasis was placed 
      on those evaluating anticoagulation in the elderly population. RESULTS: 
      Dabigatran and rivaroxaban have predictable, dose-proportional pharmacokinetic 
      and pharmacodynamic properties, which make them favorable options for the 
      elderly. Fewer monitoring parameters and drug interactions allow for the greater 
      ease of use. A landmark trial shows that the rate of intracranial hemorrhage with 
      dabigatran is lower in this population compared to warfarin. However, the data is 
      based on a small number of subjects enrolled in the clinical trials. As such, the 
      real-world use of these agents may not replicate the published rates of bleeding 
      and thrombosis in the study populations. CONCLUSION: More research is needed in 
      this area, specifically in this population, before newer agents such as 
      rivaroxaban and dabigatran are widely recommended for use in the extreme elderly 
      patients.

TI  - Which patients may benefit from dose adjustment of non-vitamin K antagonist oral 
      anticoagulants?
PG  - 195-207
LID - 10.1055/s-0035-1546465 [doi]
AB  - The commercially available non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) 
      are an emerging therapeutic class, which includes dabigatran, rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban. Dose adjustment of the NOAC currently takes into account 
      the presence of particular patient characteristics that may alter NOAC 
      concentrations. These characteristics include the presence of renal impairment 
      and concomitant drugs affecting proteins involved with the transport and 
      metabolism of the NOAC. NOAC concentrations reflect anticoagulant activity; some 
      studies have shown some correlation with the risks of adverse events, while 
      others have not, and the association is debated by workers in the field. However, 
      dose adjustment based on characteristics before dosing assumes that the patient 
      has drug oral availability and clearance at the mean of patients with these 
      characteristics. Direct quantification of NOAC concentrations, for example, 
      through the use of calibrated coagulation assays, is likely to add further to 
      individualization of dosing to the particular patient.

TI  - [Interference of oral anti-Xa anticoagulants during monitoring of unfractionated 
      heparin treatments: practical and future attitudes].
PG  - 129-138
LID - 10.1684/abc.2024.1873 [doi]
AB  - Contrary to direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), unfractionated heparin (UFH) 
      requires daily monitoring when administered at therapeutic dose. At present, UFH 
      monitoring is preferably carried out by measuring plasma anti-Xa activity, 
      however, in patients previously treated with an anti-Xa DOAC and switched to UFH, 
      there is a high risk of DOAC interfering with the measurement of UFH anti-Xa 
      activity. Residual anti-Xa DOAC in the sample can lead to an overestimation of 
      the anticoagulant activity attributed to heparin and thus to incorrect 
      anticoagulation. This risk of interference should not be overlooked because 
      interference may occur even at concentration of DOAC below the hemostatic safety 
      threshold and can last several days. To overcome this issue, several alternatives 
      are being studied. This note provides an update on anti-Xa DOAC interference and 
      different strategies available in current practice. It also underlines the 
      importance of communication between biologists and clinicians on anticoagulant 
      treatments received by patients.

TI  - Application of the Population Pharmacokinetics Model-Based Approach to the 
      Prediction of Drug-Drug Interaction between Rivaroxaban and Carbamazepine in 
      Humans.
LID - 10.3390/ph16050684 [doi]
LID - 684
AB  - Rivaroxaban (RIV) is one of the direct oral anticoagulants used to prevent and 
      treat venous and arterial thromboembolic events. Considering the therapeutic 
      indications, RIV is likely to be concomitantly administered with various other 
      drugs. Among these is carbamazepine (CBZ), one of the recommended first-line 
      options to control seizures and epilepsy. RIV is a strong substrate of cytochrome 
      P450 (CYP) enzymes and Pgp/BCRP efflux transporters. Meanwhile, CBZ is well known 
      as a strong inducer of these enzymes and transporters. Therefore, drug-drug 
      interaction (DDI) between CBZ and RIV is expected. This study aimed to predict 
      the DDI profile of CBZ and RIV in humans by using a population pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) model-based approach. We previously investigated the population PK 
      parameters of RIV administered alone or with CBZ in rats. In this study, those 
      parameters were extrapolated from rats to humans by using simple allometry and 
      liver blood flow scaling, and then applied to back-simulate the PK profiles of 
      RIV in humans (20 mg RIV per day) used alone or with CBZ (900 mg CBZ per day). 
      Results showed that CBZ significantly reduced RIV exposure. The AUC(inf) and 
      C(max) of RIV decreased by 52.3% and 41.0%, respectively, following the first RIV 
      dose, and by 68.5% and 49.8% at the steady state. Therefore, the 
      co-administration of CBZ and RIV warrants caution. Further studies investigating 
      the extent of DDIs between these drugs should be conducted in humans to fully 
      understand their safety and effects.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anticoagulants in paediatric patients.
PG  - 967-80
AB  - Given the rising incidence of thrombotic complications in paediatric patients, 
      understanding of the pharmacologic behaviour of anticoagulant drugs in children 
      has gained importance. Significant developmental differences between children and 
      adults in the haemostatic system and pharmacologic parameters for individual 
      drugs highlight potentially unique aspects of anticoagulant pharmacology in this 
      special and vulnerable population. This review focuses on pharmacologic 
      information relevant to the dosing of unfractionated heparin, low molecular 
      weight heparin, warfarin, bivalirudin, argatroban and fondaparinux in paediatric 
      patients. The bulk of clinical experience with paediatric anticoagulation rests 
      with the first three of these agents, each of which requires higher 
      bodyweight-based dosing for the youngest patients, compared with adults, in order 
      to achieve comparable pharmacodynamic effects, likely related to an inverse 
      correlation between age and bodyweight-normalized clearance of these drugs. 
      Whether extrapolation of therapeutic ranges targeted for adult patients 
      prescribed these agents is valid for children, however, is unknown and a high 
      priority for future research. Novel oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban, hold promise for future use in paediatrics but require 
      further pharmacologic study in infants, children and adolescents.

AB  - Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) typically exhibit a predictable 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic response at a fixed dose, not necessitating 
      monitoring under standard conditions. Yet, in specific clinical scenarios that 
      can impair it, like Congenital Nephrotic Syndrome (CNS) or Short Bowel Syndrome 
      (SBS) due to absorption issues, anti-thrombin III (AT-III) deficiency and 
      non-selective proteinuria, adjusting the dosage to achieve appropriate plasma 
      concentrations could prove beneficial. We report a 3-month-old female with 
      catheter-related jugular thrombosis affected by CNS concomitant to SBS and 
      failure of both treatments with heparin and warfarin, that was switched to 
      dose-adjusted pediatric rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban was adjusted to reach peak 
      levels between 189 and 419 ng/ml and the lower trough levels between 6 and 
      87 ng/ml. Increasing doses were needed due to SBS related malabsorption but a 
      complete permeabilization of the vein was achieved without bleeding 
      complications. The use of anti-Xa adjusted rivaroxaban could be an alternative to

TI  - The Development and Optimization of Hot-Melt Extruded Amorphous Solid Dispersions 
      Containing Rivaroxaban in Combination with Polymers.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13030344 [doi]
LID - 344
AB  - Rivaroxaban (RXB), a novel oral anticoagulant that directly inhibits factor Xa, 
      is a poorly soluble drug belonging to Biopharmaceutics Classification System 
      (BCS) class II. In this study, a hot-melt extruded amorphous solid dispersion 
      (HME-ASD) containing RXB is prepared by changing the drug:polymer ratio 
      (Polyvinylpyrrolidione-vinyl acetate 64, 1:1-1:4) and barrel temperature (200-240 
      °C), fixed at 20% of Cremophor(®) RH 40 and 15 rpm of the screw speed, using the 
      hot-melt extruding technique. This study evaluates the solubility, dissolution 
      behavior, and bioavailability for application to oral drug delivery and optimizes 
      the formulation of rivaroxaban amorphous solid dispersion (RXB-ASD). Based on a 
      central composite design, optimized RXB-ASD (PVP VA 64 ratio 1:4.1, barrel 
      temperature 216.1 °C, Cremophor(®) RH 40 20%, screw speed 15 rpm) showed 
      satisfactory results for dependent variables. An in vitro drug dissolution study 
      exhibited relatively high dissolution in four media and achieved around an 80% 
      cumulative drug release in 120 min. Optimized RXB-ASD was stable under the 
      accelerated condition for three months without a change in crystallinity and the 
      dissolution rate. A pharmacokinetic study of RXB-ASD in rats showed that the 
      absorption was markedly increased in terms of rate and amount, i.e., the systemic 
      exposure values, compared to raw RXB powder. These results showed the application 
      of quality by design (QbD) in the formulation development of hot-melt extruded 
      RXB-ASD, which can be used as an oral drug delivery system by increasing the 
      dissolution rate and bioavailability.

TI  - Reduced Anticoagulant Effect of Dabigatran in a Patient Receiving Concomitant 
      Phenytoin.
PG  - e5-7
LID - 10.1002/phar.1698 [doi]
AB  - Dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is an oral anticoagulant indicated for 
      the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and for the 
      treatment and prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. 
      Dabigatran, as well as the other new anticoagulants-rivaroxaban, apixaban, and 
      edoxaban-are substrates for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Although the U.S. labeling for 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban states to avoid concomitant use with phenytoin, a known 
      P-gp inducer, the U.S. labeling for dabigatran and edoxaban are less clear. We 
      describe the first case report, to our knowledge, documenting a drug interaction 
      between phenytoin and dabigatran by using laboratory measurements of dabigatran 
      serum concentrations. A 45-year-old African-American man was admitted to the 
      inpatient cardiology service following defibrillations from his implantable 
      cardioverter defibrillator. The patient was evaluated and received appropriate 
      antitachycardia pacing for atrial tachyarrhythmias for an episode of ventricular 
      tachycardia (VT), and antiarrhythmic therapy with sotalol was initiated to reduce 
      both his AF and VT burden. On review of the patient's medications for potential 
      interactions, it was discovered that the patient was taking both dabigatran and 
      phenytoin. To determine the magnitude of this drug interaction prior to making a 
      change in his anticoagulation regimen, a dabigatran serum concentration was 
      measured. This concentration was undetectable, indicating that phenytoin had a 
      significant influence on dabigatran's metabolism and that this patient was at 
      high risk for stroke. Clinicians should be aware of this interaction between 
      phenytoin and dabigatran as well as with all other new oral anticoagulants. In 
      patients taking phenytoin who require an anticoagulant, only warfarin should be 
      prescribed to minimize the risk of stroke. In addition, the prescribing 
      information for dabigatran should be updated to include other medications that 
      result in a significant reduction in dabigatran serum concentrations, such as 
      phenytoin.

PG  - 66-9
AB  - The search for the ideal anticoagulant has been one of the most active research 
      fields in medicine in the past few years. Anti-vitamin K replacement, 
      particularly in the long term treatment of venous thromboembolism is a difficult 
      objective to achieve due to the wide experience gathered in normal practice and 
      low costs. But to improve the weak points of these drugs is an attractive 
      challenge and would have a great health and social impact. It can be seen that 
      the low molecular weight heparins, or even pentasaccharide, drugs that are 
      already available on the market, although the have very predictable 
      pharmacokinetics, their parenteral use, or their long half life, they are far 
      from being ideal anticoagulants. Ximelagatran, a promising drug, a direct 
      inhibitor of thrombin seemed to be a step forward, but the appearance of 
      undesirable side effects led to its withdrawal. However, this line of 
      investigation has remained open, as such that we now have data from clinical 
      trials that back it up: the direct inhibition of thrombin and activated factor X. 
      These two different mechanisms of action are showing promising results, in that 
      the direct inhibitors of thrombin (dabigatran, hirudins...) are showing not to be 
      inferior in efficacy and safety to enoxaparin in the primary prophylaxis of 
      venous thromboembolism. Similarly, the activated factor X inhibitors 
      (Rivaroxaban, Apixaban ) are also showing the same and in some cases, superior in 
      its prevention. This review looks at the mechanisms of action of both 
      pharmacological groups, their effects on haemostasis, and how they are reflected 
      in coagulation times, their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These new 
      anticoagulants are nearer to the ideal anticoagulant and may, in the near future, 
      change the panorama of anticoagulation, not only at health level, but also by 
      achieving improved levels in the quality of life of the patients.

PG  - 195-202
LID - 10.1007/s11239-013-0923-y [doi]
AB  - The target-specific oral anticoagulants represent the first new oral 
      anti-thrombotic therapy in over 50 years and have the potential to make therapy 
      easier and hence more accessible to many patients. Like any new therapy, the 
      potential benefits must be weighed against the potential challenges and one of 
      the most concerning aspects of the new target-specific oral anticoagulants is the 
      lack of a proven method to reverse their effect. Unlike the vitamin K antagonist, 
      i.e. warfarin, there is no specific antidote for these medications. This paper 
      will review the limited data on the use of non-specific therapies to reverse 
      anticoagulation for the new agents. We hope to prepare clinicians who are faced 
      with a patient who has serious bleeding or needs emergent surgery while taking 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban.

TI  - Apixaban Interacts with Haemoglobin: Effects on Its Plasma Levels.
PG  - 1701-1712
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1669920 [doi]
AB  - The direct oral anticoagulant apixaban (APX), a strong factor Xa inhibitor, binds 
      also to plasma proteins, especially albumin, and minimally to α(1)-acid 
      glycoprotein. Although APX can cross the red cell membrane, due to its chemical 
      structure, and could bind to haemoglobin (Hb), no investigation was performed on 
      this possible phenomenon that could affect the APX plasma concentration and thus 
      its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We addressed this issue by (1) 
      measuring the levels of APX and haematological/biochemical parameters in 90 
      patients on APX therapy; (2) assessing the effect of APX on oxygen saturation 
      curves of Hb; (3) testing the direct APX binding to Hb by fluorescence 
      spectroscopy and a zinc-induced precipitation of Hb coupled to a reversed-phase 
      high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based method; and (4) simulating in 
      silico by molecular docking the APX interaction with human Hb. In a multivariable 
      analysis, Hb was the only independent variable significantly and inversely 
      associated in 90 patients with APX peak plasma level, at variance with patients 
      treated with rivaroxaban (n = 86) and dabigatran (n = 34) therapy. APX causes a 
      progressive left-shift of the oxygen dissociation curve of purified Hb solution, 
      with a K(d) ≅300 µM. Fluorescence- and HPLC-based assays concordantly showed that 
      APX binds to Hb with a K(d) ≅350 µM. Finally, docking simulations showed that APX 
      can fit into in the central cavity of Hb. These findings support the hypothesis 
      that APX does bind to Hb, which, due to its millimolar concentration in blood, 
      can act as 'buffer' for the drug and consequently affect its free plasma level.

AB  - Thrombin inhibitors and direct factor Xa inhibitors represent a major 
      breakthrough in the field of anticoagulation pharmacotherapy. These novel agents 
      have replaced warfarin as the oral anticoagulant of choice in certain 
      indications, as they possess equal or superior efficacy and better safety 
      profiles. They have a quick onset of action, predictable pharmacokinetic 
      properties and minimal drug and food interactions. So they do not require 
      frequent blood monitoring and dose adjustments as with warfarin. Considering all 
      the advantages, there seems to be a rapid increase in the number of patients who 
      are started on these novel anticoagulants. In this review, we highlight the 
      pharmacology of these direct oral anticoagulants and the evidence-based 
      indications for their use. We aim to provide a clinical overview for the 
      non-specialist who may be called upon to manage a patient who is currently on one 
      of these novel anticoagulants.

TI  - Impact of the Genotype and Phenotype of CYP3A and P-gp on the Apixaban and 
      Rivaroxaban Exposure in a Real-World Setting.
LID - 10.3390/jpm12040526 [doi]
LID - 526
AB  - Apixaban and rivaroxaban are the two most prescribed direct factor Xa inhibitors. 
      With the increased use of DOACs in real-world settings, safety and efficacy 
      concerns have emerged, particularly regarding their concomitant use with other 
      drugs. Increasing evidence highlights drug−drug interactions with CYP3A/P-gp 
      modulators leading to adverse events. However, current recommendations for dose 
      adjustment do not consider CYP3A/P-gp genotype and phenotype. We aimed to 
      determine their impact on apixaban and rivaroxaban blood exposure. Three-hundred 
      hospitalized patients were included. CYP3A and P-gp phenotypic activities were 
      assessed by the metabolic ratio of midazolam and AUC0−6h of fexofenadine, 
      respectively. Relevant CYP3A and ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms were also tested. 
      Capillary blood samples collected at four time-points after apixaban or 
      rivaroxaban administration allowed the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. 
      According to the developed multivariable linear regression models, P-gp activity 
      (p < 0.001) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) (p = 0.01) significantly affected 
      apixaban AUC0−6h. P-gp activity (p < 0.001) also significantly impacted 
      rivaroxaban AUC0−6h. The phenotypic switch (from normal to poor metabolizer) of 
      P-gp led to an increase of apixaban and rivaroxaban AUC0−6h by 16% and 25%, 
      respectively, equivalent to a decrease of 38 mL/min in CrCl according to the 
      apixaban model. CYP3A phenotype and tested SNPs of CYP3A/P-gp had no significant 
      impact. In conclusion, P-gp phenotypic activity, rather than known CYP3A/P-gp 
      polymorphisms, could be relevant for dose adjustment.

AB  - PURPOSE: Polypharmacy is a frequent situation in older adults that increases the 
      risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs), both pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
      pharmacodynamic (PD). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are frequently 
      prescribed in older adults, mainly because of the high prevalence of atrial 
      fibrillation (AF). DOACs are subject to cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)- and/or 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated PK DDIs and PD DDIs when co-administered with 
      drugs that interfere with platelet function. The aim of our study was to assess 
      the prevalence of DDIs involving DOACs in older adults and the associated risk 
      factors at admission and discharge. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study 
      conducted in an acute geriatric unit between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 
      2022, including patients over 75 years of age treated with DOACs at admission 
      and/or discharge, for whom a comprehensive collection of co-medications was 
      performed. RESULTS: From 909 hospitalizations collected, the prevalence of PK 
      DDIs involving DOACs was 16.9% at admission and 20.7% at discharge, and the 
      prevalence of PD DDIs was 20.7% at admission and 20.2% at discharge. Factors 
      associated with DDIs were bleeding history [adjusted odds ratio (ORa) 1.74, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 1.13-2.68], number of drugs > 6 (ORa 2.54, 95% CI 
      1.88-3.46) and reduced dose of DOACs (ORa 0.39, 95% CI 0.28-0.54) at admission 
      and age > 87 years (ORa 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99), number of drugs > 6 (ORa 2.01, 
      95% CI 1.48-2.72) and reduced dose of DOACs (ORa 0.41, 95% CI 0.30-0.57) at 
      discharge. CONCLUSION: This study provides an indication of the prevalence of 
      DDIs as well as the profile of DDIs and patients treated with DOACs.

TI  - Using Pharmacogenetics of Direct Oral Anticoagulants to Predict Changes in Their 
      Pharmacokinetics and the Risk of Adverse Drug Reactions.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines9050451 [doi]
LID - 451
AB  - Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) that are increasingly used worldwide. Taking into account their 
      widespread use for the prevention of thromboembolism in cardiology, neurology, 
      orthopedics, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) as well as their different 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics dependence, it is critical to explore new 
      opportunities for DOACs administration and predict their dosage when used as 
      monotherapy or in combination with other drugs. In this review, we describe the 
      details of the relative pharmacogenetics on the pharmacokinetics of DOACs as well 
      as new data concerning the clinical characteristics that predetermine the needed 
      dosage and the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The usefulness of genetic 
      information before and shortly after the initiation of DOACs is also discussed. 
      The reasons for particular attention to these issues are not only new genetic 
      knowledge and genotyping possibilities, but also the risk of serious ADRs 
      (primarily, gastrointestinal bleeding). Taking into account the effect of the 
      carriership of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of genes encoding 
      biotransformation enzymes and DOACs metabolism, the use of these measures is 
      important to predict changes in pharmacokinetics and the risk of ADRs in patients 
      with a high risk of thromboembolism who receive anticoagulant therapy.

AB  - Tedizolid (TDZ) is a novel oxazolidinone class antibiotic, indicated for the 
      treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections in adults. In 
      this study a highly sensitive UPLC-MS/MS assay was developed and validated for 
      the determination of TDZ in rat plasma using rivaroxaban as an internal standard 
      (IS). Both TDZ and IS were separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH™ C(18) column using 
      an isocratic mobile phase comprising of acetonitrile-20 mm ammonium acetate 
      (85:15, v/v), eluted at 0.3 mL/min flow rate. The plasma sample was processed by 
      liquid liquid extraction technique using ethyl acetate as an extracting agent. 
      The analyte and IS were detected in positive mode using electrospray ionization 
      source. The precursor to product ion transitions at m/z 371.09 > 343.10 for TDZ 
      and m/z 435.97 > 144.94 for IS were used for the quantification in multiple 
      reaction monitoring mode. The calibration curve was linear in the concentration 
      range of 0.74-1500 ng/mL and the lower limit of quantification was 0.74 ng/mL 
      only. The developed assay was validated following standard guidelines for 
      bioanalytical method validation (US Food and Drug Administration) and all the 
      validation results were within the acceptable limits. The developed assay was 
      successfully applied into a pharmacokinetic study in rats. Copyright © 2016 John

AB  - Rivaroxaban is a new oral direct factor Xa inhibitor recently approved for the 
      treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and for the prevention of stroke in 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Using a modified Delphi method, a group of 
      Italian multidisciplinary specialists (internists, hematologists, angiologists, 
      cardiologists, neurologists) guided by an expert panel reviewed the practical 
      management of these clinical conditions in different healthcare settings and 
      debated the limitations and gaps in clinical studies, national guidelines and the 
      role of rivaroxaban in VTE and nonvalvular AF. This survey, named "EXTRA 
      project", was divided into two arms (EXTRA-VTE, EXTRA-AF) and took place in two 
      phases: the first was based on a questionnaire filled out on-line, and the second 
      was a meeting attended by all the specialists to address the most controversial 
      topics. Almost all of the participants expressed agreement in considering 
      rivaroxaban a new cornerstone of stroke prevention and treatment of VTE. They 
      appreciated its predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, the wide 
      therapeutic window, the lack of relevant interactions with many commonly 
      prescribed co-medications, no requirement for routine coagulation monitoring or 
      dose adjustment, and the good tolerability in a broad spectrum of patients at 
      high risk of complications. The results are here reported and discussed together 
      with the therapeutic contextualization and the future clinical perspectives of 
      rivaroxaban.

PG  - 639-47
LID - 10.1517/14740338.2014.895321 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recently, new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have become available to 
      treat thromboembolic disorders. The efficacy and safety of these agents have been 
      thoroughly tested in various clinical trials. In this article, we discuss the 
      evidence for the safety and efficacy of dabigatran in the prevention and 
      treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). AREAS COVERED: We discuss the 
      pharmacology of dabigatran and compare it to that of warfarin and two of the 
      other popular NOACs, rivaroxaban and apixaban. The indications for and evidence 
      behind dabigatran in the prevention of VTE are presented, as well as the trials 
      examining its potential use for the treatment and extended treatment of VTE. We 
      conclude by considering the safety aspects of the drug. EXPERT OPINION: For most 
      patients the overall net clinical benefit would seem to be in favour of 
      dabigatran. Both efficacy and safety have been proven in the setting of robust 
      randomised controlled trials. 'Real world' registry data as well as long-term 
      trial follow-up will add further critical information. Long-term experience might 
      be one of the few advantages warfarin still has over dabigatran in patients who 
      are eligible for both.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DAO), anti-IIa or anti-Xa, are intended to be widely 
      used for the treatment and prevention of thrombotic disorders in venous 
      thromboembolic disease and atrial fibrillation as an alternative of vitamin K 
      antagonists (VKA). Despite predictable pharmacological properties, spontaneous or 
      provoked hemorrhagic risks by DAO are major limitations. Thus, after few years of 
      inconsistence concerning biological implication and in particular coagulation 
      tests, it is now established that we need biology to evaluate hemorrhagic risk 
      before surgery or in hemorrhagic cases.

TI  - Concerns about the use of new oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in 
      elderly patients with atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 949-58
LID - 10.1007/s40266-013-0119-3 [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and the embolic risk increase with 
      age. Elderly AF patients are undertreated with vitamin K antagonists (VKA). The 
      new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban have been 
      shown to be non-inferior to VKA for stroke prevention in AF. We summarize the 
      knowledge about primary and secondary stroke prevention by NOAC in AF patients 
      >75 years of age. A literature search was carried out using the terms 
      'dabigatran', 'rivaroxaban', 'apixaban', 'elderly', 'octogenarians', 'atrial 
      fibrillation' and 'anticoagulation' from 1998 to 2013. Randomized clinical 
      trials, longitudinal studies, case series and case reports were included. Whereas 
      studies investigating the use of VKA for stroke prevention in the 1990s were 
      carried out by industry-independent institutions, all NOAC-investigating trials 
      were sponsored by the manufacturers of the respective drugs. Frail elderly people 
      were not represented in NOAC-investigating trials because of various exclusion 
      criteria, and only one-third of patients were aged >75 years. A subgroup analysis 
      from the dabigatran-investigating trial indicated that elderly patients might 
      have a higher risk for extracranial bleeding complications with NOAC than with 
      VKA. Further concerns about the use of NOAC in the elderly are the high 
      prevalence of renal insufficiency in AF patients >75 years of age, the largely 
      unknown risk of drug-drug and drug-food interactions, the lack of easily 
      available laboratory monitoring tests of anticoagulant activity and the lack of 
      an antidote. There is a need for independent studies comparing the efficacy and 
      risk of side effects of NOAC with that of VKA in elderly AF patients.

TI  - Optimizing the use of anticoagulants (heparins and oral anticoagulants) in the 
      elderly.
PG  - 687-99
LID - 10.1007/s40266-013-0101-0 [doi]
AB  - As longevity constantly increases, the number of elderly patients (75 years and 
      older) who require anticoagulation likewise rises steadily. Managing elderly 
      patients receiving anticoagulants is challenging because those patients are at 
      high risk of both thrombosis and bleeding. Moreover, older patients are commonly 
      frail: they have substantial chronic co-morbid conditions including renal 
      impairment and frequent acute illnesses and are often polymedicated. There 
      remains a clear need to optimize the use of anticoagulant drugs in these 
      patients, especially at full anticoagulant dose. In the last decade, efforts have 
      been made to better understand the inter-individual variability in the response 
      of elderly patients to traditional anticoagulants including heparin derivatives 
      (unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparins and fondaparinux) and 
      vitamin K antagonists. Moreover, their safety profile has been evaluated in 
      different settings in the elderly, assisting in minimizing risks related to their 
      use. Emergence of new oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban), 
      which appear to be much more convenient, is promising. Even though some elderly 
      patients were included in pivotal clinical trials evaluating these new 
      anticoagulants, the safety of these drugs remains uncertain in real life.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia and it is associated with 
      systemic thromboembolism. Until recently, vitamin K antagonists (VKA) such as 
      warfarin were the only available oral anticoagulant therapy for prevention of 
      stroke and systemic embolism in AF. Limitations of VKA therapy have prompted 
      researchers to search for novel anticoagulant drugs, which do not necessitate 
      coagulation monitoring due to their more predictable pharmacokinetic profile. 
      Large-scale phase III trials have been completed for some of these drugs and 
      'U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)' approved dabigatran and rivaroxaban for 
      prevention of systemic embolism in non-valvular AF patients. In this review, we 
      will first focus on pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of these 
      medications and then try to overview clinical trial results. We will also try to 
      mention the current controversies regarding the clinical application of these 
      drugs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence for the use of the direct-acting oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) in adult patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia 
      (HIT). DATA SOURCE: A PubMed search (1950-February 2015) was collected using the 
      terms heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or 
      apixaban, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and target-specific anticoagulants, 
      or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and direct-acting oral anticoagulants, or 
      heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and new oral anticoagulants. STUDY SELECTION AND 
      DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language articles were reviewed for inclusion. The 
      references of included articles were reviewed for additional data. DATA 
      SYNTHESIS: HIT is an immune-mediated, prothrombotic adverse reaction that 
      requires not only discontinuation of heparin but also initiation of an 
      alternative nonheparin anticoagulant to counter the effects of the autoimmune 
      cascade. Pharmacotherapeutic management with argatroban is unpredictable and 
      problematic. The DOACs display predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      profiles and exhibit no interaction with platelet factor 4. Currently, the DOACs 
      are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for venous thromboembolism, yet 
      have limited evidence in both in vitro and clinical HIT studies. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Though dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban have been used in case reports, 
      currently data are not yet sufficient to recommend clinical use of these agents 
      in the management of HIT. Future trial results may further substantiate 
      management of HIT with use of the DOACs.

AB  - Thromboembolic disease is a major leading cause of mortality and morbidity in 
      industrialized countries. Currently, the management of these patients is 
      challenging due to the availability of new drugs with proven efficacy and 
      security compared to traditional oral vitamin K antagonists. These compounds are 
      characterized by a predictable pharmacokinetic profile for which blood monitoring 
      is not routinely needed. Nevertheless, some data have suggested inter-patient 
      variability in the anticoagulant effect of these drugs, raising concerns about 
      their effectiveness and safety. Although mass-spectrometry is the gold standard 
      to determine drug plasma concentrations, this method is not widely available in 
      every-day practice and some coagulation assays are commonly used to determine the 
      anticoagulant effect of these drugs. The present review aims to summarize the 
      current knowledge regarding the clinical question of how and when to monitor 
      patients with new anticoagulant oral agents.

AB  - The development of novel oral anticoagulants provides clinicians and patients a 
      welcome alternative to the challenges of warfarin therapy. Dermatologists must be 
      aware of the potential impact of novel oral anticoagulants on their surgical and 
      medical practice. This review provides a concise summary of the novel oral 
      anticoagulants for dermatologists with particular emphasis on: (1) the 
      pharmacokinetic properties of these drugs and how they differ from warfarin, (2) 
      suggested management during cutaneous surgery, (3) adverse drug interactions with 
      commonly prescribed medications in dermatology, and (4) potential use within 
      dermatology for treatment of disorders of cutaneous thrombosis.

TI  - Model-based meta-analysis to evaluate optimal doses of direct oral factor Xa 
      inhibitors in atrial fibrillation patients.
PG  - 1066-1075
LID - 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017013805 [doi]
AB  - The noninferiority of direct oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors (rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban) in treatment of atrial fibrillation were demonstrated 
      compared with warfarin by several large clinical trials; however, subsequent 
      meta-analyses reported a higher risk of major bleeding with rivaroxaban than with 
      the other FXa inhibitors. In the present study, we first estimated the changes of 
      prothrombin time (PT) in 5 randomized trials based on reported population 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models and then carried out a model-based 
      meta-analysis to obtain models describing the relationship between PT changes and 
      the event rates of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (SE) and of major bleeding. 
      By using the models, we simulated the optimal therapeutic doses for each FXa 
      inhibitor. It was suggested that dose reduction of rivaroxaban from the current 
      20 mg/d to 10 mg/d would decrease patient deaths from major bleeding (hazard 
      ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.74) with little increase 
      in those for ischemic stroke/SE (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.20). The overall 
      decrease in the mortality caused by both events was estimated as 5.81 per 10 000 
      patient-years (95% CI, 3.92-8.16), with an HR of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91). For 
      apixaban and edoxaban, no distinct change in the overall mortality was simulated 
      by dose modification. This study suggested that the current dose of rivaroxaban 
      might be excessive and would need to be reduced to decrease the excess risk of 
      major bleeding.

TI  - Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Obesity: An Updated Literature Review.
PG  - 1144-1158
LID - 10.1177/1060028020923584 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review literature on the use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) in patients with high body weight (BW) and/or high body mass index (BMI) 
      and to make recommendations regarding use in this patient population. DATA 
      SOURCES: A search using PubMed was conducted (inception to April 13, 2020) using 
      the term DOAC AND the terms obesity OR body weight. A separate search was also 
      conducted with individual DOACs (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) and 
      the aforementioned terms. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies included 
      examined the effect of BW and/or BMI on DOAC pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or 
      safety. Included studies had DOAC indications of prevention of stroke in 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, or treatment or long-term prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism. DATA SYNTHESIS: The efficacy and safety of DOACs in patients 
      with high BW/BMI has not yet been elucidated by randomized trials; however, 2016 
      international guidelines suggest avoiding their use in patients with a BW >120 kg 
      or BMI >40 kg/m(2). Since 2016, several studies have been published examining use 
      of DOACs in this patient population. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: This review thoroughly discusses the literature on DOACs in patients 
      with a BW >120 kg or BMI >40 kg/m(2) pre-2016 and post-2016 guidelines. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Evidence indicates that each DOAC may have differences in outcomes 
      when used in patients with a high BW/BMI. Currently, low-quality data are 
      available that support avoiding dabigatran and considering apixaban or 
      rivaroxaban; lack of sufficient data preclude a recommendation for edoxaban use 
      in this patient population.

TI  - Risk Factors for Rivaroxaban-Related Bleeding Events-Possible Role of 
      Pharmacogenetics: Case Series.
LID - 10.3390/pharmacy11010029 [doi]
LID - 29
AB  - Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants' interindividual trough 
      concentration variability affects efficacy and safety, especially in bleeding 
      events. Rivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4/5-, CYP2J2-, and CYP-independent 
      mechanisms and is a substrate of two transporter proteins: ABCB1 (MDR1, 
      P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 (BCRP; breast-cancer-resistance protein). The 
      polymorphisms of these genes may possibly affect the pharmacokinetics of 
      rivaroxaban and, consequently, its safety profile. Rivaroxaban variability may be 
      associated with age, liver and kidney function, concomitant illness and therapy, 
      and pharmacogenetic predisposition. This case series is the first, to our 
      knowledge, that presents multiple risk factors for rivaroxaban-related bleeding 
      (RRB) including age, renal function, concomitant diseases, concomitant treatment, 
      and pharmacogenetic data. It presents patients with RRB, along with their 
      complete clinical and pharmacogenetic data, as well as an evaluation of possible 
      risk factors for RRB. Thirteen patients were carriers of ABCB1, ABCG2, CYP2J2, 
      and/or CYP3A4/5 gene polymorphisms. Possible drug-drug interactions with 
      increased bleeding risk were identified in nine patients. Six patients had eGFR 
      <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Our data suggest a possible role of multiple factors and 
      their interactions in predicting RRB; however, they also indicate the need for 
      further comprehensive multidisciplinary research to enable safer use of this 
      product based on a personalised approach.

AB  - Patients who do not sufficiently adhere to their dosing regimens will, 
      ultimately, do not get the full benefit of their medication. For example, if 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are not taken continuously, an intervention to 
      improve adherence or maintain persistence will show direct effects on clinical 
      outcomes. Usually, adherent patients are defined by taking ≥80% of their 
      medication. The resulting binary adherence status from this threshold can as well 
      be used for predictive classification. Thus, the threshold can determine the 
      prediction model's performance to identify patients at risk for poor adherence by 
      this binary adherence status. In this perspective, we propose a plan for model 
      development and performance considering the threshold's role. Concerning 
      development demands, we extracted predictors from a systematic literature search 
      on DOAC adherence to be used as a core set of candidate predictors. 
      Independently, we investigated how well a future model would technically have to 
      perform by modeling drug intake and thromboembolic events based on a rivaroxaban 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. Using this simulation framework for 
      different thresholds, we projected the impact of an imperfectly predicted 
      adherence status on the event risk, and how imperfect sensitivity and specificity 
      affect the cost balance if a supporting intervention was offered to patients 
      classified as non-adherent. Our simulation results suggest applying a rather high 
      threshold (90%) for discrimination between patients at low or high risk for 
      non-adherence by a prediction model in order to assure cost-efficient 
      implementation.

TI  - Prophylaxis of thromboembolic events in patients with nephrotic syndrome.
PG  - 725-34
LID - 10.1345/aph.1R530 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review published literature regarding use of strategies to prevent 
      thrombotic events in patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS). DATA SOURCES: The 
      MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were queried from 1980 to December 
      2012 for articles in English using the search terms nephrotic syndrome, 
      thrombosis, thromboembolism, anticoagulation, warfarin, heparin, 
      low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin, statin, 
      atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, 
      simvastatin, aspirin, direct thrombin inhibitor, rivaroxaban, argatroban, 
      lepirudin, bivalirudin, dabigatran, factor Xa inhibitor, fondaparinux, 
      rivaroxaban, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and prasugrel. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA 
      EXTRACTION: All relevant original studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, 
      guidelines, and review articles were assessed for inclusion. References from 
      pertinent articles were examined for additional content not found during the 
      initial search. DATA SYNTHESIS: NS leads to multiple complications, including 
      hypercoagulability. A small prospective cohort study used enoxaparin for primary 
      prophylaxis and demonstrated successful prevention of thrombotic events with 
      minimal adverse events. Additional information has come in the form of decision 
      analyses, which show potential decreased morbidity and mortality when primary 
      prophylaxis for thrombotic events is used; however, all data have numerous 
      limitations. Other strategies for thrombus prevention, including statins and 
      antiplatelet agents, also have been investigated. CONCLUSIONS: When patients with 
      NS are admitted to the hospital, develop an acute medical illness, or acquire an 
      additional thrombotic events risk factor such as surgery, active malignancy, or 
      pregnancy, consideration for primary pharmacologic prophylaxis with appropriately 
      dosed low-molecular-weight heparin or other indicated anticoagulant should 
      include the potential for increased thrombotic events risk in this patient 
      population. Consideration may also be given to the use of primary pharmacologic 
      prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin or oral vitamin K antagonist in 
      patients with membranous nephropathy once the albumin level drops below 2.0-2.5 
      g/dL. Short-term use of pharmacologic prophylaxis during the first 6 months 
      following diagnosis warrants further investigation.

TI  - New oral anti-coagulants: Implications for neurosurgery.
PG  - 182-8
LID - 10.3109/02688697.2014.997667 [doi]
AB  - New oral anti-coagulants such as the direct thrombin inhibitor, Dabigatran, and 
      the activated factor X inhibitors, Rivaroxaban and Apixaban, are rapidly gaining 
      clinical popularity in North America and Europe following a number of seminal 
      randomised control trials comparing their efficacy to Warfarin and Enoxaparin. In 
      the coming years these agents are set to replace Warfarin use for the primary 
      prevention of stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, post-operative 
      thromboprophylaxis and the treatment of deep vein thrombosis. The main trials 
      have shown superior anti-coagulant effects over warfarin and low-molecular-weight 
      heparin with the added benefits of lower bleeding complications (including 
      intracranial haemorrhages) and no requirement for monitoring. Case reports are 
      now appearing in the literature, highlighting some of the complications of their 
      use, namely the lack of a uniform normalised anti-coagulation test and the 
      paucity in clinical experience with reversing the anti-coagulant effects when 
      emergent surgery is mandated. This review has been written for the neurosurgeon 
      who will shortly be confronted with increasing numbers of patients taking new 
      oral anti-coagulants and intracranial complications. Hospital clinicians will 
      need to understand the pharmacokinetics of drug administration, the laboratory 
      tests to measure the level of anti-coagulation and the treatment of patients who 
      are therapeutically anti-coagulated and require urgent surgical intervention.

TI  - Utilization of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in People Living with Human 
      Immunodeficiency Virus: Observational Data from the District of Columbia Cohort.
PG  - e604-e613
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become first-line treatment 
      for venous thrombotic events. DOAC prescribing trends among people living with 
      human immunodeficiency virus (PWH) are not well described. The coadministration 
      of DOACs with the antiretroviral (ARV) pharmacokinetic boosters ritonavir (RTV) 
      or cobicistat (COBI) may be complicated by pharmacokinetic interactions. METHODS: 
      A longitudinal cohort study was conducted using the D.C. Cohort Database in 
      Washington, D.C., from January 2011 to March 2017, to describe oral anticoagulant 
      prescribing among PWH ≥ 18 years old and the prevalence of DOAC use with RTV or 
      COBI. Data collection included demographic and clinical characteristics, ARV and 
      anticoagulant prescriptions, and International Classification of Diseases Ninth 
      and Tenth Edition diagnosis codes. RESULTS: Among 8315 PWH, there were 236 
      anticoagulant prescriptions (96 DOAC, 140 warfarin) for 206 persons. PWH 
      prescribed anticoagulants were predominantly Black (82%) and male (82%), with a 
      mean age at anticoagulant initiation of 56 years. DOAC use increased from 3% of 
      total anticoagulant prescribing in 2011 to 43% in 2016, accounting for 64% of all 
      newly recorded anticoagulant prescriptions by 2016. There were 19 bleeding events 
      recorded among 16 individuals. Despite the Food and Drug Administration label 
      recommendation to avoid rivaroxaban with boosted ARVs, 41% remained on boosted 
      ARVs after rivaroxaban initiation. CONCLUSIONS: DOAC use increased substantially 
      in PWH by 2016. Although rivaroxaban is not recommended with RTV or COBI, 
      concomitant use was recorded in 41% of rivaroxaban recipients in this cohort. As 
      DOAC usage increases, clinicians need to be aware of potential DOAC/ARV 
      interactions in order to select the most appropriate oral anticoagulant and 
      monitoring plan for PWH.

TI  - Impact of bariatric surgery on oral anticoagulants pharmacology, and consequences 
      for clinical practice: a narrative review.
PG  - 53-61
LID - 10.1111/fcp.12587 [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of obesity has been steadily increasing in recent years worldwide. 
      At the same time bariatric surgery, the best therapeutic strategy to date in 
      terms of sustainable weight loss and improvement of associated comorbidities has 
      been also increasing. However, these surgeries, whether primarily restrictive or 
      malabsorptive, raise questions about the pharmacology of oral drugs. Among widely 
      used drugs, anticoagulants are the referent therapy to treat some cardiovascular 
      diseases such as atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. How bariatric 
      surgery may impact pharmacological properties of oral anticoagulants, and more 
      specifically, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are difficult to anticipate. In 
      this review, we describe available data concerning the potential impact of 
      bariatric surgery on the pharmacology of oral anticoagulants. The vitamin K 
      antagonists (VKAs) requirements for the same international normalized ratio 
      target are reduced after bariatric surgery. Limited data available for dabigatran 
      150 mg twice daily indicate a risk of insufficient efficacy in atrial 
      fibrillation after gastric bypass due to probable impaired absorption. Data for 
      rivaroxaban at the prophylactic dose of 10 mg per day suggest no impact of 
      bariatric surgery from 3 days to 8 months post-surgery. However, no conclusive 
      data are available for other anticoagulants or the use of DOACs at therapeutic 
      doses. To date, DOACs are not recommended in patients who have undergone 
      bariatric surgery, because of limited available data. Pending new studies to 
      confirm the predictable pharmacokinetics and safety of DOACs in this population, 
      especially at therapeutic doses, VKAs remain the first option for chronic 
      anticoagulation.

TI  - Evaluation of Drug-Drug Interactions Between Clarithromycin and Direct Oral 
      Anticoagulants Using Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Models.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics16111449 [doi]
LID - 1449
AB  - Objective: This study assessed the pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between 
      clarithromycin (a P-glycoprotein [P-gp] inhibitor) and four direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) (P-gp substrates) using physiologically based PK (PBPK) 
      models to elucidate the influence of P-gp in the interaction between them. 
      Methods: PBPK models for clarithromycin, DABE-dabigatran (DAB), rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban were constructed using GastroPlus™ (version 9.9), based on 
      physicochemical data and PK parameters from the literature. The models were 
      optimized and validated in healthy subjects. We evaluated the predictive 
      performance of the established model and further assessed the impact of P-gp on 
      the PK of the four DOACs. Successfully validated models were then used to 
      evaluate potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between clarithromycin and the 
      DOACs. Results: The established PBPK models accurately described the PK of 
      clarithromycin, DABE-DAB, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. The predicted PK 
      parameters (C(max), T(max), AUC(0-t)) were within 0.5-2 times the observed 
      values. A sensitivity analysis of P-gp parameters indicated that an increase in 
      P-gp expression was reduced by in vivo exposure to DOACs. The models demonstrated 
      good predictive ability for DDIs between clarithromycin and the anticoagulants, 
      and the ratio of the predicted values to the observed values of C(max) and the 
      area under the curve (AUC) in the DDI state was within the range of 0.5-2. 
      Conclusions: Comprehensive PBPK models for clarithromycin, DABE-DAB, rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban were developed, which can effectively predict DDIs 
      mediated by P-gp's function. These models provide theoretical support for 
      clinical dose adjustments and serve as a foundation for future PBPK model 
      development for DOACs under specific pathological conditions.

AB  - Warfarin has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for medical 
      use as an anticoagulant for more than 60 years. Although it has been an effective 
      anticoagulant, its use is accompanied by several pitfalls, which has led to 
      research and the discovery of new additional groups of anticoagulants: direct 
      thrombin inhibitors, such as dabigatran, and direct factor Xa inhibitors, such as 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban. These new anticoagulants are fast-acting, noninferior 
      to warfarin in preventing stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation, and do not require monitoring. More data are accumulating to 
      support their use in the prevention and management of venous thromboembolism. 
      This article reviews the literature on these novel anticoagulants, including 
      their pharmacokinetics and treatment indications.

TI  - The effects of vitamin K supplementation and vitamin K antagonists on progression 
      of vascular calcification: ongoing randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 273-9
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfv146 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The extent and the progression of vascular calcification (VC) are 
      independent predictors of cardiovascular risk in the haemodialysis population. 
      Vitamin K is essential for the activation of matrix gla protein (MGP), a powerful 
      inhibitor of tissue calcification. Functional vitamin K deficiency may contribute 
      to the high VC burden in haemodialysis patients. In addition, haemodialysis 
      patients are frequently treated with vitamin K antagonists, mainly to prevent 
      stroke in atrial fibrillation, potentially compounding the cardiovascular risk in 
      these already vulnerable patients. New oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are valuable 
      alternatives to vitamin K antagonists in the general population, but their use in 
      dialysis has been encumbered by substantial renal clearance. However, a recent 
      pharmacokinetic study provided information on how to use rivaroxaban in 
      haemodialysis patients. METHODS: We conduct a randomized, prospective, 
      multicentre, open-label interventional clinical trial that will include 117 
      chronic haemodialysis patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, treated 
      with or candidates for treatment with vitamin K antagonists. Patients will be 
      randomized to a vitamin K antagonist titrated weekly to an international 
      normalized ratio between 2 and 3, a daily dose of rivaroxaban of 10 mg, or a 
      daily dose of rivaroxaban 10 mg with a thrice weekly supplement of 2000 µg 
      vitamin K2. Cardiac computed tomography, pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements 
      and MGP sampling will be performed at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 18 
      months. Primary endpoints include progression of coronary artery and thoracic 
      aorta calcification and changes in PWV. Secondary endpoints are progression of 
      aortic and mitral valve calcification, all-cause mortality, major adverse 
      cardiovascular events, stroke and bleeding. The ClinicalTrials.gov database was 
      searched to retrieve related trials. RESULTS: Seven trials, three of which are 
      performed in the haemodialysis population, evaluate whether pharmacological doses 
      of vitamin K1 or K2 retard progression of VC. Five studies compare the effect of 
      warfarin and NOACs on progression of VC, the present study being the only 
      conducted in the dialysis population. CONCLUSION: Vitamin K deficiency may be a 
      modifiable cardiovascular risk factor in the haemodialysis population. 
      Conversely, vitamin K antagonists may aggravate VC burden in haemodialysis 
      patients. Several ongoing trials may provide an answer to these questions in the 
      near future.

TI  - Establishing Edoxaban's Role in Anticoagulation.
PG  - 228-38
LID - 10.1177/0897190016647314 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This article serves as a review of the current literature regarding the 
      role of edoxaban for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) and the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). SUMMARY: 
      Until recent years, oral treatment options for both treatment and prevention of 
      VTE and stroke were limited to warfarin. Dabigatran was the first new oral 
      anticoagulant approved in over 50 years followed by rivaroxaban and apixaban. 
      These new oral anticoagulants offer many benefits over warfarin. Edoxaban is the 
      newest member among the oral anticoagulants and exerts its action by direct 
      inhibition of factor Xa. It may offer some advantages in that it is the second 
      Food and Drug Administration-approved once-daily anticoagulant available and does 
      not interact with the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system. However, there are 
      concerns in patients with AF and preserved renal function (>95 mL/min), as these 
      cohorts experienced a higher incidence of stroke in trials. CONCLUSION: Based on 
      the 3 clinical trials, edoxaban appears to be a safe and effective factor Xa 
      inhibitor in patients with a creatinine clearance of <95 mL/min. It will serve as 
      an alternative anticoagulant for those with a preference for once-daily dosing 
      and/or taking medications that interact with the CYP450 system.

TI  - Dental management of patients taking novel oral anticoagulants (NOAs): 
      Dabigatran.
PG  - e289-e293
LID - 10.4317/jced.53219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A new group of oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban 
      and edoxaban) with clear advantages over classic dicoumarin oral anticoagulants 
      (warfarin and acenocoumarol) has been developed in recent years. Patients being 
      treated with oral anticoagulants are at higher risk for bleeding when undergoing 
      dental treatments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted 
      through April 2016 for publications in the ISI Web of Knowledge, PubMed and 
      Cochrane Library using the keywords "dabigatran", "rivaroxaban", "apixaban", 
      "edoxaban", "new oral anticoagulants", "novel oral anticoagulants", "bleeding" 
      and "dental treatment". RESULTS: There is no need for regular coagulation 
      monitoring of patients on dabigatran therapy. Whether or not to temporarily 
      discontinue dabigatran must be assessed according to the bleeding risk involved 
      in the dental procedure to be performed. CONCLUSIONS: The number of patients 
      under treatment with new oral anticoagulants will increase in the coming years. 
      It is essential to know about the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of new 
      oral anticoagulants and about their interactions with other drugs. It is 
      necessary to develop clinical guidelines for the perioperative and postoperative 
      management of these new oral anticoagulants in oral surgical procedures, and to 
      carefully evaluate the bleeding risk of dental treatment, as well as the 
      thrombotic risk of suppressing the new oral anticoagulant. Key words:Dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, novel oral anticoagulants, bleeding.

TI  - Current Antithrombotic Therapy Strategies in Children with a Focus on Off-Label 
      Direct Oral Anticoagulants-A Narrative Review.
LID - 10.3390/children9071093 [doi]
LID - 1093
AB  - (1) Background: The incidence of thromboembolic events is relatively low in the 
      general population, but it increases in hospitalized children and those who 
      underwent thrombogenic procedures. Although the evidence regarding direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) in children with venous thromboembolism (VTE) is growing, 
      DOACs were excluded from existing guidelines due to the lack of reliable data at 
      that moment. Therefore, current evidence on VTE management in children needs to 
      be critically reviewed. (2) Methods: We have conducted a literature search in the 
      Scopus, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases using prespecified keywords to retrieve 
      studies published between 2010 and 2022. (3) Results: Clinical trials highlighted 
      that rivaroxaban and dabigatran had predictable pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic profiles in children, similar to those observed in adults. 
      Dabigatran and rivaroxaban had a similar safety profile to standard therapy but 
      improved thrombotic burden and resolution during follow-up. Most studies 
      involving apixaban and edoxaban are ongoing, and results are awaited. (4) 
      Conclusions: Dabigatran and rivaroxaban could be valid therapeutic options for 
      VTE management in children. In the case of apixaban and edoxaban, results from 
      ongoing clinical studies are required before using them in pediatric VTE.

TI  - Managing patients taking edoxaban in dentistry.
PG  - e308-e311
LID - 10.4317/jced.53431 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anticoagulation therapy is used in several conditions to prevent or 
      treat thromboembolism. A new group of oral anticoagulants with clear advantages 
      over classic dicoumarin oral anticoagulants (warfarin and acenocoumarol) has been 
      developed in recent years. The Food and Drug Administration has approved 
      edoxaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban. Their advantages include: 
      predictable pharmacokinetics, drug interactions and limited food, rapid onset of 
      action and short half-life. However, they lack a specific reversal agent. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: This paper examines the available evidence regarding 
      rivaroxaban and sets out proposals for clinical guidance of dental practitioners 
      treating these patients in primary dental care. A literature search was conducted 
      through July 2016 for publications in PubMed and Cochrane Library using the 
      keywords "edoxaban", "dabigatran", "rivaroxaban", "apixaban", "new oral 
      anticoagulants", "novel oral anticoagulants", "bleeding" and "dental treatment" 
      with the "and" boolean operator in the last 10 years. RESULTS: The number of 
      patients taking edoxaban is increasing. There is no need for regular coagulation 
      monitoring of patients on edoxaban therapy. For patients requiring minor oral 
      surgery procedures, interruption of edoxaban is not generally necessary. 
      Management of patients on anticoagulation therapy requires that dentists can 
      accurately assess the patient prior to dental treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Their 
      increased use means that oral care clinicians should have a sound understanding 
      of the mechanism of action, pharmacology, reversal strategies and management of 
      bleeding in patients taking edoxaban. There is a need for further clinical 
      studies in order to establish more evidence-based guidelines for dental patients 
      requiring edoxaban. Key words:Edoxaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, novel 
      oral anticoagulants, bleeding.

AB  - For many years, vitamin K antagonists, unfractionated heparins, 
      low-molecular-weight heparins and a pentasaccharide were the only anticoagulant 
      drugs available for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after surgery. 
      However, their benefits were associated with disadvantages, such as their 
      subcutaneous route of administration or the need for coagulation monitoring. 
      Research was challenged to develop new drugs that would simplify 
      thromboprophylaxis while showing equivalent or better efficacy. Rivaroxaban and 
      dabigatran are now available in some countries for the prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism after total hip or knee replacement in adults. Apixaban is also 
      undergoing trials for this indication. Additionally, these drugs show potential 
      for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, treatment of venous thromboembolism 
      and prevention of secondary events in acute coronary syndrome.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Genetic data on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban 
      and identification of factors that affect its biotransformation, distribution, 
      and excretion will allow for generation of algorithms for personalized use of 
      this drug in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Here we tested the effects 
      of ABCB1 (ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1) polymorphisms on the valley 
      rivaroxaban blood concentration and on the frequency of hemorrhagic events in 
      patients with AF and propose a personal anticoagulation therapy management 
      protocol. Patients and Methods: This is a retrospective study. We enrolled 
      Mongolian descent patients who met the criteria from May 2018 to August 2019 in 
      Beijing and Fujian. Clinical data on gender, height, weight, liver and kidney 
      functions, drug trough concentration, and drug dosage were collected; we recorded 
      the bleeding events until 6 months after initiating the medication. ABCB1 single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms including rs1128503, rs1045642, and rs4148738 were 
      identified. After reaching the steady state of plasma concentration, the 
      peripheral blood was collected to detect the trough rivaroxaban plasma 
      concentrations before the next medication. Results: We included 155 patients in 
      this study including 81 men and 74 women, with an average age of 71.98 ± 
      10.72 years. The distribution of ABCB1 genotypes conformed to the Hardy-Weinberg 
      equilibrium. Multiple comparisons between wild (TT) and mutant (CT and CC) 
      genotypes at the rs1045642 locus showed no significant differences of rivaroxaban 
      trough concentrations (TT vs. CT, p = 0.586; TT vs. CC, p = 0.802; and CT vs. CC, 
      p = 0.702). Multiple comparison between wild (TT) and mutant (CC) genotypes at 
      the rs1128503 locus revealed a significant difference of rivaroxaban trough 
      concentrations (TT vs. CC, p = 0.0421). But wild (TT) vs mutant (CT) genotypes 
      and mutant CT vs mutant CC genotypes at the rs1128503 locus showed no significant 
      differences of rivaroxaban trough concentrations (TT vs. CT, p = 0.0651; TT vs. 
      CT, p = 0.6127). Multiple comparisons between wild (GG) and mutant (AG and AA) 
      genotypes at the rs4148738 locus showed no significant differences of rivaroxaban 
      trough concentrations (GG vs. AG, p = 0.341; GG vs. AA, p = 0.612; AG vs. AA, p = 
      0.649). There was no significant correlation between ABCB1 gene variation loci 
      rs1045642, rs1128503, rs4148738 and bleeding events. Conclusion: rs1128503 locus 
      variations are correlated with the serum concentration of rivaroxaban in patients 
      of Mongolian descent. But no significant correlation between rs1128503 locus 
      variations and bleeding events were obtained.

AB  - A sensitive and selective ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to 
      tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was developed for the fast, 
      simultaneous quantification of three novel cardiac drugs (aliskiren, prasugrel 
      and rivaroxaban) in human urine. Sample preparation was performed with 
      microextraction with packed sorbent (MEPS), which is a miniaturization of solid 
      phase extraction. The optimal conditions for MEPS extraction were obtained using 
      C8 sorbent, small sample volumes and a short time period (about 3min for the 
      entire sample preparation step). Chromatographic separation of the selected 
      compounds was achieved in less than 1.5min on a Zorbax Rapid Resolution High 
      Definition SB-C18 column using isocratic elution with 0.1% formic acid and 
      acetonitrile (70:30, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.8mLmin(-1). The detection was 
      performed on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer by multiple reaction 
      monitoring via an electrospray ionization source with positive ionization mode. 
      The method was fully validated according to the latest recommendations of 
      international guidelines. The lower limit of quantification was 5.0pgmL(-1) for 
      aliskiren and rivaroxaban and 0.5pgmL(-1) for prasugrel. The intra- and inter-day 
      precision was within 7.12% and the accuracy ranged from -7.54% to 4.17%. The mean 
      extraction recoveries of the MEPSC8 methodology were found to be 98.3% for 
      aliskiren, 100.3% for rivaroxaban and 99.9% for prasugrel. This 
      MEPSC8-UHPLC-MS/MS method offers a fast, simple and precise way to determine 
      selected novel cardiac drugs in human urine that could be applied to therapeutic 
      drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - Investigational treatments of venous thromboembolism.
PG  - 431-40
AB  - The antithrombotic management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) has gone through 
      major developments. Indirect inhibitors such as low molecular weight heparin and 
      the pentasaccharide fondaparinux represent improvements over traditional drugs 
      such as unfractionated heparin for acute treatment of VTE with more targeted 
      approaches, predictable pharmacokinetic profiles and lack of need for monitoring. 
      Vitamin K antagonists, with inherent limitations of multiple food and drug 
      interactions and frequent need for monitoring, remain the only oral 
      anticoagulants approved for long-term secondary thromboprophylaxis in VTE with 
      the removal of the oral direct thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran from the world 
      market due to safety concerns. Newer anticoagulant drugs such as parenteral 
      pentasaccharides (idraparinux and SSR-126517-E), oral direct thrombin inhibitors 
      (dabigatran), oral direct Factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, YM-150 and 
      DU-176b) and tissue factor-Factor VIIa complex inhibitors (NAPc2) are tailor-made 
      to target specific procoagulant complexes and have the potential to greatly 
      expand our antithrombotic armamentarium for both acute and long-term treatment of 
      VTE, especially as non-monitored parenteral and oral anticoagulants with a wide 
      therapeutic window and a predictable anticoagulant response.

TI  - Ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted antiretroviral therapy and direct oral 
      anticoagulants: A case for apixaban.
PG  - 718-722
LID - 10.1177/0956462419832099 [doi]
AB  - The potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between direct oral 
      anticoagulants and antiretroviral therapy (ART) is vast. Ritonavir and cobicistat 
      are used as pharmacokinetic enhancers with either concurrent protease inhibitors 
      or the integrase strand transfer inhibitor, elvitegravir, to optimize therapeutic 
      concentrations by cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition. To date, only rivaroxaban and 
      dabigatran have reported cases of use with ritonavir-boosted ART. Apixaban is 
      metabolized similarly to rivaroxaban, but offers a dose reduction in the case of 
      major DDIs. We report the successful use of reduced-dose apixaban to treat and 
      prevent thromboembolic complications in six persons living with human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted ART. This case 
      series and available literature support the use of apixaban or dabigatran, 
      depending on the boosted ART regimen.

      recommendation from the Subcommittee on Control of Anticoagulation of the 
      Scientific and Standardisation Committee of the International Society on 
      Thrombosis and Haemostasis.
LID - 10.1111/jth.12149 [doi]
AB  - Oral direct inhibitors (ODIs) of thrombin and factor Xa are now approved as 
      anticoagulant drugs. The first two drugs to complete phase III clinical trials 
      for thromboprophylaxis in orthopaedic surgery and treatment of patients with 
      atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism were dabigatran and rivaroxaban. 
      These small molecules are given at fixed dose with no requirement for monitoring 
      as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses are reliably predicted in 
      patients with adequate renal function who are not taking other interacting drugs. 
      However, there will be clinical circumstances in specific patients when 
      measurement of the anticoagulant effect of an ODI will be required. © 2013

TI  - Combination of a new oral anticoagulant, aspirin and clopidogrel after acute 
      coronary syndrome: new therapeutic standard?
PG  - 673-80
LID - 10.1007/s11739-013-1008-9 [doi]
AB  - Effective secondary prevention after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is largely 
      dependent on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Despite DAPT, however, patients 
      remain at substantial risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (i.e., 
      cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke), and, therefore, combination 
      therapy of oral anticoagulant and antiplatelets has been previously proposed. 
      Because of the increase in bleeding and the cumbersome management of vitamin K 
      antagonists, such combination therapy has never gained much popularity. The 
      recent development of new, non vitamin K antagonists, direct oral anticoagulants 
      (NOACs), including dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and darexaban, which have 
      more favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as higher safety, 
      has renewed the interest on combination therapy. Whereas phase II trials with 
      dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and darexaban have consistently shown an 
      increased bleeding risk with combination therapy, a potential increased efficacy 
      has emerged for apixaban and rivaroxaban, thereby prompting phase III studies. 
      Both APPRAISE-2 and ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI 51 trials confirm a dose-dependent increase 
      in major bleeding events, including intracranial, with apixaban and rivaroxaban 
      when combined with DAPT. Low-dose (2.5 mg twice daily) rivaroxaban on the other 
      hand, is associated with a significantly higher efficacy on the occurrence of 
      combined cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and of stent 
      thrombosis. Owing to the persistent uncertainty regarding the net clinical 
      benefit of combined therapy of NOAC, namely low-dose (2.5 mg twice daily) 
      rivaroxaban and DAPT of aspirin and clopidogrel, further studies are warranted to 
      identify the ACS patient who will benefit most from such treatment, also in 
      comparison to the current therapeutic standard represented by DAPT of aspirin and 
      ticagrelor (or prasugrel).

PG  - 1192-207

AB  - Warfarin is the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant. However, it remains 
      a difficult drug to manage mostly because of its narrow therapeutic index and 
      wide interpatient variability in anticoagulant effects. Over the past decade, 
      there has been substantial progress in our understanding of genetic contributions 
      to variable warfarin response, particularly with regard to warfarin dose 
      requirements. The genes encoding for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 (CYP2C9) and 
      vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) are the major genetic 
      determinants of warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, respectively. 
      Numerous studies have demonstrated significant contributions of these genes to 
      warfarin dose requirements. The CYP2C9 gene has also been associated with 
      bleeding risk with warfarin. The CYP4F2 gene influences vitamin K availability 
      and makes minor contributions to warfarin dose requirements. Less is known about 
      genes influencing warfarin response in African-American patients compared with 
      other racial groups, but this is the focus of ongoing research. Several warfarin 
      pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms and United States Food and Drug 
      Administration-cleared genotyping tests are available for clinical use. Clinical 
      trials are ongoing to determine the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of 
      genotypeguided warfarin dosing. Results from these trials will likely influence 
      clinical uptake and third party payer reimbursement for genotype-guided warfarin 
      therapy. There is still a lack of pharmacogenetic data for the newly approved 
      oral anticoagulants, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, and with other oral 
      anticoagulants in the research and development pipeline. These data, once known, 
      could be of great importance as routine monitoring parameters for these agents 
      are not available.

TI  - The current landscape of treatment options for venous thromboembolism: a focus on 
      novel oral anticoagulants.
PG  - 197-210
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2014.975786 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 
      and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and 
      healthcare expenditure. Anticoagulant therapy is recommended for at least 3 
      months in patients with acute VTE to prevent recurrence. Conventional 
      anticoagulants are associated with inherent limitations including route of 
      administration, required monitoring and dose adjustments, potential for food-drug 
      and drug-drug interactions, unpredictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, 
      and possible severe adverse events. SCOPE: This manuscript reviews the 
      pharmacology of the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), and analyzes the 
      differences in phase 3 clinical trial designs, outcomes, and specific patient 
      populations investigated for the treatment of acute and prevention of secondary 
      VTE. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed using the key words 
      dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and venous thromboembolism in 
      PubMed. The search included all years, English language, and peer-reviewed 
      articles relating to phase 3 clinical trials, subanalyses, and meta-analyses of 
      these NOACs for the treatment of acute VTE and secondary prevention. FINDINGS: 
      NOACs have demonstrated comparable efficacy and comparable or superior safety in 
      large, randomized clinical trials in the treatment and prevention of VTE compared 
      with conventional therapy. New oral anticoagulants, including the direct thrombin 
      (dabigatran etexilate) and direct factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      and edoxaban), have advantages over conventional agents such as oral 
      administration at fixed doses, predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, 
      minimal potential for food-drug and drug-drug interactions, and lack of required 
      monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: NOACs offer additional oral anticoagulation treatment 
      options for patients with VTE.

AB  - Effective venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized medically-ill 
      patients and those undergoing orthopaedic surgery remains a challenge for 
      clinicians in the United States. Several new oral anticoagulants, which either 
      directly inhibit the activity of thrombin or factor Xa have been developed and 
      studied for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention in phase III trials in these 
      patient populations. These new medications demonstrate several advantages over 
      traditional anticoagulants, including their administration at fixed doses with no 
      requirement for routine coagulation monitoring. Such advantages may potentially 
      be offset by the lack of well-studied methods to reverse their anticoagulant 
      effects and the potential need for standardized testing to monitor their activity 
      in certain situations. This review will provide an overview of the clinical trial 
      results of dabigatran, apixaban and rivaroxaban for VTE prevention in the 
      orthopaedic and medically-ill hospitalized patients.

TI  - Rivaroxaban for stroke patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (RISAPS): protocol 
      for a randomized controlled, phase IIb proof-of-principle trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal secondary prevention antithrombotic therapy for patients with 
      antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)-associated ischemic stroke, transient ischemic 
      attack, or other ischemic brain injury is undefined. The standard of care, 
      warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists at standard or high intensity 
      (international normalized ratio (INR) target range 2.0-3.0/3.0-4.0, 
      respectively), has well-recognized limitations. Direct oral anticoagulants have 
      several advantages over warfarin, and the potential role of high-dose direct oral 
      anticoagulants vs high-intensity warfarin in this setting merits investigation. 
      OBJECTIVES: The Rivaroxaban for Stroke patients with APS trial (RISAPS) seeks to 
      determine whether high-dose rivaroxaban could represent a safe and effective 
      alternative to high-intensity warfarin in adult patients with APS and previous 
      ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or other ischemic brain 
      manifestations. METHODS: This phase IIb prospective, randomized, controlled, 
      noninferiority, open-label, proof-of-principle trial compares rivaroxaban 15 mg 
      twice daily vs warfarin, target INR range 3.0-4.0. The sample size target is 40 
      participants. Triple antiphospholipid antibody-positive patients are excluded. 
      The primary efficacy outcome is the rate of change in brain white matter 
      hyperintensity volume on magnetic resonance imaging, a surrogate marker of 
      presumed ischemic damage, between baseline and 24 months follow-up. Secondary 
      outcomes include additional neuroradiological and clinical measures of efficacy 
      and safety. Exploratory outcomes include high-dose rivaroxaban pharmacokinetic 
      modeling. CONCLUSION: Should RISAPS demonstrate noninferior efficacy and safety 
      of high-dose rivaroxaban in this APS subgroup, it could justify larger 
      prospective randomized controlled trials.

TI  - [New oral anticoagulants - influence on coagulation tests].
PG  - 94-9
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1359920 [doi]
AB  - The new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) represent alternative antithrombotic agents 
      for prophylaxis and therapy of thromboembolic diseases. They act either by 
      inhibition of the clotting factor Xa or IIa (thrombin). As a consequence, they 
      influence several coagulation assays (for example prothrombin time, activated 
      partial thromboplastin time). Because of the short half-life of these new agents, 
      these changes show great variations in the course of 24 hours. Furthermore, there 
      are significant differences of laboratory results depending on the used reagents. 
      We explain the influence of apixaban, rivaroxaban (factor Xa inhibitors) and 
      dabigatran (thrombin inhibitor) on the most commonly used coagulation assays. 
      Besides we show that this influence depends on the way of action of the drug as 
      well as on the principle of the coagulation assay. Being aware of this 
      relationships helps to interpret the results of coagulation assays under 
      influence of NOACs correctly.

TI  - Andexanet alfa: a recombinant mimetic of human factor Xa for the reversal of 
      anticoagulant therapies.
PG  - 271-282
LID - 10.1358/dot.2017.53.5.2630780 [doi]
AB  - Activated coagulation factor X (FXa) is a common target for classic and newer 
      anticoagulants. Parenteral anticoagulants with an indirect inhibitory action on 
      FXa (low-molecular-weight heparins) have a well-established clinical efficacy in 
      the prophylaxis and therapy of thromboembolic conditions. More recently developed 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have emerged as a new class of antithrombotic 
      drugs. Rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban are direct inhibitors of FXa approved 
      for the management of venous thromboembolism and stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation. Although these DOACs are associated with fewer hemorrhagic side 
      effects than classic vitamin K antagonists, bleeding is still a main 
      complication. FXa antagonists had no specific agents that could reverse their 
      antihemostatic effects. Andexanet alfa is a modified, recombinant human FXa 
      molecule with an enhanced ability to bind to both direct and indirect FXa 
      inhibitors, but unable to contribute to blood coagulation mechanisms. Andexanet 
      alfa is designed to reverse the anticoagulant effects of FXa inhibitors. This 
      review will address the preclinical pharmacology and the main aspects of the 
      clinical development of andexanet alfa for the reversal of anticoagulant 
      therapies with an inhibitory action on FXa. It will also summarize additional 
      completed or ongoing studies on andexanet alfa available to the scientific 
      community until present.

TI  - Old and new oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism and atrial 
      fibrillation: a review of the literature.
PG  - 392-400
LID - 10.1016/j.thromres.2011.12.014 [doi]
AB  - Heparin, fondaparinux and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are effective for the 
      prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism. VKAs reduce by almost 60% the 
      rate of cardioembolic complications in patients with atrial fibrillation. The 
      risk for bleeding and the inconvenience for laboratory monitoring, dose 
      adjustment and drug or food interactions are the main limits for VKAs while 
      parenteral administration is the main limit for heparin and fondaparinux. New 
      oral anticoagulants with more predictable anticoagulant response and no need for 
      laboratory monitoring have been shown to be effective for the prevention and 
      treatment of venous thromboembolism and for the prevention of stroke and systemic 
      embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. The pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic profile of the new agents differ for mechanisms of action - 
      mainly anti Xa and one antithrombin agent- bioavailability, half life, renal or 
      live clearance. Drug interactions have been described with the new agents and 
      inhibitors or inducers of P-gp or CYP3A4. Overall, in the prevention of venous 
      thromboembolism after major elective orthopaedic surgery dabigatran was shown to 
      be non-inferior, rivaroxaban and apixaban to be superior to enoxaparin. Both, 
      rivaroxaban and dabigatran were shown to be non-inferior to low-molecular weight 
      heparin and VKAs for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. Dabigatran 150mg 
      twice daily reduced the incidence of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation respect to warfarin. In these patients 
      rivaroxaban and apixaban reduced the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke with a 
      similar incidence of ischemic stroke. No bleeding concern emerged with the new 
      anticoagulant agents in this indication.

TI  - Use of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Morbidly Obese Patients.
PG  - 72-83
LID - 10.1002/phar.2353 [doi]
AB  - In 2016, the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) published 
      guidelines advising caution when using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in 
      patients with morbid obesity due to limited clinical efficacy and safety data 
      supporting their use in this patient population. In this review, we analyzed 
      published articles in the MEDLINE database (from inception through May 29, 2019), 
      and the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and EMBASE databases (from inception 
      through April 26, 2019) that evaluated morbidly obese patients with atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) or venous thromboembolism (VTE) who received DOACs. A total of 
      19 studies, which included pharmacokinetic studies, original phase III trials for 
      the DOACs, post hoc analyses of phase III trials, and retrospective cohort 
      studies, were evaluated. Although currently available data do not indicate that 
      using DOACs in the morbidly obese is problematic, DOAC-specific pharmacokinetic 
      variations have been observed. Additionally, less data evaluating DOAC efficacy 
      and safety exist for VTE treatment compared with the data for stroke prevention 
      in patients with AF. The overall quality of the studies included in this review 
      was low due to limited prospective randomized trial data, limiting the ability to 
      form definitive judgments on efficacy and safety DOACs in the morbidly obese. 
      Continued caution is recommended when considering DOAC use in the morbidly obese, 
      particularly for those requiring anticoagulation for VTE treatment, until 
      additional higher-quality data become available.

AB  - Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin have traditionally been the major 
      therapeutic option for anticoagulation in clinical practice. VKAs are effective 
      and extensively recommended for the prevention of venous and arterial 
      thromboembolism in cardiovascular disease. Despite its effectiveness, warfarin is 
      limited by factors such as a narrow therapeutic index, drug-drug interactions, 
      food interactions, slow onset and offset of action, hemorrhage, and routine 
      anticoagulation monitoring to maintain therapeutic international normalized 
      ratio. During the last 2 decades, the approval of anticoagulants, such as 
      low-molecular-weight heparins, indirect factor Xa inhibitors (eg, fondaparinux), 
      and direct thrombin inhibitors (eg, argatroban, lepirudin, and desirudin), have 
      expanded the number of available antithrombotic compounds with additional targets 
      within the anticoagulation pathway. Although these medications offer several 
      potential therapeutic advantages, they all require parenteral or subcutaneous 
      administration and are substantially more expensive than VKAs. Thus, VKAs, 
      despite several limitations, have remained the major option for most patients 
      requiring chronic anticoagulation. These limitations have prompted interest in 
      the development of newer oral anticoagulants. Novel anticoagulants targeting 
      inhibition of factor Xa and thrombin (factor IIa) have now been incorporated into 
      clinical practice based on the results of large randomized clinical trials, with 
      the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of dabigatran for stroke 
      prevention in atrial fibrillation and rivaroxaban for deep vein thrombosis and 
      stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, with multiple other agents in various 
      stages of development for these and other indications. This review discusses the 
      pharmacological properties, clinical results, and therapeutic applications of 
      novel and new anticoagulants, thereby providing an outline for the future of 
      anticoagulation in cardiovascular disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dermatologic surgeons will increasingly encounter patients on novel 
      oral antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a 
      complete overview of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and side effects of 
      traditional and novel oral anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies along with 
      dietary supplements with anticoagulant or antiplatelet properties. METHODS: A 
      PubMed search was completed for "aspirin," "warfarin," "clopidogrel," 
      "dabigatran," "rivaroxaban," "apixaban," "prasugrel," and "ticagrelor." Review 
      articles and publications emphasizing perioperative management of oral 
      anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications were selected. An additional PubMed 
      search was completed for "hemorrhage," "bleeding," and "thrombosis" in 
      conjunction with "dermatology," "dermatologic surgery," and "cutaneous surgery." 
      RESULTS: Aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin have shortfalls in dosing, 
      monitoring, and efficacy. Several trials show superior efficacy with dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, and apixaban, with equal or reduced risk of bleeding compared with 
      warfarin. Prasugrel and ticagrelor may be associated with an increased bleeding 
      risk. Many over-the-counter medications also have anticoagulant properties with 
      associated bleeding risks that cannot be overlooked. LIMITATIONS: There are few 
      publications evaluating the novel oral anticoagulants' effects on outpatient 
      surgical procedures. CONCLUSION: Novel anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs are 
      revolutionizing therapy for cardiovascular diseases. As these medications become 
      more prevalent, dermatologists and dermatologic surgeons must be mindful of the 
      bleeding risk that will apply in our everyday practices.

TI  - Dosing issues with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for the treatment 
      of non-valvular atrial fibrillation: Why we should not underdose our patients.
PG  - 85-94
LID - S1875-2136(17)30155-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.acvd.2017.04.008 [doi]
AB  - Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) - dabigatran, rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban and edoxaban - are well established in terms of preventing stroke or 
      systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and high 
      thromboembolism risk. When prescribed incorrectly, NOACs are associated with an 
      increased risk of ischaemic events and bleeding. Current NOAC labels explicitly 
      address dose adjustments according to age, body weight, renal function and 
      concomitant treatment with P-glycoprotein inhibitors. The required dose 
      adjustments vary significantly from molecule to molecule, thereby creating a 
      complex dose adjustment environment. Furthermore, recommendations support 
      assessment of individual risk using thromboembolic and bleeding risk scores. 
      Evidence-based medicine also provides data about specific patient profiles. In 
      particular, some patients who are at higher risk of bleeding, such as patients on 
      polymedication, are often at higher risk of stroke. More and more patients are 
      being treated with NOACs. The question of appropriate dosing has become 
      important, as studies are starting to show that reduced doses are being 
      prescribed at very high rates. Although these data have not been evaluated in 
      light of individual risk assessments, in everyday practice, physicians are often 
      more concerned about drug-related bleeding than about the spontaneous evolution 
      of the disease (stroke/systemic embolism), leading to high rates of prescription 
      of inadequately low doses. Recent results have shown that only certain risk 
      criteria justify dose reduction. Thus, the right dose needs to be prescribed for 
      the right patient in order to obtain, in real-life practice, the benefits of 
      NOACs that have been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials.

TI  - Drug-drug interactions with direct oral anticoagulants for the prevention of 
      ischemic stroke and embolism in atrial fibrillation: a narrative review of 
      adverse events.
PG  - 313-328
LID - 10.1080/17512433.2023.2187376 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In randomized trials, direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) were 
      non-inferior to the vitamin-K-antagonist (VKA) warfarin in preventing 
      stroke/embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). DOAC are substrates 
      for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. The activity of these enzymes is 
      modulated by several drugs which might induce pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
      interactions (DDI). Drugs affecting platelet function have the potential for 
      pharmacodynamic DDI of DOAC. AREAS COVERED: The literature was searched for: 
      'dabigatran,' 'rivaroxaban,' 'edoxaban,' or 'apixaban' and drugs affecting 
      platelet function, CYP3A4-, CYP2C9- or P-gp-activity. Reports about bleeding and 
      embolic events attributed to DDI with DOAC in AF-patients were found for 43 of 
      171 drugs with interacting potential (25%), most frequently with antiplatelet and 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Whereas a co-medication of 
      platelet-affecting drugs is invariably reported to increase the bleeding risk, 
      the findings regarding P-gp-, CYP3A4- and CYP2C9- activity-affecting drugs are 
      ambiguous. EXPERT OPINION: Tests for plasma DOAC-levels and information about DDI 
      of DOAC should be widely available and user-friendly. If advantages and 
      disadvantages of DOAC and VKA can be investigated exhaustively, individualized 
      anticoagulant therapy can be offered to patients, considering co-medication, 
      comorbidities, genetic and geographic factors and the health care system.

AB  - Approximately half of patients started on an oral anticoagulant in the USA now 
      receive one of the newer direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Although there is an 
      approved reversal agent for the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, a specific 
      reversal agent for the anti-factor Xa (FXa) DOACs has yet to be licensed. Unlike 
      the strategy to reverse the only oral direct thrombin inhibitor with 
      idarucizumab, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment, a different 
      approach is necessary to design a single agent that can reverse multiple anti-FXa 
      medications. Andexanet alfa is a FXa decoy designed to reverse all anticoagulants 
      that act through this part of the coagulation cascade including anti-FXa DOACs, 
      such as apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, and indirect FXa inhibitors such as 
      low-molecular-weight heparins. This narrative reviews the development of 
      andexanet alfa and explores its basic science, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, 
      animal models, and human studies.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are still the most important cause of morbidity and 
      mortality worldwide and anti-thrombotic treatment is widely used as a result. The 
      currently used drugs include heparin and its derivatives, vitamin K antagonists, 
      though efficacious, have their own set of limitations like unpredictable 
      pharmacokinetic profile, parenteral route (with heparin and its derivatives 
      only), narrow therapeutic window, and constant laboratory monitoring for their 
      efficacy and safety. This lead to the development of novel factor Xa inhibitors 
      which could be given orally, have predictable dose response relationship and are 
      associated with lesser hemorrhagic complications. They include rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban among others. Apixaban has currently been approved for use 
      in patients undergoing total knee or hip replacement surgery and to prevent 
      stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Many trials are ongoing for apixaban 
      to firmly establish its place in future, among the anti-thrombotic drugs.

TI  - In vitro assessment of the risk of ABCB1-mediated drug-drug interaction between 
      rivaroxaban and tacrolimus in human embryonic kidney 293 recombinant cell lines.
PG  - 102521
LID - 10.1016/j.rpth.2024.102521 [doi]
LID - 102521
AB  - BACKGROUND: In lung transplant patients, direct oral anticoagulants are often 
      taken in combination with immunosuppressive drugs such as tacrolimus. Since 
      tacrolimus is a substrate and inhibitor of the efflux protein ABCB1, also 
      transporting direct oral anticoagulants, a possible drug-drug interaction 
      mediated by competition for this transporter needs to be investigated. 
      OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro effect of tacrolimus on ABCB1-mediated 
      rivaroxaban transport in order to support clinician practice. METHODS: 
      Recombinant cell line models, based on human embryonic kidney 293 cells, were 
      generated by a stable transfection process to overexpress ABCB1 or not (control 
      cells). The impact of tacrolimus on ABCB1-mediated rivaroxaban transport was 
      assessed by accumulation experiments. RESULTS: ABCB1 expression decreased the 
      cellular accumulation of rivaroxaban and tacrolimus at their respective 
      clinically relevant concentrations when compared with control cells. This 
      confirms the involvement of ABCB1 in the active transport of tacrolimus and 
      rivaroxaban. However, tacrolimus had no significant influence on rivaroxaban 
      disposition at those clinically relevant concentrations. CONCLUSION: Our study 
      does not provide evidence for a possible interaction between tacrolimus and 
      rivaroxaban when used together in practice.

TI  - Assessment of low plasma concentrations of apixaban in the periprocedural 
      setting.
PG  - 394-402
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.13202 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Estimation of residual apixaban plasma concentrations may be 
      requested in the management of emergencies. This study aims at assessing the 
      performance of specific anti-Xa assays calibrated with apixaban on real-life 
      samples with low apixaban plasma concentrations (<30 ng/mL) and on-treatment 
      ranges, with and without interference of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). 
      METHODS: The performance of the STA(®) -Liquid Anti-Xa assay (STA(®) LAX) and the 
      low and normal procedures of the Biophen(®) Direct Factor Xa Inhibitors (DiXaI) 
      assay was tested on 134 blood samples, collected from patients on apixaban, 
      wherefrom 74 patients received LMWH after apixaban cessation. The results were 
      compared with the liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS) measurements. RESULTS: The Biophen(®) DiXaI, Biophen(®) DiXaI LOW, and 
      STA(®) LAX showed very good correlation with LC-MS/MS measurements in patients 
      without LMWH administration (Spearman r .95, .99, and .98, respectively). Their 
      limits of quantitation were defined at 48, 24, and 12 ng/mL, respectively. The 
      Bland-Altman test measured mean bias (SD) at 5.6 (13.1), -2.5 (5.0), and -0.8 
      (6.1) ng/ml, respectively. The Spearman r of the Biophen(®) DiXaI decreased to 
      0.64 in presence of low apixaban concentrations. The Spearman r of the Biophen(®) 
      DiXaI LOW and STA(®) LAX decreased to 0.39 and 0.26, respectively, in presence of 
      LMWH. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of the low methodologies (Biophen(®) DiXaI LOW 
      and STA(®) LAX) is slightly improved for low apixaban plasma concentrations, 
      compared with the normal procedure of Biophen(®) DiXaI. The interference of LMWH 
      on the low methodologies is measurable, however, less important than the 
      previously reported interference of LMWH on rivaroxaban calibrated specific 
      anti-Xa assays.

TI  - Association of Oral Anticoagulants and Verapamil or Diltiazem With Adverse 
      Bleeding Events in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and Normal 
      Kidney Function.
PG  - e203593
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.3593 [doi]
LID - e203593
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are purported to have fewer 
      drug-drug interactions than warfarin. However, potential interactions with 
      coprescribed medications are still a safety concern. Verapamil hydrochloride and 
      diltiazem hydrochloride are combined P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CYP3A4 inhibitors 
      and may be associated with increases in the risk of bleeding with DOACs. 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of bleeding with DOACs and verapamil or diltiazem 
      using an active comparator design. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 
      comparative effectiveness active comparator cohort study was conducted using US 
      population-based data (2010-2015) analyzed between January 1 and July 15, 2019. 
      Data were obtained on 48 442 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who 
      had received an index prescription of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban 
      between October 19, 2010, through June 30, 2015, with final follow-up on October 
      1, 2015. Analysis was restricted to individuals with no history of kidney disease 
      who were receiving standard doses of the DOACs. EXPOSURES: Patients with initial 
      prescriptions of DOACs who were receiving verapamil or diltiazem were compared 
      with those receiving amlodipine or metoprolol. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Overall and gastrointestinal major, moderate, and minor bleeding using primary or 
      secondary diagnoses. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs were estimated using inverse 
      probability of treatment weights in Cox proportional hazards regression models. 
      RESULTS: Of the 48 442 patients reviewed, analysis was conducted on 1764 patients 
      receiving DOACs with verapamil or diltiazem compared with 3105 receiving 
      amlodipine and 1793 patients receiving DOACs with verapamil or diltiazem compared 
      with 3224 receiving metoprolol. Depending on the comparison, approximately 60% of 
      the cohort were younger than 65 years and male, which differed by treatment 
      group. Rivaroxaban and apixaban were not associated with increased rates of 
      bleeding for patients receiving verapamil or diltiazem compared with those 
      receiving amlodipine or metoprolol. Among patients receiving dabigatran 
      etexilate, the overall bleeding rate was 52% higher (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 
      1.05-2.20) with verapamil or diltiazem vs amlodipine and 43% higher (hazard 
      ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.02-2.00) vs metoprolol. Bleeding rates for dabigatran with 
      verapamil or diltiazem were higher overall for other bleeding types (244.9 vs 
      158.4 per 1000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratios of overall GI bleeding: 2.16; 
      95% CI, 1.30-3.60; minor bleeding: 1.56; 95% CI, 1.07-2.27; and minor GI 
      bleeding: 2.16; 95% CI, 1.29-3.63). Sensitivity analyses showed consistent 
      results for dabigatran when used with verapamil and diltiazem, with magnitudes 
      ranging from 50% to 100% increased hazard rates and no significant results for 
      apixaban or rivaroxaban. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Current US prescribing 
      information only recommends prescribing changes with dabigatran and P-gp 
      inhibitors with lower kidney function. This study found increased bleeding risk 
      associated with dabigatran when used concomitantly with the P-gp inhibitors 
      verapamil and diltiazem in individuals with normal kidney function. Clinicians 
      and patients may need to consider these drug-drug interactions when choosing oral 
      anticoagulation.

TI  - Plasma levels do not predict thrombin generation in patients taking direct oral 
      anticoagulants.
PG  - 1539-1548
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.13618 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antithrombotic effect of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) in 
      specific clinical scenarios is difficult to assess. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed 
      to evaluate the effect of DOAC on thrombin generation (TG) in relation to their 
      plasma level. METHODS: Eighty patients newly started on anticoagulation were 
      included, 20 patients for each DOAC-apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and 
      dabigatran. Plasma was sampled before DOAC (baseline), at plasma peak time, 6 and 
      12 hours after starting DOAC for quantification of drug levels and TG. RESULTS: 
      The baseline TG before DOAC intake showed inter-individual variability. All DOACs 
      significantly prolonged lag time (LT) and time to peak (TTP), but did not change 
      endogenous thrombin potential (ETP). Anti-Xa inhibitors but not dabigatran 
      reduced thrombin peak, but the effect of apixaban at plasma peak was less 
      pronounced (factor 1.6). LT and TTP prolongation of dabigatran was lower compared 
      to anti-Xa inhibitors. All DOACs showed a nonlinear dose-response relationship, 
      with the greatest antithrombotic effect at lower DOAC plasma levels. The 
      inhibition of TG parameters between baseline and peak was parallel between 
      individual patients but the coefficient of variation of TG was lower compared to 
      drug levels. CONCLUSION: The antithrombotic effect at DOAC peak plasma level 
      measured by TG depends on the patient-specific baseline TG level and the 
      drug-specific inhibition by the particular DOAC. Although peak plasma levels have 
      a high variability, the variation of TG is lower compared to drug levels. 
      Therefore, TG assays may be superior to plasma levels in the assessment of the 
      intensity of anticoagulation.

AB  - Currently, there are several lines of evidence supporting the interplay between 
      coagulation and inflammation in the propagation of various disease processes, 
      including venous thromboembolism (VTE) and inflammatory diseases. Major advances 
      in the development of oral anticoagulants have resulted in considerable progress 
      toward the goal of safe and effective oral anticoagulants that do not require 
      frequent monitoring or dose adjustment and have minimal food/drug interactions. 
      Indirect inhibitors such as low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and the 
      pentasaccharide fondaparinux represent improvements over traditional drugs such 
      as unfractionated heparin for acute treatment of VTE, constituting a more 
      targeted anticoagulant approach with predictable pharmacokinetic profiles and no 
      requirement for monitoring. Vitamin K antagonist, with its inherent limitations 
      in terms of multiple food and drug interactions and frequent need for monitoring, 
      remains the only oral anticoagulant approved for long-term secondary 
      thromboprophylaxis in VTE. The oral-direct thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran was 
      withdrawn from the world market due to safety concerns. Newer anticoagulant drugs 
      such as parenteral pentasaccharides (idraparinux, SSR126517E), novel oral-direct 
      thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran), oral-direct factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, YM-150, DU-176b), and tissue factor/factor VIIa complex inhibitors have 
      been "tailor-made" to target specific procoagulant complexes and have the 
      potential to greatly expand oral antithrombotic targets for both acute and 
      long-term treatment of VTE, acute coronary syndromes, and for the prevention of 
      stroke in atrial fibrillation patients.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in elderly patients with atrial 
      fibrillation and is an independent risk factor for stroke. Warfarin 
      anticoagulation is efficacious for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation 
      patients with moderate CKD (stage III, estimated glomerular filtration rate 30-59 
      mL/min), but recent observational studies have challenged its value for patients 
      with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. The novel oral anticoagulants 
      (i.e., dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban) all undergo renal metabolism to varying 
      degrees, and hence dosing, efficacy, and safety require special consideration in 
      CKD patients. In randomized trials to date involving 11,169 patients with 
      moderate CKD, the novel oral anticoagulants performed well, with similar efficacy 
      and safety profiles as for non-CKD patients. For atrial fibrillation patients 
      with stage III CKD, the available data are strongest for dabigatran 150 mg twice 
      daily as superior to warfarin for stroke prevention and for apixaban as superior 
      to warfarin regarding reduced major hemorrhage. Renal function should be 
      monitored at least annually in patients receiving a novel oral anticoagulant, and 
      more often in elderly patients and those with underlying CKD or comorbidities who 
      are at special risk for dehydration and deterioration of renal function. Much 
      remains to be learned about the optimal use of the novel oral anticoagulants in 
      CKD patients; additional studies about optimal dosing of the novel oral 
      anticoagulants and frequency of monitoring renal function in CKD patients with 
      atrial fibrillation are needed. Anticoagulation options for hemodialysis patients 
      require testing in randomized trials.

TI  - Pharmacogenetics of Direct Oral Anticoagulants: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/jpm11010037 [doi]
LID - 37
AB  - Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban are direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs). Their inter-individual variability in pharmacodynamics 
      and pharmacokinetics (transport and metabolism) is high, and could result from 
      genetic polymorphisms. As recommended by the French Network of Pharmacogenetics 
      (RNPGx), the management of some treatments in cardiovascular diseases (as 
      antiplatelet agents, oral vitamin K antagonists, and statins) can rely on genetic 
      testing in order to improve healthcare by reducing therapeutic resistance or 
      toxicity. This paper is a review of association studies between single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and systemic exposure variation of DOACs. Most of the 
      results presented here have a lot to do with some SNPs of CES1 (rs2244613, 
      rs8192935, and rs71647871) and ABCB1 (rs1128503, rs2032582, rs1045642, and 
      rs4148738) genes, and dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. Regarding edoxaban 
      and betrixaban, as well as SNPs in the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes, literature is 
      scarce, and further studies are needed.

TI  - Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 385-91
LID - 10.1038/nrcardio.2012.19 [doi]
AB  - Safe and effective stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) is crucial as 
      the number of patients with this condition continues to increase. Several novel 
      oral anticoagulants are being developed as replacements for warfarin for this 
      indication. Direct factor Xa inhibitors comprise the largest class of oral 
      anticoagulants in development; the inhibition of factor Xa is recognized to be a 
      promising target for therapeutic anticoagulation, partly because of its location 
      in the coagulation cascade. Apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are 
      small-molecule, selective inhibitors that directly and reversibly bind to the 
      active site of factor Xa. Their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles 
      vary, which might allow patient-specific therapy. Several of these agents have 
      been tested in clinical trials for various indications, including AF, with 
      favorable results. In particular, apixaban and rivaroxaban have shown superiority 
      and noninferiority, respectively, to warfarin in phase III clinical trials for 
      stroke prevention in AF. These agents have also been shown to be safe in terms of 
      bleeding risk. Despite these advantages, factor Xa inhibitors have several 
      characteristics, such as potential interactions with other drugs (inhibitors of 
      cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein) and the inability to reverse their 
      anticoagulant effects, as well as concerns about poor patient compliance, which 
      must be considered when initiating patients on a novel factor Xa inhibitor.

AB  - Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections are one of the most frequent 
      infectious disease requiring hospitalization for treatment. Delafloxacin is a 
      clinically approved fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of ABSSSIs. In 
      spite of being marketed since 2017, there is no published analytical method for 
      quantification of delafloxacin in biological samples. Herein, a selective and 
      sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for quantitative analysis 
      of delafloxacin in rat plasma and rabbit aqueous humour samples. The liquid 
      liquid extraction (using ethyl acetate) was used for analyte extraction form rat 
      plasma, whereas protein precipitation (acetonitrile) was used for aqueous humour 
      samples preparations. An Acquity UPLC BEH C(18) column was used for 
      chromatographic separation of delafloxacin and internal standard (rivaroxaban). 
      The mobile phase composition of acetonitrile (containing 0.1% formic acid) and 
      10 mM ammonium acetate in ratio of 60:40 were used for sample elution at 
      300 µL/min flow rate. The electrospray ionization operated in positive mode was 
      used for sample ionization and detection of analyte and internal standard were 
      performed by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The MRM transitions were 
      set to 441.14 > 379.09 and 436.89 > 144.87 for delafloxacin and internal 
      standard, respectively. The method was validated as per USFDA guideline for 
      bioanalytical method and all the evaluated parameters were within the acceptable 
      ranges. The developed method in plasma was successfully used to analyze samples

TI  - Bleeding in patients receiving non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants: clinical trial 
      evidence.
PG  - 361-380
LID - 10.1177/1753944718801554 [doi]
AB  - In optimizing anticoagulation therapy, it is essential to balance treatment 
      efficacy with the major adverse effect of anticoagulant treatment, bleeding risk. 
      This narrative review examines the efficacy and safety of the non-vitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and 
      edoxaban compared with standard anticoagulation or placebo. NOAC therapies 
      provide equivalent to superior protection versus standard therapy, with similar 
      or superior safety, and potential benefits in convenience. We will review the 
      phase III evidence for each of the available NOACs in different antithrombotic 
      indications, including atrial fibrillation (in the absence of significant mitral 
      stenosis or mechanical heart valves); prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
      in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery; and acute and long-term treatment of 
      VTE. Further, we will illustrate scenarios in which the evidence is stronger for 
      a particular agent in the context of the overall positive safety and efficacy 
      profile of NOACs in general. Limitations of the factor Xa inhibitors include the 
      lack of a specific antidote in case of a bleeding emergency (an approved agent is 
      available for reversing the effect of the direct thrombin inhibitor). We discuss 
      the options for mitigating bleeding and describe the ongoing developments towards 
      specific reversal agents. In conclusion, the available data for efficacy and 
      safety, together with reliable pharmacokinetics obviating the need for regular 
      monitoring, indicate that NOACs may offer substantial benefits for patients with 
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or VTE.

AB  - The novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) represent a major advance in the treatment 
      of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism 
      (VTE). They have several advantages over vitamin-K antagonists such as warfarin, 
      including more predictable pharmacokinetics and improved safety, particularly 
      with fatal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. However, several issues remain 
      surrounding the use of NOACs in certain subpopulations and with the approach to 
      reversal. The periprocedural management of anticoagulation with these relatively 
      new agents can also present several challenges. This article reviews the basic 
      pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of these drugs. Several populations at higher 
      risk for complications with use of NOACs are discussed, including those 
      undergoing procedures. Finally, several target-specific reversal agents have 
      either received FDA approval or likely will be approved in the near future; these 
      agents and their roles in the approach to anticoagulation reversal will also be 
      discussed.

AB  - Oral direct inhibitors of thrombin and activated factor Xa are approved as new 
      anticoagulant drugs. In contrast to vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and heparins, the 
      new agents have single targets in the coagulation cascade and more predictable 
      pharmacokinetics, but they lack validated and available antidotes. Unlike VKA, 
      they do not require routine monitoring of coagulation. However, the measurement 
      of their pharmacologic effects might be of value in selected patients. They 
      interfere with the routine coagulation tests, which should be interpreted with 
      caution. Specific tests exist and can be used in case of emergencies. Adequate 
      supportive care and temporary removal of all antithrombotic agents constitute the 
      basis for management of serious bleeding complications. The administration of 
      coagulation factors, such as fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex 
      concentrates or recombinant activated FVII, can benefit in life-threatening 
      bleeding or emergency surgery. Specific antidotes for non-vitamin K oral 
      anticoagulants are in clinical development. This review aims at answering in a 
      brief and simplified manner some clinical questions.

TI  - Choosing Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants: Practical Considerations 
      We Need to Know.
PG  - 531-541
AB  - BACKGROUND: Warfarin is a well-established agent for use in the prevention of 
      stroke or systemic embolic event (SEE) in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF) and for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). 
      However, management of patients requiring oral anticoagulation with warfarin can 
      be complicated by the need for frequent monitoring, drug-drug and drug-food 
      interactions, and a variable response based on genetic polymorphisms. The 
      non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were developed as 
      alternatives to warfarin; they do not require routine monitoring and have 
      predictable pharmacokinetics, fewer drug-drug interactions, and limited drug-food 
      interactions. Four NOACs-dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban-have 
      received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of 
      stroke or SEE in NVAF and for the treatment of VTE. Selecting the most 
      appropriate agent for each patient should be done in consideration of patient 
      preferences and characteristics, including renal function, bleeding risk, and the 
      need for other medications. METHODS: A search was performed on the terms atrial 
      fibrillation and venous thromboembolism with individual terms dabigatran, 
      apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban to identify relevant manuscripts; large 
      randomized clinical trials, metaanalyses, and treatment guideline recommendations 
      were given preference. Searches to identify registries, treatment guidelines, and 
      metaanalyses relevant to specific subgroups were also used. RESULTS: NOACs are 
      effective in reducing the risk of stroke or SEE in patients with NVAF and are 
      associated with fewer incidents of intracranial bleeding vs warfarin. CONCLUSION: 
      NOACs provide a convenient and safe alternative to warfarin and may result in 
      improved therapeutic outcomes for patients with NVAF or VTE. The use of NOACs in 
      other indications and patient populations is under investigation, and clinical 
      trials investigating their use in acute coronary syndrome, medically ill 
      patients, percutaneous coronary intervention, cardioversion, catheter ablation, 
      coronary arterial disease, and heart failure have been announced.

TI  - Laboratory testing in the era of direct or non-vitamin K antagonist oral 
      anticoagulants: a practical guide to measuring their activity and avoiding 
      diagnostic errors.
PG  - 208-27
LID - 10.1055/s-0035-1546827 [doi]
AB  - A new generation of antithrombotic agents has recently emerged. These provide 
      direct inhibition of either thrombin (factor IIa [FIIa]) or FXa, and are 
      increasingly replacing the classical anticoagulants (heparin and coumarins such 
      as warfarin) in clinical practice for a variety of conditions. These agents have 
      been designated several acronyms, including NOACs, DOACs, and TSOACs, 
      respectively, referring to new (novel; non-vitamin K antagonist) oral 
      anticoagulants, direct oral anticoagulants, and target-specific oral 
      anticoagulants, and currently include dabigatran (FIIa inhibitor), and 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban (FXa inhibitors). The pervading 
      mantra that NOACs do not require laboratory monitoring is countered by ongoing 
      recognition that laboratory testing for drug effects is needed in many 
      situations. Moreover, since these agents "do not require" laboratory monitoring, 
      some clinicians inappropriately take this to mean that they do not affect 
      hemostasis tests. This review aims to briefly review the laboratory studies that 
      have evaluated the NOACs against a wide range of laboratory assays to assess 
      utility for qualitative or quantitative measurements of these drugs, as well as 
      interferences that may cause misdiagnosis of hemostatic defects. Point of care 
      testing, including use of alternate samples such as urine and serum, is also 
      under development but is not covered extensively in this review. The main aims of 
      this article are to provide practical guidance to general laboratory testing for 
      NOACs, as well as to help avoid diagnostic errors associated with hemostasis 
      testing performed on samples from treated patients, as these currently comprise 
      major challenges to hemostasis laboratories in the era of the NOACs.

TI  - Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation: A Clinical Perspective on Trials of the 
      Novel Oral Anticoagulants.
PG  - 201-14
LID - 10.1007/s10557-015-6632-3 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm disturbance; its incidence 
      increases with age, and it is also an independent risk factor for stroke. 
      Anticoagulation has been proven as the most effective way to reduce the risk of 
      stroke in patients with AF, and vitamin K antagonists have been used for decades 
      as the gold standard treatment. Vitamin K antagonists have a narrow therapeutic 
      window in addition to variable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and they 
      frequently interact with food and other drugs, requiring coagulation monitoring 
      to ensure balance between safety and efficacy. The novel oral anticoagulants 
      (NOACs) dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban selectively target either 
      thrombin or Factor Xa and have predictable pharmacologic profiles, removing the 
      need for routine coagulation monitoring. This article summarizes phase III data 
      in patient subtypes and discusses controversies surrounding AF management with 
      these agents. Results indicate that NOACs in non-valvular AF have an overall 
      improved efficacy-safety profile compared with warfarin. Significantly fewer 
      fatal bleeding events were observed in patients randomized to rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, or edoxaban compared with those on warfarin, and significant reductions 
      in the incidence of life-threatening bleeding were observed in patients 
      randomized to dabigatran. All four pivotal trials testing the NOACs against 
      warfarin showed significantly lower rates of intracranial bleeding in patients 
      administered NOACs. These results suggest that wider use of NOACs has the 
      potential to improve outcomes for most patients with AF.

TI  - Assessment of novel oral anticoagulant use within a community teaching hospital.
PG  - 93-98
LID - 10.1016/j.jsps.2016.02.002 [doi]
AB  - Background: Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are considered to be at least as 
      effective and safe as warfarin with several advantages such as predictable 
      pharmacokinetics, allowing for standardized dosing without monitoring, a lack of 
      food interactions and fewer drug interactions; however, their misuse could 
      potentially result in patient harm. Objective: To evaluate the appropriate use of 
      the NOACs within a community teaching hospital. SETTING: A community teaching 
      hospital in the United States. Method: A retrospective chart review of patients 
      that were prescribed dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban at our institution from 
      October 2012 through November 2014 was conducted. Main outcome measure: The 
      primary objective was to determine the percentage of patients that were 
      appropriately prescribed NOACs. Secondary objectives were to determine the number 
      of patients who were inappropriately transitioned from warfarin or parenteral 
      anticoagulants to a NOAC or vice versa, the number of incidents when a NOAC was 
      held or discontinued inappropriately before a procedure and the number of 
      bleeding or thrombotic events while taking a NOAC. Results: Of the 113 patients 
      receiving therapy with an NOAC, appropriate prescribing was observed in 79.7%. 
      Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban were appropriately prescribed in 73.8%, 
      88.3%, and 85.8% of patients respectively. Lack of renal dose-adjustment in 
      patients with reduced renal function was the most common reason for inappropriate 
      use (8.8%). Ten out of 38 patients (26%) were inappropriately transitioned 
      from/to other anticoagulants. Two out of six patients underwent a procedure 
      without holding NOACs as recommended prior to surgery. Of all patients receiving 
      NOACs, a total of 3 bleeding incidents were observed, one with each NOAC. 
      Conclusion: The NOACs were appropriately prescribed for the majority of patients 
      within our institution. Future efforts however should focus on ensuring 
      appropriate dose adjustments for renal impairment, procedures for transitioning 
      between NOACs and parenteral anticoagulants, and adequate withholding times for 
      NOACs prior to surgery in order to optimize the management of NOACs usage within 
      our institution.

AB  - Objectives For revealing the peculiarities of the drug-drug interaction of 
      rivaroxaban (substrate CYP3A4 and P-gp) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) 
      (verapamil - inhibitor CYP3A4 and P-gp and amlodipine - substrate CYP3A4) in 
      patients 80 years and older with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NAF) we studied 
      128 patients. Methods All patients were divided into groups depending on the 
      therapy taken: the 1st - rivaroxaban + amlodipine (n=51), the 2nd - rivaroxaban + 
      verapamil (n=30), the control group - rivaroxaban without CCBs (n=47). A trough 
      steady-state plasma concentration (C min,ss) of rivaroxaban, prothrombin time 
      (PT) in the blood plasma and the event of clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) 
      bleeding were assessed for each patient. Results Patient in group 2 had higher C 
      min,ss of rivaroxaban, PT and CRNM than subjects in the control group (Me 73.8 
      [50.6-108.8] ng/mL vs. 40.5 [25.6-74.3] ng/mL; Me 14.8 [13.4-17.3] s vs. 13.8 
      [12.6-14.4] s; 34% vs. 13%, respectively, p<0.05 for all). When compared, the PT 
      and complication rate in group 1 with the control group C min,ss of rivaroxaban 
      were practically the same (p>0.05 for all). Conclusions In patients ≥80 years 
      with NAF, the use of rivaroxaban in combination with verapamil may not be safe 
      and can lead to CRNM bleeding.

TI  - Use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants in solid organ transplantation: A 
      systematic review.
PG  - 28-43
LID - 10.1002/phar.2485 [doi]
AB  - The use of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has increased secondary to 
      the mounting evidence for comparable efficacy and potentially superior safety to 
      vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in the general population. However, insufficient 
      data regarding DOAC use in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients and numerous 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations limit their use in this highly 
      selected patient population. A systematic review of recent clinical evidence on 
      the safety and efficacy of DOACs compared to VKAs in SOT recipients was 
      conducted. Additional considerations including transplant-specific strategies for 
      DOAC reversal and common pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic concerns were also 
      reviewed. Although current evidence is limited to single-center retrospective 
      analyses, DOACs, especially apixaban, appear to be a safe and effective 
      alternative to VKAs for SOT recipients with stable graft function and without 
      drug-drug interactions. Reliable data on DOAC reversal at the time of transplant 
      surgery are lacking, and clinicians should consider idarucizumab, andexanet alfa, 
      and other non-specific reversal agents on an individual patient basis. There is 
      no evidence supporting deviations from the Food and Drug Administration labeling 
      recommendations for DOAC dosing in the setting of drug-drug interactions, 
      obesity, and renal function, especially in patients on hemodialysis.

TI  - [New oral anticoagulants (NOAC) in nephrology].
LID - gin/33.4.12 [pii]
AB  - The new or direct oral anticoagulants [new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) or direct 
      oral anticoagulants (DOAC)] were launched in the Italian market in 2013. Although 
      these compounds share common pharmacological indications with vitamin K 
      antagonists (warfarin or acenocumarol), they have different mechanisms of action, 
      do not require a constant anticoagulant monitoring but are more efficacious and 
      safer than vitamin K antagonists. The use of these molecules (Dabigatran, 
      Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, Betrixaban, Edoxaban) is constantly rising in daily 
      practice. However, while available data suggest that NOAC/DOAC use is safe, 
      dosage should be adjusted based on renal or liver function. It should be 
      acknowledged that commonly available blood tests [Prothrombin Time (PT) and 
      partial thromboplastin time (PTT)] are not indicated to monitor the anticoagulant 
      activity of these compounds. With the exception of dabigatran, we currently lack 
      of an antidote to reverse the anticoagulant effect of NOAC/DOAC. We herein review 
      available evidence on NOAC/DOAC pharmacokinetic, risk factors for bleeding, 
      interventions to reverse the anticoagulant activity in case of hemorrhages or 
      need of urgent surgery and/or NOAC/DOAC overdose or side effects.

TI  - NOAC or Warfarin for Atrial Fibrillation: Does Time in Therapeutic Range Matter?
PG  - 60-4
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest cardiac arrhythmia currently affecting 
      1-2% of the general population, with stroke being one of its most fearsome 
      complications. Dose-adjusted warfarin is an established treatment for reduction 
      of thromboembolic risk but mandates dietary restrictions and need for routine 
      blood monitoring. Novel oral anticoagulants (Dabigatran - patent: 
      US20110082299A1, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim; Rivaroxaban - patent: 
      US20150175590A1, manufactured by Bayer; Apixaban - patent: US20140335178A1, 
      manufactured jointly by Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb; Edoxaban - patent: 
      WO2013026553A1, manufactured by Daiichi Sankyo) have recently been introduced 
      that might provide at least equal reduction in thromboembolic risk to patients; 
      negating the need for dietary restrictions and routine blood tests. The most 
      recent National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, UK guidelines from 
      August 2014 suggest consideration of one of the novel oral anticoagulants if the 
      time in therapeutic range is less than 65%. In this study, the evidence for four 
      novel oral anticoagulants is reviewed and the anticoagulation success with 
      warfarin with atrial fibrillation and mechanical heart valves assessed in a large 
      UK District General Hospital. Fifty-eight patients were identified with 
      mechanical heart valve and 2737 patients with atrial fibrillation. Patients with 
      atrial fibrillation had a significantly better TTR when compared with the 
      patients included in the NOAC trials. Our results were similar with the Auricula 
      registry. However, 25% of patients had TTR<65% and they would need to be 
      considered for NOACs. Our data suggest that the degree of benefit seen in the 
      NOAC trials might not be expected in our cohort of patients with atrial 
      fibrillation. Interestingly, our patients with atrial fibrillation had a much 
      better mean TTR of 76.4% and required less INR tests (12/year) compared to 
      patients with mechanical heart valve who had a mean TTR of 61.4% and required 
      more INR tests (26/year).

AB  - Bemiparin is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) indicated for the acute 
      treatment of deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism, for the 
      prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in surgical and non-surgical patients and 
      for the prevention of clotting in the extracorporeal circuit during hemodialysis. 
      Due to its excellent pharmacological profile-the second-generation LMWH with the 
      lowest molecular weight, the longest half-life and the highest anti-Factor 
      Xa/anti-Factor IIa activity ratio-it can be safely used in special categories of 
      patients (children, elderly, patients with renal impairment and congestive heart 
      failure). Several studies demonstrated its safety and efficacy, while cost 
      analyses show the economic benefits of bemiparin treatment as compared to other 
      heparins. Recent evidences suggested the application of bemiparin even in the 
      management of diabetic foot ulcers. The aim of this narrative review was to 
      evaluate literature according to results coming from studies involving bemiparin 
      administration in various clinical conditions.

TI  - The European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the Use of New Oral 
      Anticoagulants in Patients with Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation - A Brief 
      Summary.
PG  - 115-9
LID - 10.15420/aer.2013.2.2.115 [doi]
AB  - New oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative to vitamin K antagonists 
      (VKAs) in the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation (AF). The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) has produced a 
      practical guide to detail the use of NOACs in clinical practice. The guide 
      includes a practical start-up and follow-up scheme, emphasising the importance of 
      strict adherence to the regimen - the anticoagulant effect drops rapidly after 
      12-24 hours. There is also guidance on how to measure the anticoagulant effect of 
      NOACs, switching between anticoagulant regimes and dealing with dosing errors. 
      Physicians will have to consider the pharmacokinetic effect of drugs and 
      co-morbidities when prescribing NOACs - plasma levels of NOACs may be affected by 
      P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates, as well as cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) inducers or 
      inhibitors. In patients with chronic kidney disease, reduced doses of NOACs may 
      be indicated. Guidance is also given on the management of bleeding complications, 
      and the cessation and reinitiation of NOACs in patients undergoing surgical 
      interventions. Finally, the use of NOACs in specific clinical situations is 
      considered; these include patients with AF and coronary artery disease (CAD), 
      patients presenting with acute stroke while taking NOACs and patients with 
      cancer.

TI  - Direct-acting oral anticoagulant drug level monitoring in clinical patient 
      management.
PG  - 543-549
LID - 10.1007/s11239-018-1643-0 [doi]
AB  - The role of drug-level monitoring among patients using direct-acting oral 
      anticoagulant (DOAC) is unclear. We aimed to investigate its 'real-life' 
      utilization and effect on clinical management. A review of records of patients 
      who underwent DOAC level testing during 2013-2017. Overall, 212 patients (median 
      age 77 years) underwent 292 DOAC measurements [apixaban (n = 147), rivaroxaban 
      (n = 102), dabigatran (n = 43)]. Monitoring volume increased by 460% during study 
      period. DOAC level testing was performed during routine follow-up in 51 (17.5%) 
      cases, whereas the remaining 241 (82.5%) measurements were performed due to 
      selected clinical circumstances, most commonly: bleeding (n = 60), perioperative 
      status (n = 45), breakthrough thrombosis (n = 37) and renal failure (n = 35). 
      Drug levels were within the expected range in 210 (71.9%), above the expected 
      range in 62 (21.2%) and lower than expected range in 20 (6.8%). In multivariate 
      analysis, older age (P = 0.005), lower glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.001) and 
      lower body mass index (P = 0.006) were associated with DOAC levels above the 
      expected range. Clinical decisions were affected by DOAC monitoring following 
      most (140/241, 58.1%) measurements for which we identified an indication for 
      testing; yet only rarely when monitoring was performed during routine follow-up 
      (7.8%, 4/51) (P < 0.0001). While no benefit of routine DOAC monitoring was 
      observed, drug level measurement has an important role in the management of 
      patients in selected circumstances. Age, body weight and creatinine clearance 
      were found to be significant predictors of drug levels. Future studies are 
      warranted to establish associations between drug levels and outcomes, and better 
      delineate the role of DOAC monitoring.

TI  - Implications of apixaban for dental treatments.
PG  - e611-e614
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anticoagulation therapy is used in several conditions to prevent or 
      treat thromboembolism. Recently, new oral anticoagulants have been introduced as 
      alternatives to warfarin and acenocoumarol. In Europe, the European Medicines 
      Agency has approved dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban. Their advantages 
      include: predictable pharmacokinetics, drug interactions and limited food, rapid 
      onset of action and short half-life. However, they lack a specific reversal 
      agent. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted through November 
      2015 for publications in the ISI Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane 
      Library using the keywords "apixaban", "rivaroxaban", "dabigatran", "new oral 
      anticoagulants", "dental treatment" and "dental implications". We included 
      studies published in English and Spanish over the last 10 years. RESULTS: 
      Apixaban has been recently introduced in the daily medical practices for the 
      control of thromboembolism. The number of patients taking apixaban is increasing. 
      Management of patients on anticoagulation therapy requires that dentists can 
      accurately assess the patient prior to dental treatments. It is important for 
      dentists to have a sound understanding of the mechanisms of action and management 
      guidelines for patients taking new oral anticoagulants. CONCLUSIONS: The dentist 
      should consider carefully the management of patients on apixaban. This paper sets 
      out a clinical guidance of dental practitioners treating these patients. There is 
      a need for further clinical studies in order to establish more evidence-based 
      guidelines for dental patients requiring apixaban. Key words:Apixaban, new oral 
      anticoagulants, dental treatment.

TI  - New oral anticoagulants in non-valvular atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 53-60
LID - 10.1007/s40292-013-0011-6 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of embolic stroke. 
      Dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to a target international normalized 
      ratio (INR) range of 2.0-3.0 reduce the risk of ischemic stroke and are currently 
      recommended in all patients with AF at moderate-high risk for stroke or systemic 
      embolism. However, VKAs have several drawbacks, including unpredictable 
      anticoagulant response, food and drug interactions, need for regular laboratory 
      monitoring and dose adjustment. These limitations prompted the introduction of 
      new oral anticoagulants (NOA) that target thrombin and factor Xa, key-enzymes in 
      the coagulation pathway. NOA have predictable pharmacodynamics, allowing fixed 
      dosing without the need of laboratory monitoring, and have few drug and food 
      interactions. The present review focuses on pharmacological properties, safety, 
      and appropriate clinical use of dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban.

AB  - Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a potentially fatal and avoidable medical 
      condition that poses a burden on global health care costs. The rate of major GIB 
      related to the use of some direct acting oral anticoagulant drugs (DOACs), is 
      higher than that detected in warfarin users. Current strategies in the treatment 
      of GIBs in patients receiving warfarin or DOACs (vitamin K, activated charcoal; 
      hemodialysis; recombinant factor VIIa; [activated] prothrombin complex 
      concentrates) including indications for the treatment of bleeding based on 
      different degrees of severity of the episodes, is reported in this article. 
      Potential preventive strategies to mitigate the risk of GIBs (e.g. upper 
      endoscopy/biopsy, colon cancer screening; eradication of Helicobacter pylori 
      prior to starting anticoagulation; use of proton-pump inhibitors, identification 
      of risk factors for bleeding) are also reported as well as the fact that some of 
      them have not been tested so far in patients receiving DOACs. Antidotes that 
      experimentally reverse the anti-coagulant effect of dabigatran (Idarucizumab; BI 
      655075; Boehringer Ingelheim); of rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban (Andexanet 
      alfa, r-Antidote, PRT064445; Portola Pharmaceuticals) or of all DOACs (Aripazine, 
      PER-977, ciraparantag; Perosphere Inc.) are discussed. Likewise, population 
      pharmacokinetics modeling related to the rate of major DOACs-related GIBs is 
      presented. It is also emphasized that the occurrence of GIB reflects the presence 
      of patients at the highest risk for adverse outcomes. Finally, the implications 
      of the concept that patient characteristics and the severity of illness (i.e. 
      comorbidities) exert a greater impact on the risk of GIB than the type of 
      antithrombotic agent employed, are analyzed.

TI  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs): From the laboratory point of view.
PG  - 459-482
LID - 10.2478/acph-2022-0034 [doi]
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) represent a new generation of drugs that have 
      been increasingly used in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic states. 
      According to the mechanism of anticoagulant action, DOACs are divided into two 
      groups: direct inhibitors of thrombin (dabigatran) and direct inhibitors of 
      activated factor X (FXa) (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban). Compared 
      to the vitamin K antagonists, DOACs are superior in terms of onset of action, 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties and fixed daily dose without the 
      need for routine coagulation monitoring. Despite these advantages, there are 
      clinical conditions in which laboratory measurement of DOACs should be performed. 
      Although DOACs have an impact on screening haemostasis assays (prothrombin time, 
      PT; activated partial thromboplastin time, aPTT; and thrombin time, TT), these 
      tests are not appropriate for quantifying drug levels. Therefore, specific 
      quantitative methods (LC-MS/MS as a gold standard method for all DOACs, 
      coagulometric and chromogenic assays for dabigatran, and chromogenic anti-Xa 
      assays with drug-specific calibrators for inhibitors of FXa) should only be used 
      for determination of DOACs concentration. The aim of this review is to present 
      all aspects of laboratory assessment of DOACs, including pre-analytical, 
      analytical and post-analytical factors in the overall testing process with a 
      special accent on the available specific quantitative methods for measurement of 
      DOACs in circulation.

BTI - Safety, Effectiveness, and Cost-Effectiveness of New Oral Anticoagulants Compared 
      with Warfarin in Preventing Stroke and Other Cardiovascular Events in Patients 
      with Atrial Fibrillation
AB  - Approximately 250,000 Canadians are affected by atrial fibrillation (AF). Stroke 
      is a complication of AF, and Canadians with AF are five times more likely to have 
      a stroke and are twice as likely to die than individuals without AF. AF and 
      stroke are more common among the elderly. Preventing thromboembolic events such 
      as stroke is an important part of managing AF patients. Antithrombotic strategies 
      for AF patients include anticoagulant drugs, notably the coumadin class of 
      vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, and antiplatelet agents, such as 
      aspirin. VKAs reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF by more than 60% when 
      compared with no treatment, and by 30% to 40% when compared with low-dose 
      aspirin. However, VKA use is associated with some drawbacks, including a need for 
      laboratory monitoring, an increased risk of bleeding complications, and several 
      food and drug interactions. An improved understanding of how the blood clotting 
      cascade works has led to the development of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) that 
      exhibit more predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, thereby obviating 
      the need for laboratory monitoring. The NOACs that have either been approved, or 
      are under review by regulators, for the prevention of thromboembolic events in AF 
      patients include dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, and the direct Factor 
      Xa (FXa) inhibitors, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Ximelagatran, a direct 
      thrombin inhibitor, was the first NOAC to be approved for use, but was withdrawn 
      from the market in 2006 because of safety concerns. While dabigatran, apixaban, 
      and rivaroxaban have been demonstrated to be effective in preventing 
      stroke/systemic embolism (SE) in AF patients, the relative effectiveness and 
      associated bleeding risks of these NOACs, both among themselves and in comparison 
      to warfarin, is not clear. Therefore, the aim of this project was to 
      systematically review and analyze the safety and effectiveness of three NOACs – 
      namely dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban – compared with warfarin in patients 
      with non-valvular AF. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of the NOACs and 
      warfarin was assessed using economic modelling.

AB  - Measuring direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) concentrations might be necessary in 
      certain clinical situations but is not routinely performed. The DOAC Dipstick is 
      a new rapid test for detecting DOACs in urine. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the possible uses and limitations of the DOAC Dipstick and to compare 
      visual analysis and DOASENSE Reader analysis of DOAC Dipstick pads. Plasma and 
      urine samples were collected from 23 patients taking DOACs. DOAC concentrations 
      in plasma and urine were measured by chromogenic substrate assays and in urine 
      also by the DOAC Dipstick. Plasma concentrations were dichotomized at a threshold 
      of ≥30 ng/mL. Patient samples were compared with samples from control individuals 
      not using anticoagulants (n = 10) and with DOASENSE control urines. The Combur-10 
      test was used to measure parameters that may affect urine color and hence the 
      interpretation of the DOAC Dipstick result. DOAC Dipstick test results were 
      positive in 21/23 patient urine samples at a plasma DOAC concentration of 
      ≥30 ng/mL and in 2/23 patient urine samples at a plasma DOAC concentration of 
      <30 ng/mL. Inter-observer agreement was above 90% for visual analysis of patient 
      urine samples and was 100% for DOASENSE Reader analysis of patient urines and for 
      analysis of control group urines and DOASENSE control urines. Abnormalities in 
      urine color detected by the Combur-10 test did not affect the DOAC Dipstick 
      results. DOAC Dipstick detects DOACs in urine at a plasma threshold of ≥30 ng/mL. 
      Positive DOAC Dipstick results should be confirmed by measuring DOAC plasma 
      concentration.

      indication for laboratory monitoring?
PG  - 756-65
LID - 10.1055/s-0034-1381233 [doi]
AB  - The recent development and marketing of novel direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      represents a paradigm shift in the management of patients requiring long-term 
      anticoagulation. The advantages of these compounds over traditional therapy with 
      vitamin K antagonists include a reportedly lower risk of severe hemorrhages and 
      the limited need for laboratory measurements. However, there are several 
      scenarios in which testing should be applied. The potential for drug-to-drug 
      interaction is one plausible but currently underrecognized indication for 
      laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant effect of DOACs. In particular, 
      substantial concern has been raised during Phase I studies regarding the 
      potential interaction of these drugs with some antibiotics, especially those that 
      interplay with permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome 3A4 (CYP3A4). A 
      specific electronic search on clinical trials published so far confirms that 
      clarithromycin and rifampicin significantly impair the bioavailability of 
      dabigatran, whereas clarithromycin, erythromycin, fluconazole, and ketoconazole 
      alter the metabolism of rivaroxaban in vivo. Because of their more recent 
      development, no published data were found for apixaban and edoxaban, or for 
      potential interactions of DOACs with other and widely used antibiotics. It is 
      noteworthy, however, that an online resource based on Food and Drug 
      Administration and social media information, reports several hemorrhagic and 
      thrombotic events in patients simultaneously taking dabigatran and some commonly 
      used antibiotics such as amoxicillin, cephalosporin, and metronidazole. According 
      to these reports, the administration of antibiotics in patients undergoing 
      therapy with DOACs would seem to require accurate evaluation as to whether dose 
      adjustments (personalized or antibiotic class driven) of the anticoagulant drug 
      may be advisable. This might be facilitated by direct laboratory assessments of 
      their anticoagulant effect ex vivo.

TI  - Apixaban versus edoxaban for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation.
PG  - 367-76
LID - 10.2217/cer.15.15 [doi]
AB  - Oral anticoagulation therapy is the mainstay of stroke prevention in nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation patients. Vitamin K antagonists (such as warfarin) have been 
      effective conventional oral anticoagulants for several decades. However, due to 
      their limitations in clinical use, several nonvitamin K antagonist oral 
      anticoagulants (NOACs, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) 
      have been developed. Nonetheless, no head to head trials have been performed to 
      directly compare these NOACs in patient cohorts. In this review article, two 
      direct factor Xa inhibitors, apixaban and edoxaban, are briefly described with 
      focus on their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, plus drug 
      interactions. Moreover, both efficacy and safety will be discussed based on the 
      available data from the large Phase III clinical trials and indirect comparison 
      studies.

TI  - Effects of the oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban on routine coagulation 
      assays, lupus anticoagulant and anti-Xa assays.
PG  - 575-583
LID - 10.1080/00365513.2018.1522664 [doi]
AB  - Edoxaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor for prophylaxis and treatment of 
      thromboembolic disorders. The effects on common coagulation assays are clinically 
      valuable information and in certain clinical situations a quick assessment of the 
      anticoagulant is wanted. Our aim was to investigate the effect of edoxaban on 
      routine coagulation methods and evaluate anti-Xa assays, commonly used for other 
      direct factor Xa inhibitors, for estimation of the drug concentration. Edoxaban 
      was spiked to plasma samples from healthy subjects in the concentration range 
      0-742 µg/L and analyzed using different reagents for activated partial 
      thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT). Assays for antithrombin, 
      activated protein C resistance, lupus anticoagulant (LA) and chromogenic anti-Xa 
      assays were also included. Edoxaban displayed similar effects in vitro to other 
      oral direct Xa inhibitors. The concentration needed to double the coagulation 
      time varied between assays and reagents; 539-758 µg/L for the APTT and between 
      329 and 2505 µg/L for the PT. Edoxaban gave false high antithrombin activities in 
      assays based on Xa-inhibition. Two integrated assays for LA, both based on 
      activation with dilute Russell's viper venom, displayed different results. 
      Chromogenic anti-Xa assays displayed linear dose-response curves with edoxaban up 
      to approximately 500 µg/L. In conclusion, therapeutic concentrations of edoxaban 
      variably affect different coagulation assays, and even different reagents within 
      an assay group. In comparison with other oral Xa-inhibitors, the in vitro effects 
      of edoxaban were more similar to rivaroxaban than apixaban. For measurement of 
      edoxaban concentration in plasma, it is possible to use the chromogenic anti-Xa 
      assays.

TI  - Laboratory Monitoring of Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs).
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines9050445 [doi]
LID - 445
AB  - The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban, provides safe and effective 
      alternative to previous anticoagulant therapies. DOACs directly, selectively, and 
      reversibly inhibit factors IIa or Xa. The coagulation effect follows the plasma 
      concentration-time profile of the respective anticoagulant. The short half-life 
      of a DOAC constrains the daily oral intake. Because DOACs have predictable 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses at a fixed dose, they do not 
      require monitoring. However in specific clinical situations and for particular 
      patient populations, testing may be helpful for patient management. The effect of 
      DOACs on the screening coagulation assays such as prothrombin time (PT), 
      activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and thrombin time (TT) is directly 
      linked to reagent composition, and clotting time can be different from reagent to 
      reagent, depending on the DOAC's reagent sensitivity. Liquid chromatography-mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is considered the gold standard method for DOAC 
      measurement, but it is time consuming and requires expensive equipment. The 
      general consensus for the assessment of a DOAC is clotting or chromogenic assays 
      using specific standard calibrators and controls. This review provides a short 
      summary of DOAC properties and an update on laboratory methods for measuring 
      DOACs.

TI  - New oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 155-65
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for stroke. Currently, 
      acetylsalicylic acid (a platelet inhibitor) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; oral 
      anticoagulants), including warfarin, are the only approved antithrombotic 
      therapies for stroke prevention in patients with AF. Although effective, VKAs 
      have unpredictable pharmacological effects, requiring regular coagulation 
      monitoring and dose adjustment to maintain effects within the therapeutic range. 
      The clinical development pathway for novel anticoagulants often involves 
      evaluation of efficacy and safety in a short-term indication, such as the 
      prevention of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE), followed by longer-term VTE 
      treatment studies, and finally chronic indications, including stroke prevention 
      studies in patients with AF. The coagulation pathway provides many targets for 
      novel anticoagulants, including Factor Xa (FXa) and Factor IIa (thrombin). 
      Numerous oral, direct FXa inhibitors are in various stages of clinical 
      development, including rivaroxaban, LY517717, YM150, DU-176b, apixaban, and 
      betrixaban, and are anticipated to overcome the limitations of VKAs. Dabigatran 
      is the only oral direct thrombin inhibitor in late-stage development. Studies of 
      these agents for stroke prevention in patients with AF are planned or ongoing. If 
      approved, they may represent the next generation of anticoagulants, by providing 
      new therapeutic options for stroke prevention in patients with AF.

AB  - With the recent approval of the fourth direct non vitamin K dependent oral 
      anticoagulant (NOAC) edoxaban the range of available NOACs for the treatment of 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) has expanded. Shortly thereafter, two updated 
      guidelines for the prevention and treatment of VTE have been published. In these 
      NOACs are listed as equal anticoagulants to low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), 
      or fondaparinux (FDX), and VKA for the initial or maintenance treatment of VTE. 
      All NOACs are approved for the maintenance therapy after VTE and two NOACs 
      (rivaroxaban and apixaban) for the initial treatment in addition in an increased 
      dose.NOACs differ in their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. In 
      patients with renal insufficiency the dose of all NOACs should be reduced 
      similarly to NMH/FDX. In contrast to VKAs, bridging with NOACs in case of 
      surgical interventions is generally dispensable. Similar to NMHs or FPX renal 
      function and individual bleeding risk dependent dose intermission is generally 
      sufficient. Conventional coagulation parameters like aPTT and INR are not 
      suitable for the monitoring of NOACs. Only in seldom cases, laboratory monitoring 
      with use of adjusted anti-Xa testing or diluted thrombin time (dabigatran) may be 
      helpful.

TI  - The perioperative management of treatment with anticoagulants and platelet 
      aggregation inhibitors.
PG  - 525-32
LID - 10.3238/arztebl.2013.0525 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: When giving anticoagulants and inhibitors of platelet aggregation 
      either prophylactically or therapeutically, physicians face the challenge of 
      protecting patients from thromboembolic events without inducing harmful bleeding. 
      Especially in the perioperative period, the use of these drugs requires a 
      carefully balanced evaluation of their risks and benefits. Moreover, the choice 
      of drug is difficult, because many different substances have been approved for 
      clinical use. METHOD: We selectively searched for relevant publications that 
      appeared from 2003 to February 2013, with particular consideration of the 
      guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology, the Association of Scientific 
      Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF), the American College of Cardiology, and the 
      American Heart Association. RESULTS: Vitamin K antagonists (VKA), low molecular 
      weight heparins, and fondaparinux are the established anticoagulants. The past 
      few years have seen the introduction of orally administered selective inhibitors 
      of the clotting factors IIa (dabigatran) and Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban). The 
      timing of perioperative interruption of anticoagulation is based on 
      pharmacokinetic considerations rather than on evidence from clinical trials. 
      Recent studies have shown that substituting short-acting anticoagulants for VKA 
      before a procedure increases the risk of bleeding without lowering the risk of 
      periprocedural thromboembolic events. The therapeutic spectrum of acetylsalicylic 
      acid and clopidogrel has been broadened by the newer platelet aggregation 
      inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor. Patients with drug eluting stents should be 
      treated with dual platelet inhibition for 12 months because of the risk of 
      in-stent thrombosis. CONCLUSION: Anticoagulants and platelet aggregation 
      inhibitors are commonly used drugs, but the evidence for their perioperative 
      management is limited. The risks of thrombosis and of hemorrhage must be balanced 
      against each other in the individual case. Anticoagulation need not be stopped 
      for minor procedures.

TI  - Management of venous thromboembolism in patients with advanced gastrointestinal 
      cancers: what is the role of novel oral anticoagulants?
PG  - 758385
LID - 758385
AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent complication of gastrointestinal 
      cancers that increases morbidity and may impact mortality. Low-molecular-weight 
      heparins (LMWHs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are standard anticoagulation 
      options for the ambulatory gastrointestinal cancer patient with VTE, but both of 
      these agents are challenging to use for various reasons. Novel oral 
      anticoagulants (NOAs) are new, orally available anticoagulants designed to be 
      easier to administer with more reliable pharmacokinetics that eliminate the need 
      for frequent monitoring of various laboratory parameters. This paper reviews the 
      existing efficacy and safety data for the use of NOAs dabigatran etexilate, 
      rivaroxaban, and apixaban and discusses the potential role of these agents in the 
      management of gastrointestinal cancer-related VTE.

AB  - Direct (New-generation) Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) have emerged as effective 
      agents which are used in place of vitamin-K antagonists in treatment and 
      prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE), atrial fibrillation and other 
      thrombotic diseases. Among them, the FIIa- direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran 
      and FXa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) are the most broadly used. 
      Anticoagulant dosing may differ under special considerations. The patients' 
      physiological reserves, organ functional status and failures should be taken into 
      account in clinical decision-making processes. The advantages and drawbacks of 
      each specific agent should be weighed with special regard to metabolism, 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, along with the efficiency of the agents in 
      different indications. This article aims to review the most recent literature to 
      highlight the usage and efficacy of the agents in different clinical conditions.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia encountered in 
      clinical practice. AF is a potent risk factor for stroke and systemic 
      thromboembolism. Patients with AF have been observed to have a worse outcome 
      following stroke, therefore prevention of stroke in patients with AF is of 
      paramount importance. Antithrombotic therapy is crucial for prevention of stroke 
      in patients with AF. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been the traditional 
      anticoagulants for prevention of stroke in patients with AF. Drug treatment with 
      VKAs is associated with significant management issues, such as an unpredictable 
      dose response necessitating dose adjustments, frequent laboratory monitoring and 
      multiple interactions with other drugs. Despite following best practices, VKAs 
      are associated with limited efficacy and increased risk of hemorrhage. Due to 
      these limitations a significant effort has been devoted towards development of 
      newer anticoagulants. Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, and more recently Apixaban have 
      been approved by the F.D.A. for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF. 
      These newer agents possess highly predictable pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamics properties which allow a fixed dosing regimen and also eliminate 
      the need of routine laboratory monitoring. This review discusses various 
      anticoagulants for prevention of stroke in patients with AF.

      thromboembolism in cancer patients.
PG  - 423-36
LID - 10.2147/TCRM.S49063 [doi]
AB  - Patients with cancer have a 6-7-fold higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
      as compared with non-cancer patients. Effective and safe anticoagulation for the 
      prevention and treatment of VTE is the cornerstone of the management of patients 
      with cancer, aiming to decrease morbidity and mortality and to improve quality of 
      life. Unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparins, fondaparinux and 
      vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are used in the prevention and treatment of VTE in 
      cancer patients. Heparins and fondaparinux are administered subcutaneously. VKAs 
      are orally active, but they have a narrow therapeutic window, numerous food and 
      drug interactions, and treatment requires regular laboratory monitoring and dose 
      adjustment. These limitations among others have important negative impact on the 
      quality of life of patients and decrease adherence to the treatment. New orally 
      active anticoagulant (NOAC) agents are specific inhibitors of activated factor Xa 
      (FXa) (rivaroxaban and apixaban) or thrombin (dabigatran). It is expected that 
      NOACs will improve antithrombotic treatment. Cancer patients are a particular 
      group that could benefit from treatment with NOACs. However, NOACs present some 
      significant interactions with drugs frequently used in cancer patients, which 
      might influence their pharmacokinetics, compromising their efficacy and safety. 
      In the present review, we analyzed the available data from the subgroups of 
      patients with active cancer who were included in Phase III clinical trials that 
      assessed the efficacy and safety of NOACs in the prevention and treatment of VTE. 
      The data from the Phase III trials in prophylaxis of VTE by rivaroxaban or 
      apixaban highlight that these two agents, although belonging to the same 
      pharmacological group (direct inhibitors of factor Xa), have substantially 
      different profiles of efficacy and safety, especially in hospitalized acutely ill 
      medical patients with active cancer. A limited number of patients with VTE and 
      active cancer were included in the Phase III trials (EINSTEIN, AMPLIFY, and 
      RE-COVER) which evaluated the efficacy and safety of NOACs in the acute phase and 
      secondary prevention of VTE. Although, from a conceptual point of view, NOACs 
      could be an attractive alternative for the treatment of VTE in cancer patients, 
      the available data do not support this option. In addition, due to the 
      elimination of the NOACs by the liver and renal pathway as well as because of 
      their pharmacological interactions with drugs which are frequently used in cancer 
      patients, an eventual use of these drugs in cancer patients should be extremely 
      cautious and be restricted only to patients presenting with contraindications for 
      low molecular weight heparins, fondaparinux, or VKAs. The analysis of the 
      available data presented in this review reinforces the request for the design of 
      new Phase III clinical trials for the assessment of the efficacy and safety of 
      NOACs in specific populations of patients with cancer.

TI  - Edoxaban: A direct oral anticoagulant.
PG  - 117-129
LID - 10.2146/ajhp150821 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, 
      safety, and place in therapy of edoxaban for prevention of stroke in patients 
      with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and treatment of venous thromboembolism 
      (VTE) are reviewed. SUMMARY: Although warfarin has been an established therapy 
      for stroke prevention in AF and VTE, the need for agents with less monitoring 
      requirements, fewer food and drug interactions, and a lower risk of major 
      bleeding led to the development of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Current 
      DOACs work by either directly blocking thrombin (dabigatran) or inhibiting factor 
      Xa (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban). Edoxaban is the newest DOAC and only 
      the second Food and Drug Administration-approved anticoagulant for once-daily 
      administration. Unlike apixaban and rivaroxaban, edoxaban does not interact with 
      the cytochrome P-450 system. The results of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 and Hokusai-VTE 
      trials demonstrated edoxaban's noninferiority to warfarin. However, the 
      adverse-effect profile of edoxaban may limit the drug's use in clinical practice; 
      in clinical trials, patients with AF who had a creatinine clearance of ≥95 mL/min 
      had a higher rate of strokes with the use of edoxaban versus warfarin. 
      CONCLUSION: A review of the literature showed that edoxaban, the most recently 
      approved DOAC, is noninferior to warfarin for management of VTE (after parenteral 
      anticoagulant therapy) and for stroke risk reduction in many patients with 
      nonvalvular AF.

AB  - For several decades vitamin K antagonists (VKA) were the standard for stroke 
      prevention in atrial fibrillation. Because of inconvenience associated with their 
      use (frequently VKA levels cannot be consistently maintained within the 
      therapeutic range, e.g. due to food and drug interactions, which necessitates 
      regular control of international normalized ratios) alternative compounds have 
      recently been developed, the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) dabigatran (a 
      direct antithrombin) as well as rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban (direct factor 
      Xa inhibitors). All these agents show a predictable pharmacokinetic profile 
      making routine laboratory controls unnecessary. Moreover, DOACs do not only show 
      a similar or even better efficacy, but also a more attractive safety profile in 
      terms of similar or less major bleeding complications, where all DOACs 
      significantly reduce the rate of intracranial bleeding when compared to VKAs. 
      This review summarizes the pharmacological characteristics and clinical study 
      results of DOACs that have been tested in phase 3 trials.

AB  - The use of direct oral anticoagulants over traditional warfarin has increased in 
      the United States over the past 10 years because of advantages such as ease of 
      use, predictable pharmacokinetic response, and safety. In 2015, the U.S. Food and 
      Drug Administration approved idarucizumab (Praxbind) for the reversal of the 
      direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, but no reversal agent has been available 
      for oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors until recently. Andexanet alfa was approved 
      in May 2018, under the brand name ANDEXXA, for the reversal of 2 of FXa 
      inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban, when life-threatening or uncontrolled 
      bleeding occurs. This accelerated approval was based on change in anti-FXa 
      activity from baseline that indicated a reversal of the anticoagulant effect. Any 
      expanded Food and Drug Administration indication will be contingent on results 
      demonstrating improved hemostasis and efficacy for reversing other FXa 
      inhibitors.

PG  - 6-16
AB  - Oral anticoagulant therapy is changing. In several clinical settings, warfarin 
      and acenocumarol remain the standard oral anticoagulants. However, in view of the 
      limitations of vitamin K antagonists, resulting from its slow onset of 
      pharmacological action, its narrow therapeutic window, its variable metabolism, 
      dependent of citochrome P450, its multiple pharmacological and food interactions 
      and its potential risk for hemorrhagic complications, the last years have 
      witnessed the emergence of new pharmacological groups in oral anticoagulant 
      therapy, that can overcome these problems. At present, pharmacological 
      investigation is focused in the development of new non-peptide molecules, which 
      can inhibit essential moments of the coagulation system (thrombin and factor Xa), 
      with a predictable and consistent pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic pattern, 
      administered orally. Of these compounds, three of them (dabigatran, rivaroxaban 
      and apixaban) already have defined (or to be defined) therapeutic indications, 
      built on large interventional phase III studies, while many others are in less 
      advanced development phases. This review summarizes and discusses the 
      pharmacology of warfarin/acenocumarol and of the new direct thrombin and factor 
      Xa inhibitors, exemplifying similarities and stressing differences that help us 
      justify out therapeutic options.

TI  - Differential benefit risk assessment of DOACs in the treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism: focus on dabigatran.
PG  - 3557-69
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S70299 [doi]
AB  - Venous thromboembolism includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and 
      is a serious medical condition that requires anticoagulation as part of 
      treatment. Currently, standard therapy consists of parenteral anticoagulation 
      followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      profiles of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) differ from VKAs, which 
      overcome some of the limitations of VKAs and have practical implications on their 
      use in clinical situations. Dabigatran is a prodrug that undergoes primarily 
      renal elimination and does not affect cytochrome P450 enzymes. Assays to quantify 
      the degree of anticoagulation and the therapeutic level of DOAC are either 
      unavailable for routine clinical use or require specific calibration. Routine 
      monitoring of DOACs is not recommended at this time. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and 
      apixaban are DOACs that have been studied for treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism. Clinical trials comparing DOACs with standard therapy have shown 
      them to be non-inferior for acute and extended therapy. Each DOAC has a unique 
      benefit and harm profile that should be considered prior to use. The 
      distinguishing characteristics of dabigatran include a requirement of parenteral 
      anticoagulation prior to acute treatment, clinical trial results comparing it 
      with a VKA for extended treatment, association with upper gastrointestinal 
      adverse events, and increased risk of gastrointestinal bleed. Rivaroxaban is the 
      only DOAC that has once-daily dosing while apixaban is the only DOAC that has 
      lower risk of overall, major, and gastrointestinal bleeding compared with VKA. A 
      common drawback of DOACs is the lack of an available reversal agent. Clinical 
      trials of reversal agents are ongoing and one application for approval has been 
      submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration. Selection of a DOAC for acute 
      and extended therapy requires a shared decision-making approach that includes a 
      comprehensive assessment of the benefits and harms of each individual DOAC.

TI  - New oral anticoagulants: comparative pharmacology with vitamin K antagonists.
PG  - 69-82
LID - 10.1007/s40262-012-0030-9 [doi]
AB  - New oral anticoagulants (OACs) that directly inhibit Factor Xa (FXa) or thrombin 
      have been developed for the long-term prevention of thromboembolic disorders. 
      These novel agents provide numerous benefits over older vitamin K antagonists 
      (VKAs) due to major pharmacological differences. VKAs are economical and very 
      well characterized, but have important limitations that can outweigh these 
      advantages, such as slow onset of action, narrow therapeutic window and 
      unpredictable anticoagulant effect. VKA-associated dietary precautions, 
      monitoring and dosing adjustments to maintain international normalized ratio 
      (INR) within therapeutic range, and bridging therapy, are inconvenient for 
      patients, expensive, and may result in inappropriate use of VKA therapy. This may 
      lead to increased bleeding risk or reduced anticoagulation and increased risk of 
      thrombotic events. The new OACs have rapid onset of action, low potential for 
      food and drug interactions, and predictable anticoagulant effect that removes the 
      need for routine monitoring. FXa inhibitors, e.g. rivaroxaban and apixaban, are 
      potent, oral direct inhibitors of prothrombinase-bound, clot-associated or free 
      FXa. Both agents have a rapid onset of action, a wide therapeutic window, little 
      or no interaction with food and other drugs, minimal inter-patient variability, 
      and display similar pharmacokinetics in different patient populations. Since both 
      are substrates, co-administration of rivaroxaban and apixaban with strong 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors and 
      inducers can result in substantial changes in plasma concentrations due to 
      altered clearance rates; consequently, their concomitant use is contraindicated 
      and caution is required when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 and P-gp 
      inducers. Although parenteral oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs), such as 
      argatroban and bivalirudin, have been on the market for years, DTIs such as 
      dabigatran are novel synthetic thrombin antagonists. Dabigatran etexilate is a 
      low-molecular-weight non-active pro-drug that is administered orally and 
      converted rapidly to its active form, dabigatran--a potent, competitive and 
      reversible DTI. Dabigatran has an advantage over the indirect thrombin 
      inhibitors, unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, in that it 
      inhibits free and fibrin-bound thrombin. The reversible binding of dabigatran may 
      provide safer and more predictable anticoagulant treatment than seen with 
      irreversible, non-covalent thrombin inhibitors, e.g. hirudin. Dabigatran shows a 
      very low potential for drug-drug interactions. However, co-administration of 
      dabigatran etexilate with other anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents can 
      increase the bleeding risk. Although the new agents are pharmacologically better 
      than VKAs--particularly in terms of fixed dosing, rapid onset of action, no INR 
      monitoring and lower risk of drug interactions--there are some differences 
      between them: the bioavailability of dabigatran is lower than rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban, and so the dabigatran dosage required is higher; lower protein binding 
      of dabigatran reduces the variability related to albuminaemia. The risk of 
      metabolic drug-drug interactions also appears to differ between OACs: VKAs > 
      rivaroxaban > apixaban > dabigatran. The convenience of the new OACs has 
      translated into improvements in efficacy and safety as shown in phase III 
      randomized trials. The new anticoagulants so far offer the greatest promise and 
      opportunity for the replacement of VKAs.

TI  - Interactions Between Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) and Antiseizure 
      Medications: Potential Implications on DOAC Treatment.
PG  - 203-214
LID - 10.1007/s40263-023-00990-0 [doi]
AB  - The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is increasing because of their 
      superior efficacy and safety compared with vitamin K antagonists. Pharmacokinetic 
      drug interactions, particularly those involving cytochrome P450- mediated 
      metabolism and P-glycoprotein transport, significantly affect the efficacy and 
      safety of DOACs. In this article, we assess the effects of cytochrome P450- and 
      P-glycoprotein-inducing antiseizure medications on DOAC pharmacokinetics in 
      comparison to rifampicin. Rifampicin decreases to a varying extent the plasma 
      exposure (area under the concentration-time curve) and peak concentration of each 
      DOAC, consistent with its specific absorption and elimination pathways. For 
      apixaban and rivaroxaban, rifampicin had a greater effect on the area under the 
      concentration-time curve than on peak concentration. Therefore, using peak 
      concentration to monitor DOAC concentrations may underestimate the effect of 
      rifampicin on DOAC exposure. Antiseizure medications that are cytochrome P450 and 
      P-glycoprotein inducers are commonly used with DOACs. Several studies have 
      observed a correlation between the concomitant use of DOACs and enzyme-inducing 
      antiseizure medications and DOAC treatment failure, for example, ischemic and 
      thrombotic events. The European Society of Cardiology recommends avoiding this 
      combination, as well as the combination of DOACs with levetiracetam and valproic 
      acid, owing to a risk of low DOAC concentrations. However, levetiracetam and 
      valproic acid are not cytochrome P450 or P-glycoprotein inducers, and the 
      implications of their use with DOACs remain to be elucidated. Our comparative 
      analysis suggests DOAC plasma concentration monitoring as a possible strategy to 
      guide dosing owing to the predictable correlation between DOACs' plasma 
      concentration and effect. Patients taking concomitant enzyme-inducing antiseizure 
      medications are at risk for low DOAC concentrations and subsequently, treatment 
      failure and thus can benefit from DOAC concentration monitoring to 
      prophylactically identify this risk.

TI  - Direct Oral FXa Inhibitors Binding to Human Serum Albumin: Spectroscopic, 
      Calorimetric, and Computational Studies.

AB  - Direct FXa inhibitors are an important class of bioactive molecules (rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban) applied for thromboprophylaxis in diverse 
      cardiovascular pathologies. The interaction of active compounds with human serum 
      albumin (HSA), the most abundant protein in blood plasma, is a key research area 
      and provides crucial information about drugs' pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamic properties. This research focuses on the study of the 
      interactions between HSA and four commercially available direct oral FXa 
      inhibitors, applying methodologies including steady-state and time-resolved 
      fluorescence, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and molecular dynamics. The 
      HSA complexation of FXa inhibitors was found to occur via static quenching, and 
      the complex formation in the ground states affects the fluorescence of HSA, with 
      a moderate binding constant of 10(4) M(-1). However, the ITC studies reported 
      significantly different binding constants (10(3) M(-1)) compared with the results 
      obtained through spectrophotometric methods. The suspected binding mode is 
      supported by molecular dynamics simulations, where the predominant interactions 
      were hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (mainly π-π stacking 
      interactions between the phenyl ring of FXa inhibitors and the indole moiety of 
      Trp214). Finally, the possible implications of the obtained results regarding 
      pathologies such as hypoalbuminemia are briefly discussed.

AB  - In contrast to older anticoagulant agents vitamin K antagonists and heparins, the 
      new ones are directed towards a single target in general. The main 
      characteristics of the new agents are: their site of action in the coagulation 
      cascade and their mechanism of action which is indirect, antithrombin dependent, 
      most often such as Fondaparinux and Idraparinux or direct such as Dabigatran, 
      Rivaroxaban; the specificity of the new molecules, since they must not interact 
      with other enzymes: trypsin, kallikrein, t-PA, etc...; their mode of 
      administration parenteral and/or oral; their pharmacokinetics and their clearance 
      frequently by the kidney (Hirudin, fondaparinux) or through hepatic metabolism 
      (argatroban); tolerance including for all compounds the bleeding risk or an 
      unexpected hepatic intolerance for Ximelagatran; the availability of a specific 
      antidote and the cost of the drug; one compound is registered in France Arixtra 
      Fondaparinux in major orthopedic surgery and in the treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism and in prophylactic treatment in medical patients. However, the 
      main indications of interest for these new drugs is atrial fibrillation. There is 
      a real need in this indication and the number of patients to treat is growing 
      with the longer life expectancy.

TI  - New Oral Anticoagulants in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 739-746
LID - 10.1002/clc.22582 [doi]
AB  - The choice of an oral anticoagulant (OAC) for patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF) is a major and complex clinical decision taking into account 
      the individual risk-benefit ratio and bearing in mind the chronicity of therapy. 
      This review focuses on the safety and efficacy of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) 
      compared with conventional vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in patients with NVAF. 
      Current data suggest that NOACs are at least as effective and safe as VKAs for 
      most NVAF subjects. The NOACs do not mandate dietary restrictions and regular 
      pharmacodynamic monitoring, and they seem to have lesser incidence of 
      intracranial or fatal bleeding when compared with VKAs. However, both dabigatran 
      150 twice daily and rivaroxaban have a slightly higher incidence of 
      gastrointestinal bleeding when compared with VKAs. The article will delineate the 
      current knowledge as well as scientific gaps related to the choice and dosage of 
      anticoagulation regimens for various NVAF subsets and will address certain common 
      clinical scenarios requiring special considerations. The article also addresses 
      the shortcomings of NOACs: lack of therapeutic pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic targets, absence of tools to assess compliance and efficacy, 
      rigid and limited dosage options, and absence of effective and inexpensive 
      reversal agents.

AB  - The availability of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) targeting either thrombin 
      (dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban and apixaban) for the prevention 
      and treatment of thrombosis has been highly anticipated. NOACs have major 
      pharmacologic advantages over vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin), including 
      rapid onset/offset of action, few drug interactions, and predictable 
      pharmacokinetics, eliminating the requirement for regular coagulation monitoring. 
      Regulatory agencies have approved several NOACs for specific indications based on 
      the results of clinical trials demonstrating efficacy and safety that are at 
      least as good, if not better, than warfarin (for stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation and treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism) or 
      low-molecular-weight heparin, which is injectable (for initial treatment of 
      venous thromboembolism and thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing hip or knee 
      arthroplasty). However, the adoption of this new therapeutic class into clinical 
      practice has been slower than expected due to several factors including concerns 
      regarding medication adherence without laboratory monitoring, uncertainty about 
      dosing in some patient populations (eg, renal dysfunction, marked extremes of 
      body weight), and higher drug costs compared with warfarin. Other issues are the 
      current absence of specific antidotes for NOACs and assays to measure drug levels 
      at most centers. The indications for NOACs on the market will expand and at least 
      one additional agent (edoxaban) will likely gain approval within the next 2 
      years. As practitioners gain familiarity with the drugs and healthcare systems 
      adapt to their use, NOAC use will increase substantially over time. Warfarin, 
      however, will continue to be an appropriate anticoagulant choice for many 
      patients.

TI  - The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and extremes of body 
      weight-a systematic literature review.
PG  - 565-572
LID - 10.1007/s00392-017-1102-5 [doi]
AB  - The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) exert their 
      anticoagulant effect closely related to their plasma concentrations. Since their 
      distribution volume is related to body weight (and its correlates, i.e., surface 
      area and body mass index, BMI), extremes in body weight may affect their efficacy 
      or safety. Four NOACs are currently available for long-term use, with few 
      exceptions, in atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism: the direct 
      thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate, and the factor (F) Xa inhibitors 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Experience in patients with low (<50 kg) or 
      extremely high (>150 kg) body weight is still quite limited, as such patients 
      were rare in registration trials and sometimes directly excluded. In general, 
      increased bleeding and higher mortality rates are observed in patients 
      weighing <50 kg compared with patients weighing 50-100 kg. This may however also 
      be explained by the presence of underlying conditions such as cancer. At the 
      opposite end of the spectrum of body weight, lower antithrombotic efficacy may 
      occur, perhaps due to the dilutional effect of a higher distribution volume. In 
      this article, we review the pertinent literature and analyze the effects of low 
      or high body weight on anticoagulant activity and clinical outcomes of the NOACs, 
      their dose recommendations, and areas of uncertainty.

TI  - Implementing the new oral anticoagulants into the hospital formulary.
PG  - S127-32
LID - 10.1002/ajh.23208 [doi]
AB  - The new oral anticoagulants may prove to be one of most significant innovations 
      in clinical practice in the past 60 years. Apixaban and rivaroxaban are direct 
      inhibitors of Factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits Factor IIa. The predictable 
      pharmacological profile of these new agents allows physicians to prescribe these 
      drugs without the need for routine coagulation monitoring, which is the mainstay 
      of warfarin therapy. In addition, these new agents have not been shown to have 
      any food interactions and minimal drug-drug interactions, interactions are 
      limited to the p-glycoprotein (p-Gp) transporter or cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 
      system, each drug is unique in its drug interaction profile, as will be discussed 
      below. These unique pharmacokinetics profiles may usher in for clinicians a new 
      era of managing thromboembolic disorders. In this article, the pharmacology of 
      these new oral anticoagulants will be reviewed along with the major clinical 
      trials evaluating the use of these agents for thromboembolic prophylaxis in 
      patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplastic surgery, the treatment of 
      venous thromboembolic disorders and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Am.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a more manageable alternative than vitamin 
      K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation and to prevent and treat venous thromboembolism. Despite their 
      widespread use in clinical practice, there are still some unresolved issues on 
      optimizing their use in particular clinical settings. Herein, we reviewed the 
      current clinical evidence on uses of DOACs from pharmacology and clinical 
      indications to safety and practical issues such as drugs and food interactions. 
      Dabigatran is the DOAC most affected by interactions with drugs and food, 
      although all DOACs demonstrate a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Management 
      issues associated with perioperative procedures, bleeding treatment, and special 
      populations (pregnancy, renal and hepatic impairment, elderly, and oncologic 
      patients) have been discussed. Literature evidence shows that DOACs are at least 
      as effective as VKAs, with a favorable safety profile; data are particularly 
      encouraging in using low doses of edoxaban in elderly patients, and edoxaban and 
      rivaroxaban in the treatment of venous thromboembolism in oncologic patients. In 
      the next year, DOAC clinical indications are likely to be further extended.

AB  - Oral anticoagulants and platelet receptor blockers are widely used in clinical 
      practice with the aim of reducing the risk of thrombotic complications in 
      patients with cardiovascular diseases. Their regular intake and adequate 
      antithrombotic action is vital and this is way numerous assays have been 
      developed for laboratory testing and monitoring of these agents. Available assays 
      can be stratified into pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assays. Such assays 
      are increasingly used in clinical routine and their daily use is triggered by the 
      advent of the novel direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as an alternative for 
      vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment, which are dabigatran, rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban, and by the advent of prasugrel or ticagrelor as an alternative for 
      clopidogrel with regard to platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibition. In this review the 
      most important and most commonly used laboratory assays are summarized as well as 
      their clinical implications with the focus on DOACs as an alternative for VKAs 
      and the different P2Y12 receptor blockers for antiplatelet treatment.

AB  - Apixaban is a direct oral Xa inhibitor and is indicated for the treatment of 
      venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) and prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation 
      (AF). Recently, a generic (ZyQuis, Zydus Lifesciences Limited, India) has 
      received Food and Drug Administration approval. While bioequivalence has been 
      demonstrated with Eliquis (Bristol-Myers Squibb/Pfizer, UK), it is necessary to 
      monitor its effectiveness prior to acceptance in medical practice. This 
      prospective study independently evaluated Apixaban (ZyQuis) at two accredited 
      laboratories. Participants were converted from Warfarin or Rivaroxaban to 
      Apixaban 5 mg bd for a duration of one month. Peak anti-Xa levels were measured 
      3-4 h post the morning dose. The samples were processed on the Atellica COAG 360 
      (Siemens Healthineers, Marburg, Germany) analyzers with a chromogenic anti-Xa 
      assay (Innovance, reference interval 69-321 ng/mL). There were 26 participants; 5 
      men, 21 women; mean ± standard deviation age of 46 ± 12 years. Indications for 
      anticoagulation included: VTE (88.5%) and AF (11.5%). 69.2% of the participants 
      had at least one comorbidity. 96.2% of the anti-Xa levels were within the 
      laboratory's 95% reference interval. Mean anti-Xa activity was 191 ± 69 ng/mL and 
      186 ± 68 ng/mL measured at respective laboratories. Mean differences in anti-Xa 
      measurements represented by Bland-Altman statistics were small (bias of -2.6%, 
      95% confidence interval -1.11 to -4.09) and a strong correlation was observed on 
      Deming regression analysis (0.995). Apixaban (ZyQuis) was effective for the 
      management of VTE and AF as evidenced by anti-Xa activity.

TI  - Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Obesity and Atrial Fibrillation: 
      Position Paper of Italian National Association of Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO).
LID - 10.3390/jcm10184185 [doi]
LID - 4185
AB  - The use of the direct oral anticoagulants dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and 
      edoxaban (DOACs) offers some major advantages over warfarin and other vitamin K 
      antagonists (VKAs). One advantage is the possibility to use a fixed dose in 
      normal-weight patients, overweight patients and patients with obesity. However, 
      the "one size fits all" strategy raised a concern regarding the possibility to 
      undertreat patients with a high body mass index. No randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) have ever compared VKAs and DOACs in this population. We analyzed data 
      from the literature on DOAC pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, results from 
      the four pivotal phase III trials on non-valvular atrial fibrillation, 
      retrospective observational studies and metanalyses. While we are aware of the 
      limitation imposed by the absence of specific RCTs, we propose the position of 
      the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO) on the use of DOACs in 
      patients with obesity based on the existing evidence.

      of the PBPK Absorption Model in Food Effect Studies of Weakly Basic 
      Water-Insoluble Compounds in Immediate Release Formulations.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics16101324 [doi]
LID - 1324
AB  - Background/Objectives: Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) absorption 
      models are instrumental for assessing drug absorption prior to clinical food 
      effect studies, though discrepancies in predictive and actual outcomes are 
      observed. This study focused on immediate release formulations of weakly basic 
      water-insoluble compounds, namely rivaroxaban, ticagrelor, and PB-201, to 
      investigate factors that could improve the predictive accuracy of PBPK models 
      regarding food effects. Methods: Comprehensive in vitro experimental results 
      provided the basis for the development of mechanistic absorption models, which 
      were then combined with mechanistic disposition models to predict the systemic 
      exposure of the model drugs in both fasted and fed states. Results: The developed 
      PBPK models showed moderate to high predictive accuracy for food effects in 
      Caucasian populations. For the Chinese population, the ticagrelor model's initial 
      overestimation of fed-state absorption was addressed by updating the permeability 
      parameters from Caco-2 cell assays to those derived from parallel artificial 
      membrane permeability assays in FaSSIF and FeSSIF media. This refinement was also 
      applied to the rivaroxaban and ticagrelor models, leading to a more accurate 
      representation of absorption in Caucasians. Conclusions: This study highlights 
      the importance of apparent permeability in enhancing the predictive accuracy of 
      PBPK absorption models for weakly basic water-insoluble compounds. Furthermore, 
      the precipitation of PB-201 in the two-stage transfer experiments suggests that 
      precipitation may not be a universal phenomenon for such compounds in vivo. 
      Consequently, the precipitation rate constant, a theoretically essential 
      parameter, should be determined based on experimental evidence to avoid 
      overparameterization and ensure robust predictive accuracy of PBPK models.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). It is associated with an increased risk of stroke, which increases 
      as kidney function declines. In the general population and in those with a 
      moderate degree of CKD (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min), the use of oral 
      anticoagulation to decrease the risk of stroke has been the standard of care 
      based on a favorable risk-benefit profile that had been established in seminal 
      randomized controlled trials. However, evidence regarding the use of oral 
      anticoagulants for stroke prevention is less clear in patients with severe CKD 
      (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) and those receiving maintenance dialysis, as 
      these individuals were excluded from such large randomized controlled trials. 
      Nevertheless, the direct oral anticoagulants have invariably usurped vitamin K 
      antagonists as the preferred choice for oral anticoagulation among patients with 
      AF across all strata of CKD based on their well-defined safety and efficacy and 
      multiple pharmacokinetic benefits (e.g., less drug-drug interactions). This 
      review summarizes the current literature on the role of oral anticoagulation in 
      the management of AF among patients with CKD and highlights current deficiencies 
      in the evidence base and how to overcome them.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Geriatric patients who sustain hip fractures and are taking factor Xa 
      inhibitors (Xa-I) experience surgical delay. Our institution developed a 
      pharmacokinetic protocol to formally guide and expedite surgical timing for these 
      patients. The protocol is based on the patient's renal function and timing of 
      last Xa-I dose. For patients with impaired renal function, longer wait times are 
      recommended. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of this 
      protocol for patients with geriatric hip fracture taking Xa-I. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Level 1 trauma center. 
      PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 164 patients aged 65 and older who were taking 
      Xa-I before admission and underwent hip fracture surgery; 68 patients in the 
      Standard group (2014-2018) and 96 patients in the Expedited group (2020-2022, 
      after protocol implementation). INTERVENTION: Hip fracture surgery. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASUREMENTS: Time to surgery (TTS), transfusion rate, blood loss, 90-day 
      complication rates. RESULTS: The median TTS was significantly shorter in the 
      Expedited group (28.6 hours, interquartile range 21.3 hours) than in the Standard 
      group (44.8 hours, interquartile range 21.1 hours) (P < .001). There were no 
      differences in overall transfusion rates. Multivariable regression analysis 
      demonstrated that time to surgery was not predictive of transfusion rate in all 
      patients (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.02, P = .652). There were no differences in 
      blood loss or rates of 90-day complications. CONCLUSION: Geriatric patients with 
      hip fractures and taking factor Xa inhibitors may warrant earlier surgery without 
      an increased risk of transfusion or bleeding. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic 
      Level III.

TI  - Direct oral anticoagulants in chronic kidney disease: an update.
PG  - 489-496
LID - 10.1097/MNH.0000000000000634 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are variably eliminated by 
      the kidneys rendering their use potentially problematic in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) or necessitating appropriate dose adjustment. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Both observational and limited randomized trial data for DOACs compared 
      with no treatment or with warfarin for patients with atrial fibrillation on 
      maintenance dialysis were recently published. In a randomized trial in patients 
      on hemodialysis, there was no significant difference in vascular calcification 
      between patients who received rivaroxaban with or without vitamin K2 or vitamin K 
      antagonists. A randomized trial of apixaban versus warfarin was terminated owing 
      to poor enrollment and preliminary results identified no difference in clinical 
      outcomes between groups. However, valuable pharmacodynamic data will be 
      forthcoming from that trial. In observational research, among patients newly 
      diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, there were opposing trends in the 
      associations of apixaban initiation versus no oral anticoagulation with ischemic 
      versus hemorrhagic stroke and no association was present with the overall risk of 
      stroke or embolism. In another study comparing apixaban with warfarin initiation, 
      apixaban was associated with less bleeding. Regular-dose apixaban (5 mg twice 
      daily) associated with reduced rates of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, 
      whereas no such association was present for those prescribed the reduced dose 
      (2.5 mg twice daily). SUMMARY: DOACs may be used after appropriate dose 
      adjustment for an established clinical indication in patients with advanced CKD. 
      Quality evidence for oral anticoagulation, with any specific agent or dose, for 
      stroke prevention in hemodialysis continues to be lacking.

TI  - The Use of Edoxaban in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and Venous 
      Thromboembolism: A Pharmacist's Perspective.
PG  - 26-34
LID - 10.1310/hpj5101-26 [doi]
AB  - Until 2010, the vitamin K antagonist warfarin was the only available oral 
      anticoagulant for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolic events (SEE) in 
      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and the treatment of venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) in the United States. Despite its proven efficacy, the use 
      of warfarin is limited by numerous disadvantages, including a delayed onset of 
      action and variable efficacy resulting from interactions with genetic and 
      environmental factors. Consequently, optimal anticoagulation with warfarin 
      requires dose adjustments based on frequent monitoring. In contrast to warfarin, 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      and edoxaban have predictable pharmacokinetic profiles, few drug-drug 
      interactions, no known interactions with food, and can be administered at fixed 
      doses without the requirement for routine monitoring. All DOACs have received US 
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the prevention of stroke or SEE 
      in patients with NVAF and the treatment of VTE based on phase 3 trials 
      demonstrating that they are at least as efficacious as warfarin. In addition, the 
      incidence of clinically relevant bleeding associated with DOACs is comparable to 
      or lower than with warfarin. In this article, the preclinical and clinical data 
      that led to the FDA approval of once-daily edoxaban in January 2015 are 
      presented. Furthermore, practical considerations for edoxaban use including 
      dosing recommendations, transitions of care, reversal of anticoagulation, 
      precautions, contraindications, and cost-effectiveness are discussed. Edoxaban is 
      an important addition to oral anticoagulation options available for the 
      therapeutic management of patients with NVAF or VTE.

AB  - Current practice guidelines recommend oral anticoagulant therapy for most 
      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with more than a low risk of 
      stroke. Although warfarin is very effective and the risk of major bleeding is 
      acceptable, the use of the drug is challenging for patients and physicians. The 3 
      novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, have 
      been shown to be either noninferior or superior to warfarin for the prevention of 
      stroke and/or systemic embolism and their rates of major bleeding are no greater 
      than warfarin. They are much easier for patients to use and for physicians to 
      manage. Except for certain situations in which the NOACs have not been evaluated 
      or some feature of warfarin is preferable, clinical guidelines generally 
      recommend a preference for a NOAC over warfarin when oral anticoagulation is 
      indicated. Although the NOACs have many similarities in their advantageous 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, there are a number of 
      difference between them with regard to particular patient characteristics (eg, 
      age ≥ 75 years, renal dysfunction, coronary artery disease, venous 
      thromboembolism, risk of bleeding, prior stroke and/or transient ischemic attack, 
      side effects, dose regimens, and cost-effectiveness). These differences are 
      outlined and discussed in terms of their potential relevance in deciding among 
      the 3 available NOACs for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common significant cardiac rhythm disorder, 
      and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. Atrial fibrillation confers a 
      fivefold increased risk of stroke, and these strokes are associated with 
      significant mortality and disability. The vitamin K antagonist, warfarin, has 
      been the mainstay of anticoagulant therapy for patients with AF, reducing the 
      risk of stroke by 65%. Despite its efficacy, warfarin remains underused in 
      clinical practice because of its variable dose response, diet and medication 
      interactions, and need for frequent monitoring. Stroke prevention in AF has 
      entered an exciting therapeutic era with new classes of targeted anticoagulants 
      that avoid the many pitfalls of the vitamin K antagonists. Dabigatran, an oral 
      thrombin inhibitor, and the factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, have 
      demonstrated efficacy for stroke prevention and a reduced risk of intracranial 
      hemorrhage relative to warfarin. Translating the efficacy of clinical trials into 
      effective use of these novel agents in clinical practice will require an 
      understanding of their pharmacokinetic profiles, dose selection, and management 
      in select clinical situations.

TI  - Emerging anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism prevention.
PG  - S17-25
LID - 10.2146/ajhp100178 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To discuss the advantages and disadvantages of currently available 
      anticoagulants, describe the characteristics of the ideal anticoagulant, and 
      compare and contrast the mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, administration, 
      efficacy, safety, and potential for drug interactions of currently available and 
      emerging anticoagulants for prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). SUMMARY: 
      Despite the proven efficacy of currently available agents for VTE prevention, 
      several shortcomings exist that may prevent their use under various 
      circumstances. These include administration by injection, narrow therapeutic 
      index, unpredictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, need for laboratory 
      monitoring, risk for bleeding, and drug interactions. The ideal anticoagulant 
      would overcome many of these issues; in particular, it would be available as an 
      oral formulation. Dabigatran, an oral direct thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitor, and 
      apixaban and rivaroxaban, oral direct factor Xa inhibitors, represent new agents 
      for anticoagulation that may address many of these issues. While not available as 
      an oral agent, desirudin is an additional option and offers increased flexibility 
      when a non-heparin-based injectable anticoagulant is desired. Current literature 
      indicates that these agents generally do not require laboratory monitoring and 
      are safe and effective for VTE prevention in clinical studies of patients 
      undergoing major orthopedic surgery. CONCLUSION: The development of new 
      anticoagulants that may overcome limitations of existing agents represents an 
      opportunity to further improve outcomes in patients at risk for VTE in orthopedic 
      surgery.

AB  - Options for anticoagulation have been expanding constantly during the past few 
      years, providing a greater number of agents for prevention and management of 
      thromboembolic disease. Although heparins and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) has 
      been used extensively for many decades, their narrow therapeutic range, 
      interactions with other medications and food, and the need for routine monitoring 
      of blood levels have led to the search for less problematic alternatives. Direct 
      oral anticoagulants represent an important advance in anticoagulation therapy, 
      directly inhibiting thrombin (dabigatran) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban) 
      they represent an effective and safe alternatives to VKAs and heparins in the 
      prevention and treatment of several thromboembolic disorders. DOCAs are 
      associated with a low overall intracranial hemorrhage risk; however, 
      life-threatening bleeding can occur. Reversal agents are approved for some and 
      under development for others, concerns over the lack of antidotes or difficulty 
      in obtaining them has tempered enthusiasm for their use because of the perception 
      of better safety with heparins and VKAs as a result of the availability of 
      effective reversal strategies. Appropriate use of these agents requires knowledge 
      of their individual characteristics, mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, ways 
      of monitoring, and when needed, manage patients in need of urgent surgery 
      especially in life-threatening bleeds. This article provides a suggested 
      comprehensive approach to manage patients with intracranial hemorrhage while on 
      direct oral anticoagulants who require an urgent surgical intervention and who 
      cannot wait for plasma concentration to decline.

AB  - Traditional anticoagulant agents such as vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), 
      unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and 
      fondaparinux have been widely used in the prevention and treatment of 
      thromboembolic diseases. However, these agents are associated with limitations, 
      such as the need for regular coagulation monitoring (VKAs and UFH) or a 
      parenteral route of administration (UFH, LMWHs and fondaparinux). Several non-VKA 
      oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are now widely used in the prevention and treatment 
      of thromboembolic diseases and in stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial 
      fibrillation. Unlike VKAs, NOACs exhibit predictable pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics. They are therefore usually given at fixed doses without routine 
      coagulation monitoring. However, in certain patient populations or special 
      clinical circumstances, measurement of drug exposure may be useful, such as in 
      suspected overdose, in patients experiencing a hemorrhagic or thromboembolic 
      event during the treatment's period, in those with acute renal failure, in 
      patients who require urgent surgery or in case of an invasive procedure. This 
      article aims at providing guidance on laboratory testing of classic 
      anticoagulants and NOACs.

      Study.
PG  - 522-529
LID - 10.1093/chromsci/bmac076 [doi]
AB  - A simple, sensitive and accurate LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for 
      the simultaneous quantification of apixaban (APB) and metformin (MET) in rat 
      plasma using rivaroxaban as internal standard (IS). An Inertsil ODS3 C18 column 
      (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) was used for chromatographic separation with isocratic 
      elution. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using positive-ion ESI mode to 
      monitor ion transitions of m/z 459.8 → 442.8 for APB, m/z 130.2 → 71.2 for MET, 
      m/z 436.8 → 144.9 for IS. The procedure of method validation included 
      selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect, extraction recovery 
      and stability were conducted according to the guidelines of EMA and FDA. The 
      method was validated over the concentration range of 0.5-250 ng/mL for APB and 
      8-8000 ng/mL for MET. The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy of the 
      quality control samples exhibited relative standard deviations (RSD) < 12.5% and 
      the accuracy values ranged from -8.6 to 12.4%. Recovery and matrix effect values 
      variations were all less than 15%. After oral administration APB and MET to rats, 
      the comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters of APB in the single and 
      co-administrated groups showed significant difference in AUC(0-t) from 
      730.71 ± 121.31 to 573.07 ± 90.13 ng/mL·h, t1/2 from 5.86 ± 3.21 to 4.24 ± 1.15 h 
      and Cmax from113.54 ± 24.04 to 159.42 ± 54.6 ng/mL. The comparison of 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of MET in the single and co-administrated groups 
      showed significant difference in t1/2 from 2.83 ± 1.81 to 3.97 ± 0.57 h and Cmax 
      from 4015.76 ± 873.23 to 3153.6 ± 1012.51 ng/mL. The results indicated that 
      drug-drug interactions (DDI) occurred might be owing to APB affect one or all of 
      OCTs, MATE1, MATE2-K.

LID - e12528
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used to 
      prevent and treat thromboembolism. Although measurement of DOAC concentrations is 
      not currently recommended as part of routine patient care, measurement of DOAC 
      concentrations with anti-factor Xa activity assays have recently become 
      clinically available. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to determine the clinical 
      conditions under which DOAC concentration measurements are requested. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Retrospective electronic medical record analysis of indications for 
      DOAC concentration measurements by anti-factor Xa activity assay at a single 
      academic medical center from July 2015 through April 2020. RESULTS AND 
      CONCLUSIONS: Ninety-one DOAC concentration measurements were made in 69 patients: 
      28 received apixaban and 41 received rivaroxaban. The most frequent indication 
      for concentration measurement was drug exposure assessment (38/69; 55%) in 
      patients with potentially altered pharmacokinetics (altered absorption or 
      clearance), recurrent thromboembolic events, or possible medication nonadherence. 
      Fourteen of 69 patients had repeated measurements during preoperative evaluation 
      before emergent surgery; one-third of those with detectable levels upon 
      presentation had repeated measurements until concentrations were undetectable. 
      Levels were undetectable in 4 of 4 patients scheduled for elective surgery. 
      Eleven of 69 patients had DOAC measurements in the setting of major bleeding; 5 
      of these 11 received a specific DOAC reversal agent. While most of the observed 
      indications appear in clinical guidelines, altered absorption does not. Overall, 
      clinicians are requesting DOAC concentration measurements to evaluate drug 
      exposure in patients with conditions that might alter the absorption or clearance 
      of the DOAC, to evaluate surgical bleeding risk, and in the setting of major 
      bleeding.

TI  - New frontiers in anticoagulation: non vitamin-K oral anticoagulants in stroke 
      prevention.

LID - 10.1080/14737175.2017.1268053 [doi]
AB  - Non vitamin-K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are direct and specific inhibitors of 
      the coagulation factors IIa (dabigatran) and Xa (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) 
      which share many pharmacokinetic properties. However, indications are lacking 
      regarding the use of NOACs during thrombolysis, surgery and bleeding events. 
      Areas covered: In this paper, the authors retrospectively analyzed the relevant 
      literature on the NOACs using the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Expert 
      commentary: Although warfarin is effective in cardioembolic stroke prevention, 
      easier handling and more favorable risk-benefit profile often render NOACs a more 
      preferable therapy choice for neurologists. New evidences have suggested their 
      use in treatment of elderly people, in patients with renal insufficiency or with 
      antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. In addition, the use of antidotes, which 
      rapidly reverse the anticoagulant effect of the NOACs, could be useful in 
      bleeding, during emergency procedures, or in case of overdose.

TI  - Twice- or once-daily dosing of novel oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention: a 
      fixed-effects meta-analysis with predefined heterogeneity quality criteria.
PG  - e99276
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0099276 [doi]
LID - e99276
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of novel oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitors or 
      factor Xa inhibitors) are in clinical use for various indications. The dosing 
      regimens differ between twice-daily and once-daily dosing for the prevention of 
      stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. With the availability of the results 
      from four phase 3 studies (>70,000 patients), we explored whether twice-daily or 
      once-daily dosing provides better risk-benefit balance among novel oral 
      anticoagulants. METHODS: We conducted a strict, stepwise, fixed-effects 
      meta-analysis with predefined heterogeneity quality criteria to generate the most 
      appropriate common estimates for twice-daily (BID) or once-daily (QD) dosing 
      regimens. An indirect comparison of these dosing regimens with fixed-effects 
      meta-analysis common estimates (where available), or individual compound results, 
      was done respectively. RESULTS: Comparing indirectly BID vs QD dosing regimens 
      resulted in hazard ratios (HR [95% confidence interval]) for stroke and systemic 
      embolism of 0.75 (0.58-0.96) for dabigatran 150 mg BID, and 0.91 (0.73-1.13) for 
      apixaban BID vs the QD dosing regimen. For ischemic stroke, the HR of BID vs QD 
      was 0.85 (0.69-1.05). For intracranial hemorrhage, BID vs rivaroxaban QD was 0.57 
      (0.37-0.88) and, vs edoxaban QD, 0.81 (0.54-1.22). Due to heterogeneity, common 
      estimates for major bleeding QD or BID were not justified, therefore indirect 
      comparison of regimens were not possible. All non-vitamin K antagonist oral 
      anticoagulants reduced all-cause mortality vs warfarin with a HR of 0.90 
      (0.86-0.96) without differences between regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the 
      available phase 3 study evidence, the twice-daily dosing regimen of non-vitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants appears to offer a more balanced risk-benefit 
      profile with respect to stroke prevention and intracranial hemorrhage.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation in dialysis patients: time to abandon warfarin?
PG  - 99-105
LID - 10.5301/ijao.5000487 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a frequent clinical complication in dialysis 
      patients, and warfarin therapy represents the most common approach for reducing 
      the risk of stroke in this population. However, current evidence based on 
      observational studies, offer conflicting results, whereas no randomized 
      controlled trials have been carried out so far. Additionally, many clinicians are 
      wary of the possible role of warfarin as vascular calcification inducer and its 
      potential to increase the high risk of bleeding among patients on dialysis. 
      Ideally the most promising therapy would be based on direct inhibitors of factor 
      IIa or Xa; however, at the moment, none of these drugs can be safely prescribed 
      in dialysis patients, because of their potentially dangerous accumulation, and 
      the lack of sufficient experience with apixaban or rivaroxaban, two drugs showing 
      a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in end-stage renal disease. Hence, the use of 
      vitamin K inhibitors is currently the only pharmacological option for stroke 
      prevention in dialysis patients with atrial fibrillation, leaving the clinicians 
      in a management conundrum.This review discusses the trade-offs implicated in 
      warfarin use for this population, the promises of newly developed drugs, the role 
      of dialysis as atrial fibrillation trigger, as well as potential 
      non-pharmacological management options suitable in selected clinical situations.

      hospitalized patients.
PG  - 319-328
LID - 10.1177/2042098617719815 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the prevalence and nature of potential drug-drug 
      interactions (DDIs) with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in elderly 
      hospitalized patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study. 
      Inclusion criteria were: aged over 65 years; taking apixaban, rivaroxaban or 
      dabigatran; and admitted to the Repatriation General Hospital between April 2014 
      and July 2015. A list of clinically relevant 'perpetrator' drugs was compiled 
      from product information, the Australian Medicines Handbook, the Australian 
      National Prescribing Service resources, and local health network guidelines. The 
      prevalence and nature of potential DDIs with DOACs was determined by comparing 
      inpatient drug charts with the list of perpetrator drugs. RESULTS: There were 122 
      patients in the study with a mean age of 82 years. Most patients had nonvalvular 
      atrial fibrillation and were taking DOACs to prevent thrombotic stroke (83%). 
      Overall, 45 patients (37%) had a total of 54 potential DDIs. Thirty-five patients 
      had potential pharmacodynamic DDIs with antidepressants, nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets (35/122, 29%). Nineteen patients had 
      potential pharmacokinetic DDIs (19/122, 16%). Of these, 68% (13/19) were taking 
      drugs that increase DOAC plasma concentrations (amiodarone, erythromycin, 
      diltiazem or verapamil) and 32% (6/19) were taking drugs that decrease DOAC 
      plasma concentrations (carbamazepine, primidone or phenytoin). There were no 
      cases of patients taking contraindicated interacting drugs. DISCUSSION: Potential 
      DDIs with DOACs in elderly hospital inpatients are relatively common, 
      particularly interactions that may increase the risk of bleeding. The 
      risk-benefit ratio of DOACs in elderly patients on polypharmacy should always be 
      carefully considered.

LID - 607852
AB  - Embolism of cardiac origin accounts for about 20% of ischemic strokes. 
      Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is the most frequent cause of cardioembolic 
      stroke. Approximately 1% of population is affected by atrial fibrillation, and 
      its prevalence is growing with ageing in the modern world. Strokes due to 
      cardioembolism are in general severe and prone to early recurrence and have a 
      higher long-term risk of recurrence and mortality. Despite its enormous 
      preventive potential, continuous oral anticoagulation is prescribed for less than 
      half of patients with atrial fibrillation who have risk factors for 
      cardioembolism and no contraindications for anticoagulation. Available evidence 
      does not support routine immediate anticoagulation of acute cardioembolic stroke. 
      Anticoagulation therapy's associated risk of hemorrhage and monitoring 
      requirements have encouraged the investigation of alternative therapies for 
      individuals with atrial fibrillation. New anticoagulants being tested for 
      prevention of stroke are low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH), unfractionated 
      heparin, factor Xa inhibitors, or direct thrombin inhibitors like dabigatran 
      etexilate and rivaroxaban. The later exhibit stable pharmacokinetics obviating 
      the need for coagulation monitoring or dose titration, and they lack clinically 
      significant food or drug interaction. Moreover, they offer another potential that 
      includes fixed dosing, oral administration, and rapid onset of action. There are 
      several concerns regarding potential harm, including an increased risk for 
      hepatotoxicity, clinically significant bleeding, and acute coronary events. 
      Therefore, additional trials and postmarketing surveillance will be needed.

TI  - Drug interactions between direct-acting oral anticoagulants and calcineurin 
      inhibitors during solid organ transplantation: considerations for therapy.
PG  - 781-790
LID - 10.1080/17512433.2019.1637733 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: There is a high incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in solid 
      organ transplant recipients. The safety and efficacy of direct-acting oral 
      anticoagulants (DOAC) have been well established in clinical practice for the 
      prevention and treatment of VTE in broad populations. However, the management of 
      VTE in the setting of solid organ transplantation remains a challenge to 
      clinicians due to limited evidence of DOAC usage with calcineurin inhibitors. 
      Areas covered: The current literature available on the 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interaction between DOACs and calcineurin 
      inhibitors is presented. A comprehensive review was undertaken using PubMed, 
      Embase, drug product labeling, and drug product review conducted by the US Food 
      and Drug Administration using Drugs@FDA. The potential for mitigation strategies 
      and clinical management using extant knowledge is explored. Expert opinion: 
      Immunosuppression therapy is necessary to prevent graft rejection by the host. 
      The sparsity of data together with the lack of well-designed prospective studies 
      of DOAC use in solid organ transplant recipients presents a unique challenge to 
      clinicians in determining the clinical relevance of possible drug interactions. 
      Existing evidence suggests that with attention to concomitant drug use and renal 
      function, the co-administration of DOACs and calcineurin inhibitors is safe and 
      effective.

AB  - Until the last decade, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the only agents 
      available for oral anticoagulation. Although effective and accessible, their use 
      was complicated by a narrow therapeutic window, the need for regular monitoring 
      of the international normalized ratio, and an associated susceptibility to 
      interactions with both food and numerous medications. Furthermore, the onset of 
      action was delayed, often requiring bridging with intravenous agents. In more 
      recent years, we have enjoyed the development of nonvitamin-K-dependent, direct 
      oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which either directly inhibit the activity of factor 
      IIa (eg, dabigatran) or factor Xa (eg, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban). These 
      medications boast a more rapid onset of action, predictable pharmacokinetics, 
      wider therapeutic window, and equal or superior safety profiles. Although these 
      medications appear to have fewer drug-drug interactions than VKAs, their 
      interactions remain of clinical importance, particularly in one of the largest 
      populations requiring anticoagulation: patients with atrial fibrillation. These 
      patients are rarely on single medications, with the majority of them requiring 
      some form of rate or rhythm control due to their arrhythmia. Unfortunately, data 
      on interactions between DOACs and antiarrhythmic medications, despite their 
      common coadministration, remain limited. Here, we summarize the interactions 
      between antiarrhythmics and VKAs and review existing knowledge regarding their 
      interactions with DOACs.

AB  - Given the growing number of patients on antithrombotic therapy we are 
      increasingly confronted with the management of this therapy before, during and 
      after vitreoretinal surgery. In the absence of a consensus, the decision to 
      withdraw antithrombotic therapy is based on the cardiovascular thromboembolism 
      risk versus the theoretical risk of bleeding if the antithrombotic treatment is 
      continued. As suggested by the literature, antiplatelet therapy (acetylsalicylic 
      acid or clopidogrel) may be safely continued for vitreoretinal surgery, including 
      retinal detachment repair. However, the risk/benefit ratio for patients being 
      treated with two antiplatelet therapies is unknown. It appears that an 
      International Normalized Ratio (INR) less than 3 for patients treated with 
      anticoagulant therapy does not increase the perioperative risk of ocular 
      bleeding. This risk has not been evaluated in patients treated by new 
      antithrombotic therapies (prasugrel, ticagrelor as antiplatelet medication, or 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban as anticoagulant therapy), and there is a need 
      to study it further.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who use a direct oral 
      anticoagulant (DOAC) and request elective surgery or procedure present a common 
      clinical situation yet perioperative management is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To 
      investigate the safety of a standardized perioperative DOAC management strategy. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Perioperative Anticoagulation Use for 
      Surgery Evaluation (PAUSE) cohort study conducted at 23 clinical centers in 
      Canada, the United States, and Europe enrolled and screened patients from August 
      1, 2014, through July 31, 2018. Participants (n = 3007) had AF; were 18 years of 
      age or older; were long-term users of apixaban, dabigatran etexilate, or 
      rivaroxaban; were scheduled for an elective surgery or procedure; and could 
      adhere to the DOAC therapy interruption protocol. INTERVENTIONS: A simple 
      standardized perioperative DOAC therapy interruption and resumption strategy 
      based on DOAC pharmacokinetic properties, procedure-associated bleeding risk, and 
      creatinine clearance levels. The DOAC regimens were omitted for 1 day before a 
      low-bleeding-risk procedure and 2 days before a high-bleeding-risk procedure. The 
      DOAC regimens were resumed 1 day after a low-bleeding-risk procedure and 2 to 3 
      days after a high-bleeding-risk procedure. Follow-up of patients occurred for 30 
      days after the operation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Major bleeding and arterial 
      thromboembolism (ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, and transient ischemic 
      attack) and the proportion of patients with an undetectable or minimal residual 
      anticoagulant level (<50 ng/mL) at the time of the procedure. RESULTS: The 3007 
      patients with AF (mean [SD] age of 72.5 [9.39] years; 1988 men [66.1%]) comprised 
      1257 (41.8%) in the apixaban cohort, 668 (22.2%) in the dabigatran cohort, and 
      1082 (36.0%) in the rivaroxaban cohort; 1007 patients (33.5%) had a 
      high-bleeding-risk procedure. The 30-day postoperative rate of major bleeding was 
      1.35% (95% CI, 0%-2.00%) in the apixaban cohort, 0.90% (95% CI, 0%-1.73%) in the 
      dabigatran cohort, and 1.85% (95% CI, 0%-2.65%) in the rivaroxaban cohort. The 
      rate of arterial thromboembolism was 0.16% (95% CI, 0%-0.48%) in the apixaban 
      cohort, 0.60% (95% CI, 0%-1.33%) in the dabigatran cohort, and 0.37% (95% CI, 
      0%-0.82%) in the rivaroxaban cohort. In patients with a high-bleeding-risk 
      procedure, the rates of major bleeding were 2.96% (95% CI, 0%-4.68%) in the 
      apixaban cohort and 2.95% (95% CI, 0%-4.76%) in the rivaroxaban cohort. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, patients with AF who had DOAC therapy 
      interruption for elective surgery or procedure, a perioperative management 
      strategy without heparin bridging or coagulation function testing was associated 
      with low rates of major bleeding and arterial thromboembolism.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulant drugs (DOACs) interfere with the coagulation process, 
      thus improving patient care for those who require anticoagulant treatment. This 
      study presents a descriptive analysis of adverse reactions (ADRs) attributed to 
      DOAC dosage errors (overdose, underdose, and improper dose). The analysis was 
      performed based on the Individual Case Safety Reports from the EudraVigilance 
      (EV) database. Results show that data reported for rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
      edoxaban, and dabigatran are mostly regarding underdosing (51.56%) compared to 
      overdosing (18.54%). The most dosage error reports were identified for 
      rivaroxaban (54.02%), followed by apixaban (33.61%). Dabigatran and edoxaban had 
      similar percentages (6.26% and 6.11%, respectively) regarding dosage error 
      reports. Since coagulation issues can become life-threatening events, and factors 
      such as advanced age and renal failure can influence the pharmacokinetics of 
      drugs, the correct usage of DOACs is of utmost importance for the management and 
      prevention of venous thromboembolism. Thus, the collaboration and the 
      complementarity of knowledge of physicians and pharmacists may offer a reliable 
      solution for DOAC dose management and improve patient care.

TI  - Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with 
      Extremely Low and High Body Weight-Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12154969 [doi]
LID - 4969
AB  - Phase III clinical trials for individual direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      contained a limited representation of subjects with abnormal body weight, which 
      were mostly limited to a BMI > 40 kg/m(2), or body weight > 120 kg for obese 
      subjects, and <50 kg for underweight subjects. Although low or high body weight 
      is not a contraindication to DOACs therapy, it can significantly affect the 
      safety and effectiveness of treatment. Due to the limited amount of clinical data 
      on the use of DOACs in extremely abnormal weight ranges, optimal pharmacotherapy 
      in this group of patients is a matter of controversy. The objective of this study 
      was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of DOAC properties in patients with abnormal 
      body weight beyond the established cut-off points in the phase III studies for 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran. In total, 38 patients took DOACs for at 
      least 12 months for non-valvular atrial fibrillation in 2019-2021. Blood samples 
      were collected before the planned intake of the drug and 4 h after its 
      administration. The determined concentrations of DOACs were statistically 
      analyzed in relation to body weight, age, and eGFR (estimated Glomerular 
      Filtration Rate). Among subjects taking apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran, 
      the smallest representation of patients who achieved therapeutic concentrations 
      were those treated with dabigatran. The population of people with abnormal body 
      weight is a potential risk group of patients, in which some of them do not reach 
      the therapeutic range of DOACs.

AB  - Aims: Observational studies of various dose levels of direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs) for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) found that a high proportion 
      of patients received a dose lower than the target dose tested in randomized 
      controlled trials. There is a need to compare low-dose DOACs with warfarin or 
      other DOACs on effectiveness and safety. Methods: Using administrative data from 
      Quebec province, Canada, we built a cohort of new warfarin or DOAC users 
      discharged from hospital between 2011 and 2017. We determined CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc 
      and HAS-BLED scores, and comorbidities for 3-year prior cohort entry. The primary 
      effectiveness endpoint was a composite of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (SE), 
      and secondary outcomes included a safety composite of major bleeding (MB) events 
      and effectiveness composite (stroke/SE, death) at 1-year follow-up. We contrasted 
      each low-dose DOAC with warfarin or other DOACs as references using inverse 
      probability of treatment weighting to estimate marginal Cox hazard ratios (HRs). 
      Results: The cohort comprised 22,969 patients (mean age: 80-86). We did not find 
      a significant risk reduction for the stroke/SE primary effectiveness endpoint for 
      DOACs vs. warfarin; however, we observed a significantly lower risk for low-dose 
      dabigatran vs. warfarin (HR [95%CI]: 0.59 [0.42-0.81]) for effectiveness 
      composite, mainly due to a lower death rate. The differences in effectiveness and 
      safety composites between low-dose rivaroxaban vs. warfarin were not significant. 
      However, low-dose apixaban had a better safety composite (HR: 0.68 [0.53-0.88]) 
      vs. warfarin. Comparisons of dabigatran vs. apixaban showed a lower risk of 
      stroke/SE (HR: 0.53 [0.30-0.93]) and a 2-fold higher risk of MB. The MB risk was 
      higher for rivaroxaban than for apixaban (HR: 1.58 [1.09-2.29]). Conclusions: The 
      results of this population-based study suggest that low-dose dabigatran has a 
      better effective composite than warfarin. Compared with apixaban, low-dose 
      dabigatran had a better effectiveness composite but a worse safety profile. 
      Low-dose apixaban had a better safety composite than warfarin and other low-dose 
      DOACs. Given that the comparative effectiveness and safety seem to vary from one 
      DOAC to another, pharmacokinetic data for specific populations are now warranted.

AB  - The understanding of the clotting system emerged in parallel to the development 
      of anticoagulants. In contrast to vitamin K-antagonists and heparins that where 
      discovered by chance, new anticoagulants have been systematically designed to 
      specifically inhibit single clotting factors. Both clotting factors Xa (FXa) and 
      thrombin play a crucial role within the new cell-based model of hemostasis. Thus 
      it is obvious that FXa and thrombin turned out to be ideal targets for 
      anticoagulation. The proof of the concept of selective inhibition of thrombin and 
      FXa has been provided by hirudin and fondaparinux, respectively. By now, a whole 
      group of new oral anticoagulants has been licensed: the direct FXa-inhibitors 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban as well as the direct thrombin dabigatran 
      etexilate. Furthermore, a bundle of FXa- and thrombin-inhibitors that differ from 
      the so far licensed products mainly in pharmacokinetics are in an advanced phase 
      of development. A further innovative concept of anticoagulation that entered its 
      clinical phase of development is the inhibition of factor VIII. Other new 
      concepts such as inhibition of initiation of coagulation by blocking factor VIIa, 
      inhibition of contact factor XII, or inhibition of factor IX are in an early 
      phase of development.

TI  - New anticoagulants for the prevention of venous thromboembolism.
PG  - 49-60
AB  - Anticoagulant drugs have an essential role in the prevention and treatment of 
      thromboembolic diseases. Currently available anticoagulants substantially reduce 
      the incidence of thromboembolic events in a number of clinical conditions. 
      However, these agents have limitations that strengthen the case for the 
      development of new anticoagulants. An ideal anticoagulant should be at least as 
      effective as those currently in use, as well as safe, simple to use, and widely 
      applicable.The majority of new anticoagulants currently under investigation are 
      small molecules with a selective and direct anti-Xa or antithrombin action, 
      allowing oral administration in fixed doses. These new agents are in different 
      phases of clinical development. The anti-Xa agent rivaroxaban and the 
      antithrombin agent dabigatran are already available for the prophylaxis of venous 
      thromboembolism in some countries. Apixaban is in an advanced phase of clinical 
      development and several anti-Xa agents are currently approaching phase III 
      clinical trials. Promising results in terms of efficacy and safety profiles have 
      been obtained with these agents in different clinical conditions. Differences in 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics could offer the potential for 
      individualized anticoagulant therapies in the near future.

TI  - New oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation: are they worth the risk?
PG  - 54-64
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the U.S. 
      Anticoagulation is recommended for stroke prevention in AF patients with 
      intermediate-to-high stroke risk (i.e., patients with a CHADS2 score of 1 or 
      greater). Warfarin was previously the only option for oral anticoagulation in 
      these patients, but three new oral anticoagulants have become available as 
      alternatives for warfarin in patients with nonvalvular AF. The advantages of the 
      newer agents include a rapid onset, predictable pharmacokinetics, and no need for 
      routine anticoagulation monitoring. Dabigatran (Pradaxa) and apixaban (Eliquis) 
      have demonstrated improved efficacy compared with warfarin. Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) 
      was non-inferior to warfarin for stroke prevention in AF. Apixaban demonstrated a 
      reduced incidence of major bleeding compared with warfarin and a reduction in 
      all-cause mortality. Limitations to the use of the new oral anticoagulants 
      include the lack of a reversal agent; an inability to use the therapies in 
      specific patient populations (such as those with severe renal or hepatic 
      impairment); limited experience with drug-drug and drug-disease interactions; and 
      a lack of available coagulation tests to quantify their effects. Although the 
      newer agents have higher acquisition costs, the benefits of cost savings may be 
      derived from the potential for decreasing the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke and 
      intracranial bleeding and reducing the need for anticoagulation monitoring. 
      Benefits and risks should be carefully weighed before these agents are prescribed 
      for patients presenting with new-onset AF.

TI  - Development of a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model for Ritonavir 
      characterizing exposure and drug interaction potential at both acute and 
      steady-state conditions.
LID - 10.1002/psp4.13293 [doi]
AB  - Ritonavir (RTV) is a potent CYP3A inhibitor that is widely used as a 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer to increase exposure to select protease inhibitors. 
      However, as a strong and complex perpetrator of CYP3A interactions, RTV can also 
      enhance the exposure of other co-administered CYP3A substrates, potentially 
      causing toxicity. Therefore, the prediction of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and 
      estimation of dosing requirements for concomitantly administered drugs is 
      imperative. In this study, we aimed to develop a physiologically-based PK (PBPK) 
      model for RTV using the PK-sim® software platform. A total of 13 clinical PK 
      studies of RTV covering a wide dose range (100 to 600 mg including both single 
      and multiple dosing), and eight clinical DDI studies with RTV on CYP3A and P-gp 
      substrates, including alprazolam, midazolam, rivaroxaban, clarithromycin, 
      fluconazole, sildenafil, and digoxin were used for the model development and 
      evaluation. Chronopharmacokinetic differences (between morning vs. evening doses) 
      and limitations in parameter estimation for biochemical processes of RTV from 
      in vitro studies were incorporated in the PBPK model. The final developed PBPK 
      model predicted 100% of RTV AUC(last) and C(max) within a twofold dimension 
      error. The geometric mean fold error (GMFE) from all PK datasets was 1.275 and 
      1.194, respectively. In addition, 97% of the DDI profiles were predicted with the 
      DDI ratios within a twofold dimension error. The GMFE values from all DDI 
      datasets were 1.297 and 1.212, respectively. Accordingly, this model could be 
      applied to the prediction of DDI profiles of RTV and CYP3A substrates and used to 
      estimate dosing requirements for concomitantly administered drugs.

      Review.
PG  - 25-36
LID - 10.4137/HSI.S40701 [doi]
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are in wide use among patients requiring both 
      short- and long-term anticoagulation, mainly due to their ease of use and the 
      lack of monitoring requirements. With growing use of DOACs, it is imperative that 
      physicians be able to manage patients on these medications, especially in the 
      perioperative period. We aim to provide guidance on the management of DOACs in 
      the perioperative period. In this review, we performed an extensive literature 
      search summarizing the management of patients on direct-acting anticoagulants in 
      the perioperative period. A total of four direct-acting oral anticoagulants were 
      considered appropriate for inclusion in this review. The drugs were dabigatran 
      etexilate mesylate (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), and 
      edoxaban (Savaysa). Management of patients on DOACs in the perioperative period 
      involves an assessment of thromboembolic event risk while off anticoagulation 
      compared to the relative risk of bleeding if such drug is continued. DOACs may 
      not need to be discontinued in minor surgeries or procedures, and in major 
      surgeries, they may be discontinued hours prior depending on drug 
      pharmacokinetics and renal function of the patients.

AB  - Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation- (NVAF-) related stroke and venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) are cardiovascular diseases associated with significant 
      morbidity and economic burden. The historical standard treatment of VTE has been 
      the administration of parenteral heparinoid until oral warfarin therapy attains a 
      therapeutic international normalized ratio. Warfarin has been the most common 
      medication for stroke prevention in NVAF. Warfarin use is complicated by a narrow 
      therapeutic window, unpredictable dose response, numerous food and drug 
      interactions, and requirements for frequent monitoring. To overcome these 
      disadvantages, direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs)-dabigatran, rivaroxaban, 
      apixaban, and edoxaban-have been developed for the prevention of stroke or 
      systemic embolic events (SEE) in patients with NVAF and for the treatment of VTE. 
      Advantages of DOACs include predictable pharmacokinetics, few drug-drug 
      interactions, and low monitoring requirements. In clinical studies, DOACs are 
      noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of NVAF-related stroke and the 
      treatment and prevention of VTE as well as postoperative knee and hip surgery VTE 
      prophylaxis, with decreased bleeding risks. This review addresses the practical 
      considerations for the emergency physician in DOAC use, including dosing 
      recommendations, laboratory monitoring, anticoagulation reversal, and 
      cost-effectiveness. The challenges of DOACs, such as the lack of specific 
      laboratory measurements and antidotes, are also discussed.

AB  - The periprocedural management of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant 
      therapy remains a common but difficult clinical problem, with a lack of 
      high-quality evidence to inform best practices. It is a patient's thromboembolic 
      risk that drives the need for an aggressive periprocedural strategy, including 
      the use of heparin bridging therapy, to minimize time off anticoagulant therapy, 
      while the procedural bleed risk determines how and when postprocedural 
      anticoagulant therapy should be resumed. Warfarin should be continued in patients 
      undergoing selected minor procedures, whereas in major procedures that 
      necessitate warfarin interruption, heparin bridging therapy should be considered 
      in patients at high thromboembolic risk and in a minority of patients at moderate 
      risk. Periprocedural data with the novel oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, 
      rivaroxaban, and apixaban, are emerging, but their relatively short half-life, 
      rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics should simplify 
      periprocedural use. This review aims to provide a practical, clinician-focused 
      approach to periprocedural anticoagulant management.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide. The prevalence 
      of AF in persons older than 55 years is at least 33.5 million globally and is 
      predicted to more than double in the next half-century. Anticoagulation, heart 
      rate control, and heart rhythm control comprise the 3 main treatment strategies 
      in AF. Anticoagulation is aimed at preventing debilitating stroke, systemic 
      embolism, and associated mortality. Historically, anticoagulation in AF was 
      achieved with a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin, which is supported by 
      evidence demonstrating reduced incident stroke and all-cause mortality. However, 
      warfarin has unpredictable pharmacokinetics with many drug-drug interactions that 
      require regular monitoring to ensure patients remain in the therapeutic 
      anticoagulant range. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants including 
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban provide a possible solution to 
      these issues with their more predictable pharmacokinetics, rapid onset of action, 
      and greater specificity. Results from large randomized, controlled trials 
      indicate that these agents are at least noninferior to warfarin in prevention of 
      stroke. These trials also demonstrate a consistently lower incidence of 
      intracranial hemorrhage, almost always all life-threatening bleeds, and many 
      forms of major bleeds with the possible exception of gastrointestinal and some 
      other forms of mucosal bleeding, compared with warfarin. Patients with AF are a 
      heterogeneous population with diverse risk of stroke and bleeding, and different 
      subgroups respond differently to anticoagulation. Important clinical questions 
      have arisen regarding optimal anticoagulation drug selection in distinct 
      populations such as those with renal impairment, older age, coronary artery 
      disease, and heart failure as well as those at particularly high risk for 
      bleeding or thromboembolism. In this review, treatment strategies in AF 
      management are discussed in the context of different individual subgroups of 
      patients.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis: 
      Magnitude of the problem and new approach to oral anticoagulation.
PG  - 578-588
LID - 10.1002/rth2.12250 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a frequent comorbid condition in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (HD) with a prevalence of up to 27%. The 
      incidence rate of stroke in AF patients on HD is approximately 5%. The 
      AF-associated risk of stroke is a major clinical challenge because current 
      evidence for anticoagulation in HD patients with AF is based on observational 
      data. Results from these observational studies is largely contradictory because 
      they do not show a clear benefit of vitamin K antagonists over no treatment in 
      terms of stroke prevention, and they show an increased risk of hemorrhage 
      associated with anticoagulation treatment in HD patients. HD patients were not 
      included in randomized trials of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), and 
      therefore there is no evidence to support efficacy and safety of DOACs compared 
      to vitamin K antagonists in HD patients. The pharmacological characteristics of 
      DOACs are of particular interest in the HD setting. The factor Xa inhibitors 
      rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are not predominantly eliminated via the 
      kidneys. The thrombin inhibitor dabigatran is 80% eliminated via the kidneys but 
      is dialyzable due to its low protein binding. In this narrative review, we 
      examine the current state of evidence regarding the prevalence of AF in patients 
      on HD, the associated risk of stroke, and the efficacy and safety of 
      anticoagulation for stroke prevention in the HD setting. Further, based on the 
      pharmacokinetic properties of DOACs, we discuss their potential use in patients 
      on HD and ongoing randomized trials.

TI  - Peak plasma concentration of direct oral anticoagulants in obese patients 
      weighing over 120 kilograms: A retrospective study.
PG  - 684-688
LID - 10.1002/rth2.12146 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to a paucity of data on the efficacy and safety of direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with a body mass index >40 kg/m(2) or a weight 
      >120 kg, the use of DOACs in this group is not recommended. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the proportion of obese patients with body weight >120 kg with a peak 
      plasma concentration of DOACs lower than the expected median trough level derived 
      from population pharmacokinetic studies for each DOAC. METHODS: Patients with 
      body weight >120 kg taking DOACs for any indication underwent a peak drug 
      concentration measurement at steady state. RESULTS: 38 patients were included in 
      the analysis. The mean age was 64 ± 11 years, and 30 (79%) were males. The median 
      body weight was 132.5 kg (interquartile range [IQR] 127-146.5). The median peak 
      concentrations (IQR) were 148 ng/mL (138-240), 138 ng/mL (123-156.5), 215 ng/mL 
      (181-249) for apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, respectively. Two patients 
      (5%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5%-18%) had a peak plasma concentration 
      lower than the median trough and eight (21%, 95% CI: 11%-37%) had a peak plasma 
      concentration below the fifth percentile (10th percentile for dabigatran) peak 
      concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients in our study had peak plasma 
      concentration higher than the median trough level for each of the three DOACs. 
      However, 21% had a peak plasma concentration that was below the usual on-therapy 
      range of peak concentration for the corresponding DOAC.

TI  - In Vitro Comparison of the Role of P-Glycoprotein and Breast Cancer Resistance 
      Protein on Direct Oral Anticoagulants Disposition.
PG  - 183-191
LID - 10.1007/s13318-017-0434-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacokinetics of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are influenced 
      by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and 
      Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). OBJECTIVES: To better understand the 
      role of transporters in DOAC disposition, we evaluated and compared the 
      permeabilities and transport properties of these drugs. METHODS: Bidirectional 
      permeabilities of DOACs were investigated across Caco-2 cells monolayer. 
      Transport assays were performed using different concentrations of DOAC and 
      specific inhibitors of ABC transporters. Cell model functionality was evaluated 
      by transport assay of two positive control substrates. RESULTS: The results of 
      transport assays suggest a concentration-dependent efflux of apixaban, dabigatran 
      etexilate and edoxaban, whereas the efflux transport of rivaroxaban did not seem 
      to depend on concentration. Verapamil, a strong inhibitor of P-gp, decreased DOAC 
      efflux in the Caco-2 cell model by 12-87%, depending on the drug tested. Ko143 
      reduced BCRP-mediated DOAC efflux in Caco-2 cells by 46-76%. CONCLUSION: This 
      study allowed identification of three different profiles of ABC carrier-mediated 
      transport: predominantly P-gp-dependent transport (dabigatran), preferential 
      BCRP-dependent transport (apixaban) and approximately equivalent P-gp and 
      BCRP-mediated transport (edoxaban and rivaroxaban).

TI  - Direct Oral Anticoagulants for the Prevention of Stroke in Patients with 
      Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation: Understanding Differences and Similarities.
PG  - 1627-44
LID - 10.1007/s40265-015-0452-4 [doi]
AB  - The presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac 
      arrhythmia, significantly increases the risk for stroke. Current guidelines 
      recommend that the vitamin K antagonist warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs), such as the approved direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the 
      approved direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban, should 
      be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients with nonvalvular AF at risk for stroke 
      or systemic embolic events (SEE). Warfarin, the mainstay of stroke prevention in 
      AF, increases the risk of major bleeding. Furthermore, warfarin therapy comes 
      with several limitations including frequent monitoring and the need for dose 
      adjustments, unpredictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and the 
      potential for significant drug-drug and food-drug interactions. The DOACs were 
      developed to overcome these limitations while maintaining or surpassing 
      warfarin's efficacy and safety profiles. All four DOACs have similar or better 
      efficacy and safety compared with warfarin and are therefore valuable 
      alternatives for the prevention of stroke and SEE in patients with nonvalvular 
      AF. Understanding the subtle differences in the DOACs' pharmacology, phase 3 
      study designs, and trial outcomes will allow for a more tailored approach in 
      selecting the right oral anticoagulant for each patient.

AB  - Two novel oral anticoagulants, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, have recently been 
      approved. They differ in many ways from warfarin, including rapid onset of 
      action, shorter half-life, fewer drug-drug interactions, lack of need for 
      monitoring, and no need for titration or dose adjustments. These novel agents 
      represent a landmark shift in anticoagulant care; however, many aspects of their 
      use will be unfamiliar to practicing clinicians, despite the imminent widespread 
      use of these agents in the community. The management of these anticoagulants when 
      transitioning from or back to warfarin, around surgery or in case of major 
      hemorrhage, requires knowledge of their pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action. 
      Unfortunately, there is a limited evidence base to inform decisions around 
      management of these agents. We present our practice in these settings supported, 
      where available, with literature evidence.

TI  - Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation: safety issues in the elderly.
PG  - 1309-1327
LID - 10.1080/17512433.2020.1842191 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are 
      increasingly used for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation 
      (AF). Since NOACs are predominantly used in the elderly with AF at high risk for 
      stroke and bleeding and with comorbidities requiring polypharmacy, it is 
      important to assess their safety and efficacy in this population. AREAS COVERED: 
      We review changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics observed with 
      senescence and the effect on NOACs and drug and food interactions. We also 
      provide an update on challenges related to NOAC use in situations that increases 
      the risk for bleeding or require temporary discontinuation and address practical 
      issues in the elderly AF patients managed on NOACs. Clinical studies and trials 
      with cardiovascular outcomes reported from January 1990 to August 2020 were 
      identified through the Medline database using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and 
      EMBASE database. EXPERT OPINION: NOACs are highly effective in preventing stroke 
      in AF patients with non-inferior or superior efficacy to warfarin, with reduced 
      risk of major bleeding. However, in the older-elderly, evidence comes mainly from 
      observational studies or extrapolation from studies in populations with minimal 
      functional limitations or comorbidities. The high upfront cost and out-of-pocket 
      expense for copayment or deductibles also limit the use of this effective therapy 
      in a substantial number of patients. The cost reduction may further improve 
      long-term use for NOACs in stroke prevention in elderly patients with AF.

LID - 10.1055/s-0032-1311795 [doi]
AB  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains the most common preventable cause of death 
      in hospitalized patients. There is much evidence to show the efficacy of 
      prophylactic strategies to prevent VTE in at-risk hospitalized patients. For 
      example, pharmacological prophylaxis reduces the risk of pulmonary embolism by 
      75% in general surgical patients and by 57% in medical patients. Thus 
      international guidelines strongly recommend effective preventive strategies for 
      all hospitalized patients defined as moderate to high risk for VTE. Effective 
      pharmacological thromboprophylaxis includes low-dose unfractionated heparin 
      (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, and warfarin. 
      Mechanical prophylaxis with graduated compression stockings and intermittent 
      pneumatic compression is also recommended as an alternative or in combination 
      with pharmacological prophylaxis. Although the volume of evidence supporting the 
      use of thromboprophylaxis is growing, the number of patients receiving adequate 
      prophylaxis is not. Several studies have shown that nearly half of the patients 
      undergoing major surgery or hospitalized for medical illnesses do not receive 
      appropriate antithrombotic prophylaxis. Reducing the discrepancy between 
      evidence-based recommendations and clinical practice seems to be a cost-effective 
      goal. Developing and promoting local protocols and educational activities to 
      encourage prophylaxis in daily clinical practice may be effective. New oral 
      anticoagulant drugs with potentially favorable pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic characteristics have been developed. After the positive results 
      of phase 3 clinical trials, some of these drugs have been approved for clinical 
      use in the prevention of VTE in the high-risk setting of major orthopedic 
      surgery. These agents include the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate 
      and the direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban.

TI  - Direct Oral Anticoagulant Failures in Atrial Fibrillation With Stroke: 
      Retrospective Admission Analysis and Novel Classification System.
PG  - 256-265
LID - 10.1177/19418744231161390 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Breakthrough acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in patients with known, 
      nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation (AF), on Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC), is an 
      ongoing clinical conundrum. Switching anticoagulants was shown to be ineffective 
      in preventing recurrent AIS. Systematic, patient-level chart review of so-called 
      "DOAC failures" may offer insight into this phenomenon. METHODS: We conducted an 
      IRB-approved, 6-year, retrospective study of AIS admissions, already prescribed 
      DOAC for known AF. We sought plausible, alternative reasons for the AIS using a 
      novel classification schema, CLAMP: C for Compliance concerns, L for Lacunes 
      (small-vessel disease), A for Arteriopathy (atherosclerosis, web, or vasculitis), 
      M for Malignancy, and P for Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO). These categories were 
      labeled as DOAC "Pseudo-failures." Conversely, absence of CLAMP variables were 
      labeled as DOAC "Crypto-failures" conceivably from AF itself ("atriopathy") or 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenomic dysfunction (ie, altered DOAC absorption, 
      clearance, metabolism, or genetic polymorphisms). Forward logistic regression 
      analysis was performed on prespecified DOAC subgroups. RESULTS: Of 4890 AIS 
      admissions, 606 had AF, and 87 were previously prescribed DOAC (14.4% overall 
      DOAC failure rate, 2.4% annualized over 6 years). Pseudo-failures comprised 77%: 
      Compliance concerns (48.9%), Lacunes (5.7%), Arteriopathy (17.0%), Malignancy 
      (26.1%), and PFO (2.3%). Crypto-failures comprised 23%, had lower CHADSVASc 
      scores (AOR = .65, P = .013), and occurred more with rivaroxaban (41%) than 
      apixaban (16%) or dabigatran (5.6%). CONCLUSION: In AIS patients with known AF, 
      DOAC Pseudo-failures, with identified alternate etiologies, are 3 times more 
      likely than DOAC Crypto-failures. The CLAMP schema represents a novel approach to 
      diagnostic classification and therapeutic adjustments in patients already 
      prescribed DOAC for AF.

      Thromboembolism: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 194-204
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.013267 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in 
      the elderly, particularly bleeding risks, is unclear despite the presence of 
      greater comorbidities, polypharmacy, and altered pharmacokinetics in this age 
      group. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
      randomized trials of DOACs (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) for 
      efficacy and bleeding outcomes in comparison with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in 
      elderly participants (aged ≥75 years) treated for acute venous thromboembolism or 
      stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Nineteen studies were eligible for 
      inclusion, but only 11 reported data specifically for elderly participants. The 
      efficacy in managing thrombotic risks for each DOAC was similar or superior to 
      VKA in elderly patients. A nonsignificantly higher risk of major bleeding than 
      with VKA was observed with dabigatran 150 mg (odds ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence 
      interval, 0.97-1.44) but not with the 110-mg dose. Significantly higher 
      gastrointestinal bleeding risks with dabigatran 150 mg (1.78, 1.35-2.35) and 
      dabigatran 110 mg (1.40, 1.04-1.90) and lower intracranial bleeding risks than 
      VKA for dabigatran 150 mg (0.43, 0.26-0.72) and dabigatran 110 mg (0.36, 
      0.22-0.61) were also observed. A significantly lower major bleeding risk in 
      comparison with VKA was observed for apixaban (0.63, 0.51-0.77), edoxaban 60 mg 
      (0.81, 0.67-0.98), and 30 mg (0.46, 0.38-0.57), whereas rivaroxaban showed 
      similar risks. CONCLUSIONS: DOACs demonstrated at least equal efficacy to VKA in 
      managing thrombotic risks in the elderly, but bleeding patterns were distinct. In 
      particular, dabigatran was associated with a higher risk of gastrointestinal 
      bleeding than VKA. Insufficient published data for apixaban, edoxaban, and 
      rivaroxaban indicate that further work is needed to clarify the bleeding risks of 
      these DOACs in the elderly. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION:

AB  - Based on established risk scores, such as the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score, the 
      indications for oral anticoagulation are given for patients over 65 years old 
      with atrial fibrillation and even more so for patients over 75 years old. Before 
      beginning anticoagulation a geriatric assessment for evaluation of the cognitive 
      ability, the activities of daily living and the risk of falling should be made 
      because of the known complications of anticoagulation. Geriatric patients with 
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) are increasingly being treated with 
      non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) to prevent ischemic stroke. 
      The European Society for Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of AF 
      recommended NOACs as the preferred treatment and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) only 
      as an alternative option. Meanwhile, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban as 
      factor Xa inhibitors and dabigatran as a thrombin inhibitor, are more commonly 
      used in clinical practice in patients with AF. Although, these drugs have 
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic similarities and are often grouped together, 
      it is important to recognize that the pharmacology and dose regimens differ 
      between compounds. Especially in elderly patients the new drugs have interesting 
      advantages compared to VKA, i. e., less drug-drug interactions with concomitant 
      medication and a more favorable risk-benefit ratio mostly driven by the reduction 
      of bleeding. Treatment of anticoagulation in elderly patients requires weighing 
      the serious risk of stroke with an equally high risk of major bleeding and 
      pharmacoeconomic considerations. The easier practicality of NOACs in routine 
      practice must be emphasized as no international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring 
      is necessary and the interruption of treatment for planned interventions is 
      uncomplicated. A regular monitoring of the indications for NOACs is indispensable 
      (as for all other medications). Especially elderly patients have the greatest 
      benefit from NOAC along with a low renal elimination rate and they should 
      certainly not be withheld from elderly patients who have a clear need for oral 
      anticoagulation.

AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are among the most effective options to 
      prevent serious thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. 
      Coagulation assays are used to assess DOAC activity, but lack the possibility to 
      quantify drugs with concurrent pharmacodynamic effect. We developed a selective 
      multi-drug assay to analyze apixaban, betrixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, edoxaban 
      M4, and rivaroxaban with ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to 
      tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) in plasma fulfilling all requirements of 
      the FDA und EMA guidelines for bioanalytical method validation. Plasma samples 
      were extracted using solid phase extraction in a 96-well micro volume format. 
      Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters BEH Phenyl 1.7μm column 
      coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Extraction recoveries exceeded 80 %. 
      Concentrations of 1-1000 ng/ml can be precisely quantified (correlation 
      coefficient of >0.99) using 100 μL plasma volume. Intra-day and inter-day 
      accuracies ranged between 91.0 % and 116 %. Precisions at low and high 
      concentrations were below 13.3 %. The method was applied within a clinical drug 
      trial and eight short pharmacokinetic profiles of patients under DOAC therapy 
      were analyzed. The assay allows for highly sensitive and selective simultaneous 
      quantification of DOACs in patient plasma samples.

TI  - Prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism: the 
      role of novel oral anticoagulants.
PG  - 175-94
AB  - Venous thromboembolism, encompassing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, 
      is the third most common cause of vascular death after myocardial infarction and 
      stroke. Clinicians are often summoned to make challenging decisions for the 
      prevention and treatment of high risk patients with an unpredicted outcome, often 
      relying on data that are less than definitive. During the last decades, heparins 
      (unfractionated and low molecular weight heparins) as well as vitamin K 
      antagonists, such as warfarin, and indirect Xa inhibitors, such as fontaparinux, 
      are the cornerstone for the prevention and treatment of patients with venous 
      thromboembolism. However, the traditionally used anticoagulants have several 
      drawbacks that may limit their efficacy and use in every day clinical practise. 
      The newly developed oral anticoagulants, belonging to the categories of direct 
      thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) and direct Xa inhibitors, have emerged as promising 
      agents with remarkable efficacy, concentrating many parameters of an ideal 
      anticoagulant. Rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban are the most studied agents, 
      while a plethora of others are investigated in clinical trials of different 
      phases and are expected to reach the market in the following years. The purpose 
      of this review is to summarize the so far acquired knowledge on these agents, to 
      report briefly some of their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and 
      to focus on their role in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: VTE is a serious, but decreasing complication following major 
      orthopedic surgery. This guideline focuses on optimal prophylaxis to reduce 
      postoperative pulmonary embolism and DVT. METHODS: The methods of this guideline 
      follow those described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic 
      Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and 
      Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians 
      Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement. RESULTS: In 
      patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, we recommend the use of one of the 
      following rather than no antithrombotic prophylaxis: low-molecular-weight 
      heparin; fondaparinux; dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban (total hip arthroplasty 
      or total knee arthroplasty but not hip fracture surgery); low-dose unfractionated 
      heparin; adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist; aspirin (all Grade 1B); or an 
      intermittent pneumatic compression device (IPCD) (Grade 1C) for a minimum of 10 
      to 14 days. We suggest the use of low-molecular-weight heparin in preference to 
      the other agents we have recommended as alternatives (Grade 2C/2B), and in 
      patients receiving pharmacologic prophylaxis, we suggest adding an IPCD during 
      the hospital stay (Grade 2C). We suggest extending thromboprophylaxis for up to 
      35 days (Grade 2B). In patients at increased bleeding risk, we suggest an IPCD or 
      no prophylaxis (Grade 2C). In patients who decline injections, we recommend using 
      apixaban or dabigatran (all Grade 1B). We suggest against using inferior vena 
      cava filter placement for primary prevention in patients with contraindications 
      to both pharmacologic and mechanical thromboprophylaxis (Grade 2C). We recommend 
      against Doppler (or duplex) ultrasonography screening before hospital discharge 
      (Grade 1B). For patients with isolated lower-extremity injuries requiring leg 
      immobilization, we suggest no thromboprophylaxis (Grade 2B). For patients 
      undergoing knee arthroscopy without a history of VTE, we suggest no 
      thromboprophylaxis (Grade 2B). CONCLUSIONS: Optimal strategies for 
      thromboprophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery include pharmacologic and 
      mechanical approaches.

TI  - Reversing the anticoagulation effects of dabigatran.
PG  - 29-38
LID - 10.1080/21548331.2017.1298389 [doi]
AB  - The standard of care for oral anticoagulation therapy has primarily been 
      warfarin, which is limited by its indirect mechanism-of-action, variable 
      kinetics, tolerability, and routine monitoring concerns. The direct-acting oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) have predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, 
      and improved safety and efficacy compared to warfarin for the prevention of 
      stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and prevention or 
      management of venous thromboembolism. Consequential bleeding is a concern with 
      all anticoagulants. Vitamin K is not a rapid reversal agent for warfarin; rather 
      it facilitates synthesis of new vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which can 
      take longer than 24 h. Other nonspecific agents, including recombinant activated 
      factor VII, three- and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC), and 
      activated PCC or Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity (FEIBA®), are options 
      based on clinical need. Specific agents to quickly reverse the effects of DOACs 
      have been under development, and idarucizumab, a monoclonal antibody fragment 
      that rapidly binds dabigatran, has been approved for clinical use in cases of 
      dabigatran-related life-threatening bleeding, or if a dabigatran-treated patient 
      needs emergency surgery or an invasive procedure. Idarucizumab specifically and 
      rapidly reverses dabigatran-induced anticoagulation as measured by established 
      coagulation assays. However, this does not guarantee complete hemostasis, 
      especially if a patient has underlying comorbidities such as renal or liver 
      disease, or has experienced recent trauma that requires urgent surgery. In these 
      cases, concomitant supportive therapy and/or administration of concentrated 
      clotting factors may be considered. Emerging data from ongoing trials and 
      clinical experience will further inform providers regarding optimal approaches 
      for anticoagulation reversal.

TI  - Direct Oral to Parenteral Anticoagulants: Strategies for Inpatient Transition.
PG  - 32-40
LID - 10.1002/jcph.1694 [doi]
AB  - The primary objective of this study was to describe the impact on bleeding rates 
      of 2 different strategies for transitioning from a direct oral anticoagulant 
      (DOAC) to a parenteral anticoagulant: a delayed, clinically driven strategy 
      versus the standard per-package-insert strategy. This was a single-center 
      descriptive cohort study conducted at a large academic medical center. Included 
      patients were 18 years or older, admitted as an inpatient, and had received at 
      least 1 dose of a DOAC prior to initiation of therapeutic parenteral 
      anticoagulation. The primary end point was the incidence of major bleeds on the 
      transition from a DOAC to a parenteral anticoagulant via a standard versus an 
      intentionally delayed strategy. The secondary outcomes evaluated renal function, 
      reason for delay, DOAC anti-factor Xa concentration, international normalized 
      ratio values, blood product administration, and thrombotic complications. A total 
      of 300 patients were included. The primary end point of bleeding was higher in 
      the delayed group than the standard group, 25% and 12%, respectively (odds ratio, 
      0.39; P < .05). In both groups, patients who bled had a higher severity of 
      illness, a greater incidence of acute kidney injury, and, when available, higher 
      median DOAC anti-factor Xa concentrations. Despite a more conservative approach, 
      patients in the delayed group experienced more bleeding, most likely attributable 
      to a higher severity of illness, which highlights emerging challenges of 
      inpatient anticoagulation management. Further prospective studies analyzing DOAC 
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in acutely ill patients are warranted.

TI  - The Risk of Bleeding Complications in Intra-Articular Injections and 
      Arthrocentesis in Patients on Novel Oral Anticoagulants: A Systematic Review.
PG  - e17755

LID - e17755
AB  - Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are increasingly prescribed blood-thinning 
      medication. Surpassing Warfarin, NOACs are more favored and extensively used 
      in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, acute coronary syndrome, and in elderly 
      patients. Well-known benefits of novel oral anticoagulants include predictable 
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and shorter half-life. However, as with any 
      anticoagulant, there are bleeding risks with NOACs. There is a lack of evidence 
      and consensus on the management of novel anticoagulants for intraarticular 
      injections and arthrocentesis. This systematic review aims to analyze the risk of 
      bleeding complications in patients on novel oral anticoagulants who underwent 
      joint injections and arthrocentesis to help physicians in the decision-making and 
      consenting process. A literature search of three online databases was completed 
      using the Cochrane methodology for systematic reviews. Eligibility criteria 
      included any study that reported bleeding complication rates in adult patients on 
      novel oral anticoagulants that had a joint injection or aspiration whilst 
      continuing their regular oral anticoagulation. All studies with any number of 
      patients and published in any language were included. Review articles and 
      systematic reviews were excluded. The search of databases resulted in a total of 
      310 articles. After screening, a total of four articles were deemed suitable to 
      be included in the analysis. These described a total of 668 patients undergoing 
      injections/aspiration procedures with patients on three different novel oral 
      anticoagulants namely Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, and Dabigatran. Only one patient 
      joint had a bleeding complication and the patient was on Dabigatran. The results 
      of this systematic review show that it is relatively safe to perform joint 
      injections and arthrocentesis whilst continuing on Novel oral anticoagulation.

TI  - Antithrombotic Management of Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation and

      Clinical Practice Guidelines for Stroke.
PG  - 210-5
LID - 10.5853/jos.2015.17.2.210 [doi]
AB  - Cardioembolic stroke related to nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is associated 
      with a high recurrence rate and high mortality and morbidity. In this population, 
      therefore, optimal anticoagulant therapy is required to prevent the occurrence of 
      second stroke. Oral anticoagulant, warfarin has been traditionally used, but it 
      is greatly limited by its narrow efficacy window, complex pharmacokinetics, and 
      multiple drug interactions, thus requiring frequent blood monitoring. Recently, 
      oral anticoagulants targeted for a specific coagulation component have been newly 
      developed and tested in large clinical trials. Dabigatran, direct thrombin 
      inhibitor, and rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, inhibitors of factor Xa 
      harbor great merits of rapid action time, short half-life, stable plasma 
      concentration, and little drug interaction. Recently, large randomized clinical 
      trials and meta-analyses have been published to show the efficacy and safety of 
      the new oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin. Based on the results from 
      recent clinical trials, we revised recommendations to apply optimal anticoagulant 
      therapy in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and ischemic stroke or 
      transient ischemic attack.

BTI - Recommendations for Antithrombotic Agents for the Prevention of Stroke and 
      Systemic Embolism in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia associated with increased 
      morbidity and mortality. Patients with AF are at risk of stroke and systemic 
      embolism (SSE), which can cause death, disability, and impaired quality of life. 
      Antithrombotic therapies, such as oral anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs, can 
      reduce the risk for stroke and systemic thromboembolism and are recommended for 
      most AF patients with risk factors for stroke. The risk of stroke varies 
      considerably across patients; therefore, major guidelines recommend 
      antithrombotic therapy based on risk assessment, quantified using a validated 
      tool such as the CHADS(2) score. There are decades of experience with the use of 
      the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) warfarin, as well as compelling evidence of 
      efficacy with regard to stroke prevention. However, individualized dose 
      adjustments and laboratory monitoring are required, and warfarin remains a 
      frequent cause of drug-related emergency hospitalization in the elderly. New oral 
      anticoagulants (NOACs) may feature more predictable pharmacokinetics and dosing, 
      but there is less clinical experience outside of randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) with these drugs at the moment. These NOACs include the direct thrombin 
      inhibitor, dabigatran, and the direct factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and 
      apixaban, which have been approved for use for the prevention of SSE in patients 
      with AF. However, uncertainty remains regarding whether these agents show 
      increased real-world benefits compared with warfarin. Although considered less 
      effective at stroke prevention than anticoagulant therapy, antiplatelet agents 
      may nevertheless be an option for selected patients. The Canadian Agency for 
      Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) previously reviewed the clinical 
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the NOACs compared with warfarin. At that 
      time, apixaban was not approved for use in Canada, and was therefore not included 
      in the Canadian Drug Expert Committee (CDEC) recommendation; in addition, 
      antiplatelet drugs were not included. The current review was undertaken to allow 
      the development of recommendations that include all the NOACs as well as the 
      antiplatelet agents, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and clopidogrel.

AB  - Oral anticoagulants (OAs) are the recommended drugs to prevent cardiovascular 
      events and recurrence in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and cardioembolic 
      stroke. We conducted a literature search to review the current state of OAs 
      pharmacogenomics, focusing on Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAs) in patients 
      treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). 
      VKAs: Warfarin, acenocoumarol, fluindione and phenprocoumon have long been used, 
      but their interindividual variability and narrow therapeutic/safety ratio makes 
      their dosage difficult. GWAs have been useful in finding genetic variants 
      associated with VKAs response. The main genes involved in VKAs pharmacogenetics 
      are: VKORC1, CYP2C19 and CYP4F2. Variants in these genes have been included in 
      pharmacogenetic algorithms to predict the VKAs dose individually in each patient 
      depending on their genotype and clinical variables. DOACs: Dabigatran, apixaban, 
      rivaroxaban and edoxaban have been approved for patients with AF. They have 
      stable pharmacokinetics and do not require routine blood checks, thus avoiding 
      most of the drawbacks of VKAs. Except for a GWAs performed in patients treated 
      with dabigatran, there is no Genome Wide pharmacogenomics data for DOACs. 
      Pharmacogenomics could be useful to predict the better clinical response and 
      avoid adverse events in patients treated with anticoagulants, identifying the 
      most appropriate anticoagulant drug for each patient. Current pharmacogenomics 
      data show that the polymorphisms affecting VKAs or DOACs are different, 
      concluding that personalized medicine based on pharmacogenomics could be 
      possible. However, more studies are required to implement personalized medicine 
      in clinical practice with OA and based on pharmacogenetics of DOACs.

TI  - Practical management of patients on apixaban: a consensus guide.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1186/1477-9560-11-27 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common tachyarrhythmia in Australia, 
      with a prevalence over 10% in older patients. AF is the leading preventable cause 
      of ischaemic stroke, and strokes due to AF have a higher mortality and morbidity. 
      Stroke prevention is therefore a key management strategy for AF patients, in 
      addition to rate and rhythm control. Anticoagulation with warfarin has been an 
      enduring gold standard for stroke prevention in NVAF patients. In Australia, 
      three novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban are 
      now approved and reimbursed for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular 
      AF (NVAF). International European Cardiology guidelines now recommend either a 
      NOAC or warfarin for NVAF patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2, unless 
      contraindicated. Apixaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor with a 12-hour 
      half-life and 25% renal excretion that was found in a large trial of NVAF 
      patients to be superior to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism. In 
      this trial population, apixaban also resulted in less bleeding and a lower 
      mortality rate than warfarin. METHODS: Clinical experience with apixaban outside 
      of clinical trials has been limited, and there is currently little evidence to 
      guide the management of bleeding or invasive procedures in patients taking 
      apixaban. The relevant currently available animal and ex vivo human data were 
      collected, analyzed and summarized. RESULTS: This multi-disciplinary consensus 
      statement has been written to serve as a guide for healthcare practitioners 
      prescribing apixaban in Australia, with a focus on acute and emergency 
      management. CONCLUSIONS: The predictable pharmacokinetics and minimal drug 
      interactions of apixaban should allow for safe anticoagulation in the majority of 
      patients, including temporary interruption for elective procedures. In the 
      absence of published data, patients actively bleeding on apixaban should receive 
      standard supportive treatment. Quantitative assays of apixaban level such as 
      chromogenic anti-Xa assays are becoming available but their utility is unproven 
      in this setting. Specific antidotes for novel anticoagulants, including apixaban, 
      are in clinical development.

AB  - The need for therapeutic drug monitoring of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) 
      remains an area of clinical equipoise. Although routine monitoring may be 
      unnecessary given predictable pharmacokinetics in most patients, there may be 
      altered pharmacokinetics in those with end organ dysfunction, such as those with 
      renal impairment, or with concomitant interacting medications, at extremes of 
      body weight or age, or in those with thromboembolic events in atypical locations. 
      We aimed to assess real-world practices in situations in which DOAC drug-level 
      monitoring was used at a large academic medical center. A retrospective review of 
      the records of patients who had a DOAC drug-specific activity level checked from 
      2016 to 2019 was included. A total of 119 patients had 144 DOAC measurements 
      (apixaban (n = 62) and rivaroxaban (n = 57)). Drug-specific calibrated DOAC 
      levels were within an expected therapeutic range for 110 levels(76%), with 21 
      levels (15%) above the expected range and 13 levels (9%) below the expected 
      range. The DOAC levels were checked in the setting of an urgent or emergent 
      procedure in 28 patients (24%), followed by renal failure in 17 patients (14%), a 
      bleeding event in 11 patients (9%), concern for recurrent thromboembolism in 10 
      patients (8%), thrombophilia in 9 patients (8%), a history of recurrent 
      thromboembolism in 6 patients (5%), extremes of body weight in 7 patients (5%), 
      and unknown reasons in 7 patients (5%). Clinical decision making was infrequently 
      affected by the DOAC monitoring. Therapeutic drug monitoring with DOACs may help 
      predict bleeding events in elderly patients, those with impaired renal function, 
      and in the event of an emergent or urgent procedure. Future studies are needed to 
      target the select patient-specific scenarios where monitoring DOAC levels may 
      impact clinical outcomes.

TI  - Impact of Polypharmacy and P-Glycoprotein- and CYP3A4-Modulating Drugs on Safety 
      and Efficacy of Oral Anticoagulation Therapy in Patients with Atrial 
      Fibrillation.
PG  - 615-623

AB  - PURPOSE: To study whether polypharmacy or drug-drug interactions have 
      differential effect on safety and efficacy in patients treated with direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs) versus warfarin. METHODS: We performed a systematic review 
      and meta-analysis of studies that randomized patients with atrial fibrillation to 
      DOACs or warfarin stratified by the number of concomitant drugs. Outcomes 
      included stroke or systemic embolism (SE), all-cause mortality, major bleeding, 
      and intracranial hemorrhage. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated and Mantel-Haenszel 
      random effects were applied. RESULTS: Two high-quality studies were eligible, 
      including 32,465 participants who received apixaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin, 
      with a median follow-up of 1.9 years. Of participants, 29% used < 5 drugs, 55% 
      used 5-9 drugs, and 16% used ≥ 10 drugs. Drugs interacting with DOACs 
      (P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4) were used by 6460 (20%) of patients. Patients with higher 
      number of drugs (0-4 vs 5-9 vs ≥ 10) had higher rates of mortality (5.8%, 7.9%, 
      10.0%) and major bleeding (3.4%, 4.8%, 7.7%). Comparative efficacy or safety of 
      DOACs versus warfarin was not affected by polypharmacy status or 
      P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4 inhibitor use. However, the presence of polypharmacy 
      (p = 0.001) or glycoprotein/CYP3A4-modulating drugs (p = 0.03) was correlated 
      with increased risk of major bleeding when compared with warfarin. Overall, DOAC 
      use was associated with a lower risk of stroke/SE (RR, 0.84; 95%CI, 0.74-0.94), 
      all-cause mortality (RR, 0.91; 95%CI, 0.84-0.98), and intracranial hemorrhage 
      (RR, 0.51; 95%CI, 0.38-0.70) compared with warfarin. CONCLUSIONS: DOACs were more 
      effective than warfarin, and at least as safe. Polypharmacy was associated with 
      adverse outcomes and attenuated the advantage in risk of major bleeding among 
      rivaroxaban users, particularly in the presence of 
      P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4-modulating drugs.

TI  - Methods to Correct Drug-Induced Coagulopathy in Bleeding Emergencies: A 
      Comparative Review.
PG  - 336-343
LID - 10.1093/labmed/lmab115 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy have become increasingly 
      popular. The goal of therapy is to prevent venous thromboembolism and platelet 
      aggregation, respectively. Traditional anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs are 
      quickly being replaced with novel medications with more predictable 
      pharmacokinetics. Unfortunately, these drugs carry the risk of uncontrolled 
      hemorrhage because of drug-induced coagulopathy. Uncontrolled hemorrhage 
      continues to be a major cause of preventable death: hemorrhage accounts for 
      approximately 30% of trauma-related deaths, second to brain injury. Controlling 
      hemorrhage while dealing with comorbidities remains a challenge to clinicians. 
      There are many gaps in care and knowledge that contribute to the struggle of 
      treating this patient population. METHODS: This literature review is focused on 
      the most effective ways to achieve hemostasis in a patient with drug-induced 
      coagulopathy. The antiplatelet therapies aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, 
      pasugrel, and ticagrelor are analyzed. Anticoagulant therapies are also reviewed, 
      including warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran. In addition, 
      viscoelastic testing and platelet function assays are reviewed for their ability 
      to monitor drug effectiveness and to accurately depict the patient's ability to 
      clot. This review focuses on articles from the past 10 years. However, there are 
      limitations to the 10-year restriction, including no new research posted within 
      the 10-year timeline on particular subjects. The most recent article was then 
      used where current literature did not exist (within 10 years). RESULTS: 
      Traditional anticoagulants have unpredictable pharmacokinetics and can be 
      difficult to correct in bleeding emergencies. Vitamin K has been proven to 
      reliably and effectively reverse the effect of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) while 
      having a lower anaphylactoid risk than frozen plasma. Prothrombin complex 
      concentrates should be used when there is risk of loss of life or limb. Frozen 
      plasma is not recommended as a first-line treatment for the reversal of VKAs. 
      Novel anticoagulants have specific reversal agents such as idarucizumab for 
      dabigatran and andexxa alfa for factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors. Although reliable, 
      these drugs carry a large price tag. As with traditional anticoagulants, cheaper 
      alternative therapies are available such as prothrombin complex concentrates. 
      Finally, static coagulation testing works well for routine therapeutic drug 
      monitoring but may not be appropriate during bleeding emergencies. Viscoelastic 
      testing such as thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry depict in 
      vivo hemostatic properties more accurately than static coagulation assays. Adding 
      viscoelastic testing into resuscitation protocols may guide blood product usage 
      more efficiently. CONCLUSION: This review is intended to be used as a guide. The 
      topics covered in this review should be used as a reference for treating the 
      conditions described. This review article also covers laboratory testing and is 
      meant as a guide for physicians on best practices. These findings illustrate 
      recommended testing and reversal techniques based off evidence-based medicine and 
      literature.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly occurring arrhythmia, and is a 
      condition of both significant clinical and economic importance. An antithrombotic 
      agent is considered mandatory as part of the management in most patients with AF. 
      It has been conclusively demonstrated that long-term anticoagulation therapy can 
      significantly reduce the risk of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF. While 
      vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin are highly effective, they possess 
      numerous limitations that curtail their use, or make their use challenging for 
      clinicians and patients. A new generation of anticoagulants are being 
      investigated in phase III clinical trials in patients with AF. One or more of 
      these agents have the potential to either replace or act as alternatives to VKA 
      therapy in AF. This group includes the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, the 
      direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, and finally, the 
      vitamin K analogue, tecarfarin. Additional agents are being developed in phase I 
      or II clinical trials. The direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors are generally 
      small, synthetic molecules with predictable pharmacokinetics, a predictable 
      pharmacodynamic effect, few drug interactions and do not require routine 
      therapeutic drug monitoring. These new anticoagulants may well represent a new 
      era in anticoagulation. However, they do possess their own limitations and will 
      present new challenges for clinicians.

AB  - Thromboembolic diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality 
      worldwide. For a long time, heparin and Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) drugs were 
      used for treatment and prophylaxis of the thromboembolic diseases. The 
      development of newer direct and novel oral anticoagulant medications 
      (DOACs/NOACs) has changed clinical practice significantly. Lesser monitoring, 
      ease with dosing, less drug interactions have made these drugs useful to the 
      providers and the patients. But these drugs have bleeding as a side effect. There 
      is ongoing research on the specific antidotes of these anticoagulants in case of 
      life-threatening bleeding. Though the use of the DOACs and NOACs have increased, 
      there is still not enough clinical evidence about the specific antidotes of these 
      medications. Unlike heparin or VKA, reversal of life-threatening bleeding in the 
      setting of DOAC use is still a clinical challenge. We need more data on the dose, 
      pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy of those antidotes. Authors have reviewed 
      articles on DOACs and their antidotes in Pubmed and also in the clinical trial 
      website. Specific antidotes including Idarucizumab for Dabigatran, Andexanet alfa 
      for factor Xa inhibitors are being used to reverse the actions of the 
      anticoagulants. Ciraparantag is a universal antidote for the DOACs, which is 
      still under investigation. FXaI16L is currently being investigated as a potential 
      universal antidote for multiple anticoagulants, including dabigatran and 
      rivaroxaban. Though mostly safe, the use of DOACs can still carry a risk of 
      severe bleeding in patients. More data on the use of the antidotes is required to 
      reverse the side effect of DOACs if clinically indicated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to examine the management strategies 
      for pulmonary embolism (PE) with an emphasis of the role of direct oral 
      anticoagulants (DOACs). METHODS: PubMed was searched to identify relevant journal 
      articles published through April 2017. Additional references were obtained from 
      articles discovered during the database search. RESULTS: Initial heparinization 
      followed by long-term anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists has been 
      considered the mainstay for the treatment of PE. However, DOACs now offer 
      comparably effective and potentially safer alternatives for both acute and 
      long-term treatment of PE using a monotherapy approach without the need for 
      initial heparinization for rivaroxaban or apixaban. Advantages to using DOACs 
      include oral availability, rapid onset of action, minimal drug and food 
      interactions, predictable pharmacokinetics, and lack of need for routine 
      monitoring. Limitations of using these agents include a limited availability of 
      assays to quickly and efficiently measure their anticoagulant effects and the 
      lack of widely available reversal agents for the direct oral factor Xa 
      inhibitors; although idarucizumab has recently been approved for the reversal of 
      dabigatran's anticoagulant effects. CONCLUSIONS: Advantages to using DOACs render 
      them an attractive alternative to conventional therapy in PE treatment that may 
      simplify acute and long-term treatment paradigms, improve patient outcomes, and 
      increase patient compliance. However, questions remain pertaining to the use of 
      DOACs in PE patients with high-risk features and in cancer patients and fragile 
      populations. Clinical studies are under way to address many of these issues.

TI  - Sustained safe and effective anticoagulation using Edoxaban via percutaneous 
      endoscopic gastrostomy.
PG  - 884-888
LID - 10.1002/ehf2.12434 [doi]
AB  - Extensive data support the safety of direct oral anticoagulants compared with 
      vitamin K antagonists in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, leading 
      to a significantly increase in the use of these compounds in clinical practice. 
      However, there is no compelling evidence supporting the use of direct oral 
      anticoagulant in individuals who are intubated or have a percutaneous endoscopic 
      gastrostomy (PEG): patients with several co-morbidities are underrepresented in 
      clinical trials, so the best long-term strategy for anticoagulation is difficult 
      to ascertain. The aim of the present report was to evaluate the safety and 
      efficacy of edoxaban administered via PEG in a patient with heart failure and a 
      history of atrial fibrillation affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A 
      71-year-old man with atrial fibrillation, advanced ALS, type II diabetes 
      mellitus, and hypertension presented to the emergency department with dyspnoea 
      and tachycardia. Because vitamin K antagonist and rivaroxaban 15 mg were dropped 
      because of difficult international normalized ratio control (time in therapeutic 
      range <30%) and severe haematuria, respectively, edoxaban 30 mg (crushed pill) 
      daily was administered based on the patient's weight of 58 kg. Mean edoxaban 
      plasma concentration-time profiles were measured, as anti-Xa activity, 2 h before 
      and at 2, 6, and 22 h after drug administration and then compared with the 
      pharmacokinetic profile of edoxaban 30 mg in healthy subjects. An additional 
      testing of steady-state peak plasma concentration of edoxaban after 10 days and a 
      30 day follow-up were evaluated. The values of the pharmacokinetic parameters, 
      analysed with a non-compartmental analysis by PKSolver module, showed that C(max) 
      and AUC(0→t) were only slightly higher than those observed in healthy subjects, 
      while the half-life and observed clearance were significantly longer and lower, 
      respectively, than in normal subjects. Steady-state peak plasma concentration of 
      edoxaban was very similar to the levels reported in healthy subjects, and neither 
      relevant bleeding nor thromboembolic event was reported at a 30 day follow-up. 
      These results support safe and effective anticoagulation with edoxaban 30 mg but 
      suggest caution with the use of full dose of edoxaban (60 mg daily) in this kind 
      of patients. We report, for the first time, a safe and effective anticoagulation 
      based on the administration of edoxaban 30 mg daily through PEG in a patient with 
      advanced ALS, acute respiratory, and heart failure, presenting with Takotsubo 
      syndrome and atrial fibrillation.

TI  - Novel Thiourea and Oxime Ether Isosteviol-Based Anticoagulants: MD Simulation and 
      ADMET Prediction.
LID - 10.3390/ph17020163 [doi]
LID - 163
AB  - Activated blood coagulation factor X (FXa) plays a critical initiation step of 
      the blood-coagulation pathway and is considered a desirable target for 
      anticoagulant drug development. It is reversibly inhibited by nonvitamin K 
      antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, 
      and rivaroxaban. Thrombosis is extremely common and is one of the leading causes 
      of death in developed countries. In previous studies, novel thiourea and oxime 
      ether isosteviol derivatives as FXa inhibitors were designed through a 
      combination of QSAR studies and molecular docking. In the present contribution, 
      molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for 100 ns to assess binding 
      structures previously predicted by docking and furnish additional information. 
      Moreover, three thiourea- and six oxime ether-designed isosteviol analogs were 
      then examined for their drug-like and ADMET properties. MD simulations 
      demonstrated that four out of the nine investigated isosteviol derivatives, i.e., 
      one thiourea and three oxime ether ISV analogs, form stable complexes with FXa. 
      These derivatives interact with FXa in a manner similar to Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA)-approved drugs like edoxaban and betrixaban, indicating 
      their potential to inhibit factor Xa activity. One of these derivatives, E24, 
      displays favorable pharmacokinetic properties, positioning it as the most 
      promising drug candidate. This, along with the other three derivatives, can 
      undergo further chemical synthesis and bioassessment.

AB  - Use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), including dabigatran 
      etexilate, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban or betrixaban provides a safe and 
      convenient alternative to the traditional anticoagulation with vitamin K 
      antagonists or heparin derivatives. Many patients receiving long-term seizure 
      prophylaxis with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may require anticoagulation with 
      NOACs. Providers caring for these patients need to be informed about potential 
      interactions between AEDs and NOACs and the relevant clinical consequences. A 
      systematic review of the existing literature was conducted to elucidate current 
      knowledge on the clinically relevant interactions between AEDs and NOACs and 
      highlight areas in which further research is needed. The systematic review 
      protocol was developed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
      and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance. Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library 
      and SciFinder were searched. Of the 630 non-duplicate items identified by the 
      search, 13 met eligibility criteria. These 13 items included 8 case reports, 2 
      letters to the editor and 3 nonrandomized studies. The majority of 
      pharmacokinetic interactions between NOACs and first generation AEDs occurred via 
      the induction of the hepatic enzyme system and competition for the P-glycoprotein 
      transporter and lead to decreased NOAC plasma levels and consequent thrombotic 
      events. Only one article, a case report, was identified that focused on 
      interactions between the second generation AED and a NOAC. At the present time, 
      the limited evidence suggests that enzyme-inducing or inhibiting AEDs reduce the 
      effectiveness of anticoagulation produced by several NOACs. This information may 
      help providers anticipate possible interactions and guide therapy appropriately.

TI  - Developing a management plan for oral anticoagulant reversal.
PG  - S21-31
LID - 10.2146/ajhp130042 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe a process for prompt evaluation and management- including 
      reversal of the effects of warfarin and target-specific oral anticoagulants-of 
      patients with or at high risk for bleeding during oral anticoagulant therapy or 
      when such therapy is interrupted for an urgent invasive procedure or surgery. 
      SUMMARY: The use of pharmacologic interventions for anticoagulant reversal may 
      depend on the measured level of anticoagulation, time since the last 
      anticoagulant dose, target level of coagulation, reliability of laboratory tests 
      of coagulation, severity of or risk for bleeding, the agents' mechanism of action 
      and pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the reversal agent. The patient's 
      age, weight, renal function, comorbid conditions, and other drug therapy, as well 
      as the risk for thromboembolism and other adverse effects of the reversal 
      therapies, also enter into therapeutic decisions. Hemodialysis may be used to 
      remove the direct thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitor dabigatran and reverse its 
      anticoagulant effects. Limited experience with clotting factor concentrates 
      suggests that activated prothrombin complex concentrate may be useful for 
      reversing the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. The activity of oral factor Xa 
      inhibitors (i.e., rivaroxaban and apixaban) is higher up the common pathway of 
      the coagulation cascade and thus may be easier to reverse than that of direct 
      thrombin inhibitors. Additional clinical experience is needed to identify the 
      optimal reversal agents, dosage, and impact on thrombosis or bleeding outcomes 
      for both classes of agents. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive plan individualized to 
      each agent should be developed to promptly reverse the effects of oral 
      anticoagulants and optimize outcomes in patients with bleeding or an urgent need 
      for surgery.

TI  - Amiodarone, Verapamil, or Diltiazem Use With Direct Oral Anticoagulants and the 
      Risk of Hemorrhage in Older Adults.
PG  - 315-323
LID - 10.1016/j.cjco.2021.11.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Routinely used cardiac medications, based on pharmacokinetics, are 
      hypothesized to increase drug levels of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), with 
      the potential to increase the risk of hemorrhage. We set out to compare the risk 
      for hemorrhage following initiation of amiodarone, verapamil, or diltiazem 
      (moderate cytochrome P450 3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein activity) vs metoprolol or 
      amlodipine (weak or no activity), among older adults prescribed DOACs. METHODS: 
      We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of all adults (aged ≥ 
      66 years) on a DOAC (dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban; n = 295,038) who were 
      newly prescribed amiodarone (n = 4872), verapamil (n = 1284), or diltiazem (n = 
      14,638), compared with metoprolol or amlodipine, from Ontario, Canada 
      (2009-2016). The outcome was hospital admission or emergency room visit with a 
      major hemorrhage (upper or lower gastrointestinal tract, intracranial), examined 
      using weighted models. RESULTS: A total of 1737 hemorrhage events occurred 
      (amiodarone, 80 [1.6%] vs metoprolol 503 [2.3%]; verapamil, 32 [2.5%] vs 
      amlodipine, 406 [1.6%]; diltiazem, 312 [2.1%] vs amlodipine, 404 [1.5%]). The 
      weighted risk of major hemorrhage was not elevated with amiodarone, verapamil, or 
      diltiazem initiation in DOAC users, compared to metoprolol or amlodipine, during 
      the full follow-up period (hazard ratio [HR; 95% confidence interval]: amiodarone 
      HR 0.77 [0.61-0.97]; verapamil HR 1.32 [0.88-1.98]; diltiazem HR 0.99 
      [0.85-1.15]). This finding was consistent with a broader definition of bleeding, 
      adjusting for kidney function, by DOAC type or dosage. CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhage 
      risk with amiodarone, verapamil, and diltiazem was similar to that with 
      comparators, among DOAC users aged > 66 years.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Elderly population is known to be associated with polymedication, 
      comorbidities and altered drug pharmacokinetics. However, the most adequate oral 
      anticoagulant, attending to its relative efficacy and safety, remains unclear. 
      METHODS: We searched for phase III randomized controlled trials (MEDLINE, 
      Cochrane Library, SciELO collection and Web of Science) comparing novel 
      non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) with Vitamin K antagonists 
      (VKA) in the elderly population (≥75 years-old) in atrial fibrillation (AF). Risk 
      ratios (RR) were calculated using a random effects model. Trial sequential 
      analysis (TSA) was performed in statistically significant results to evaluate 
      whether cumulative sample size was powered. RESULTS: Four trials rendered data 
      about elderly (≥75 years-old) and younger patients (<75 years-old) with AF. NOACs 
      demonstrated a 30% significant risk reduction (RR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.80) in 
      elderly patients compared to VKA, without heterogeneity across studies 
      (I(2) = 0%). The TSA showed that cumulative evidence of this subgroup exceeded 
      the minimum information size required for the risk reduction. In younger 
      patients, VKA and NOACs shared a similar risk of stroke and systemic embolism (RR 
      0.97, 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.18). Regarding major bleeding risk in the elderly, the 
      overall comparative risk of NOACs was not different from VKA (RR 0.91, 95% CI: 
      0.72 to 1.16; I(2) = 86%). CONCLUSIONS: NOACs reduce significantly the risk of 
      stroke and systemic embolism in elderly patients without increasing major 
      bleeding events. The dimension of stroke risk reduction was significantly higher 
      in the elderly than in younger adults.

TI  - Comparison of phenprocoumon with direct oral anticoagulants in catheter ablation 
      of atrial fibrillation.
PG  - oead065
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oead065 [doi]
LID - oead065
AB  - AIMS: In patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF), 
      direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are as effective and safe as the vitamin K 
      antagonist (VKA) warfarin. Phenprocoumon has a different pharmacokinetic profile 
      compared with warfarin and is the most used VKA in Germany. The aim of the study 
      was to compare DOAC with phenprocoumon. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this 
      retrospective single-centre cohort study, 1735 patients who underwent 2219 
      consecutive catheter ablations for AF between January 2011 and May 2017 were 
      included. All patients were in-hospital for at least 48 h after catheter 
      ablation. The primary outcome was defined as peri-procedural thrombo-embolic 
      events. The secondary outcome was any bleeding according to the International 
      Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH). The mean age of the patients was 
      63.3 years. Phenprocoumon was prescribed in 929 (42%) of the cases, and in 697 
      (31%) dabigatran, 399 (18%) rivaroxaban, and 194 (9%) apixaban. During 
      hospitalization, 37 (1.6%) thrombo-embolic events occurred, including 23 
      transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs). Compared with the use of phenoprocoumon, the 
      use of DOAC was significantly associated with a lower thrombo-embolic risk [16 
      (1.2%) vs. 21 (2.2%), odds ratio (OR)], 0.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 
      0.2-0.9], P = 0.04. No statistically significant association with bleeding risk 
      was observed [phenprocomoun: 122 (13%); DOAC: 163 (12.6%); OR 0.9 (95% CI 
      0.7-1.2); P = 0.70]. Interruption of oral anticoagulation (OAC) was associated 
      with an increased risk for thrombo-embolic complications [OR 2.2 (1.1-4.3); P = 
      0.031], and bleeding [OR 2.5 (95% CI 1.8-3.2), P = 0.001]. CONCLUSION: In 
      patients undergoing catheter ablation for AF, the use of DOAC was associated with 
      a reduced risk of thrombo-embolic events compared with phenprocoumon. 
      Non-interrupted oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy was associated with a reduced 
      risk of peri-procedural thrombo-embolic and any bleeding complications.

TI  - Betrixaban for Extended Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in High-Risk 
      Hospitalized Patients: Putting the APEX Results into Practice.
PG  - 291-302
LID - 10.1007/s40265-019-1059-y [doi]
AB  - Acutely ill hospitalized medical patients remain at high thromboembolic risk for 
      several weeks after discharge. Previous trials with extended-duration 
      thromboprophylaxis using enoxaparin, apixaban, and rivaroxaban failed to achieve 
      acceptable net clinical benefit, largely due to excess of major bleeding. 
      Betrixaban is a novel factor Xa inhibitor with unique pharmacokinetic properties, 
      including low renal clearance, long half-life, and low peak-to-trough ratio. The 
      phase III APEX trial (N = 7513) compared a betrixaban 160 mg loading dose 
      followed by 80 mg once daily for 35-42 days, with enoxaparin 40 mg once daily for 
      6-14 days; the betrixaban dose was reduced for renal impairment or a concomitant 
      strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor. The primary efficacy endpoint of 
      composite thrombotic events was not different between treatment arms in cohort 1 
      (D-dimer ≥ 2 × upper limit of normal). Subsequent exploratory analyses showed a 
      statistically significant difference favoring betrixaban for symptomatic venous 
      thromboembolism and net clinical benefit in the overall population. For the 
      primary safety outcome, betrixaban did not significantly increase major bleeding 
      compared with enoxaparin. Based on available data from the APEX trial and 
      subanalyses, the use of betrixaban in patients similar to those enrolled in the 
      APEX trial can reduce the risk of thromboembolic events without increasing the 
      risk of major bleeding. Patients who may benefit more from betrixaban therapy 
      include those with elevated D-dimer, history of venous thromboembolism, 
      hospitalized for ischemic stroke, hospitalized for heart failure with N-terminal 
      pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ≥ 1975 ng/L, or two or more VTE risk factors. 
      Reduced-dose betrixaban does not appear to provide the same clinical utility as 
      full-dose betrixaban.

TI  - Development of Trypsin-Like Serine Protease Inhibitors as Therapeutic Agents: 
      Opportunities, Challenges, and their Unique Structure-Based Rationales.
PG  - 1506-29
AB  - There has been a revolution in the development of effective, small-molecule 
      anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. Numerous trypsin-like serine proteases 
      have been under active pursuit as therapeutic targets. Important examples include 
      thrombin, factor VIIa, factor Xa, and β-tryptase with indications ranging from 
      thrombosis and inflammation to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD). Trypsin-like serine proteases exhibit a highly similar tertiary folding 
      pattern, especially for the region near the substrate binding pocket that 
      includes the conserved catalytic triad consisting of histidine 57, aspartic acid 
      102, and serine 195. A rich collection of X-ray structures for many trypsin-like 
      serine proteases is available, which greatly facilitated the optimization of 
      small organic inhibitors as therapeutic agents. The present review surveyed those 
      inhibitors disclosed in peer-reviewed scientific journals and patent publications 
      with a special focus on structural features and protein-inhibitor interactions 
      that implicated the inhibitor optimization process. The role played by the 
      residue 190 of trypsin-like serine proteases is critical. While many inhibitors 
      without a basic group have progressed into the clinic for ones with alanine 190, 
      the task for those with serine 190 remains extremely challenging, if not 
      impossible. In addition to warfarin, heparin, and low molecular weight heparins 
      (LMWHs), treatment options have expanded with the development and approval of the 
      new oral anticoagulants (NOACs). The NOACs are superior to vitamin K antagonists 
      in terms of rapid onset, pharmacokinetics, drug/food interactions, and regular 
      coagulation monitoring; but one serious drawback is the lack of an effective 
      antidote at this time. Apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and edoxaban 
      (Savaysa) are the new Xa inhibitors that have been recently approved by the U.S. 
      FDA and are in current clinical practice. These drugs bind to the active site of 
      factor Xa (fXa) which prevents the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. In 
      addition, dabigatran etexikate (Pradaxa), the direct thrombin inhibitor (fIIa) is 
      also now widely prescribed.

TI  - Practical use of dabigatran etexilate for stroke prevention in atrial 
      fibrillation.
PG  - 516-26
LID - 10.1111/ijcp.12147 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, 
      and is the most prevalent factor for cardioembolic stroke. Vitamin K antagonists 
      (VKAs) have been the standard of care for stroke prevention in patients with AF 
      since the early 1990s. They are very effective for the prevention of 
      cardioembolic stroke, but are limited by factors such as drug-drug interactions, 
      food interactions, slow onset and offset of action, haemorrhage and need for 
      routine anticoagulation monitoring to maintain a therapeutic international 
      normalised ratio (INR). Multiple new oral anticoagulants have been developed as 
      potential replacements for VKAs for stroke prevention in AF. Most are small 
      synthetic molecules that target thrombin (e.g. dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa 
      (e.g. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban, YM150). These drugs have 
      predictable pharmacokinetics that allow fixed dosing without routine laboratory 
      monitoring. Dabigatran etexilate, the first of these new oral anticoagulants to 
      be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European 
      Medicines Agency for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF, 
      represents an effective and safe alternative to VKAs. Under the auspices of the 
      Regional Anticoagulation Working Group, a multidisciplinary group of experts in 
      thrombosis and haemostasis from Central and Eastern Europe, an expert panel with 
      expertise in AF convened to discuss practical, clinically important issues 
      related to the long-term use of dabigatran for stroke prevention in non-valvular 
      AF. The practical information reviewed in this article will help clinicians make 
      appropriate use of this new therapeutic option in daily clinical practice.

TI  - Characterization of a novel selective factor Xa inhibitor, DJT06001, which 
      reduces thrombus formation with low risk of bleeding.

AB  - Factor Xa (FXa) is a serine protease that plays key roles in linking the 
      intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways to the final common pathway. 
      DJT06001 is an oral, highly specific and direct FXa inhibitor for the prevention 
      and treatment of thromboembolic diseases. We characterized the compound in vitro 
      and studied its in vivo activity in rat thrombosis models, as well as bleeding 
      risk and Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) relationship. DJT06001 
      inhibited free FXa with an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 0.99 nM, and exhibited 
      >10000-fold selectivity for FXa than for other related serine proteases. DJT06001 
      concentration-dependently inhibited FXa activity in the prothrombinase complex 
      with an IC(50) of 2.53 nM. The concentrations for DJT06001 to double the 
      prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were 0.74 
      and 0.57 μM, respectively. Importantly, DJT06001 did not impair platelet 
      aggregation induced by ADP, platelet activating factor (PAF) and collagen. 
      Furthermore, DJT06001 inhibited thrombus formation in rat thrombosis models in a 
      dose dependent manner. And in rat tail bleeding risk test, it caused less 
      bleeding than rivaroxaban at doses that achieve the same antithrombotic effect. 
      PK/PD studies further demonstrated that there was a good correlation between the 
      plasma concentrations of DJT06001and its inhibition of plasma FXa activity and 
      prolongation of PT. In conclusion, DJT06001 was shown to be a potent and specific 
      FXa inhibitor with excellent PK/PD profiles and it could be developed as a new 
      anticoagulant for the management of thromboembolic diseases.

TI  - Impact of Direction of Transport on the Evaluation of Substrate Recognition of 
      Mouse Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion Protein 1.
PG  - 583-590
LID - 10.1124/dmd.122.001115 [doi]
AB  - Multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE/SLC47A) secretes metabolites and 
      xenobiotics into the urine in the proximal tubules of the kidney. Uptake assays 
      have been commonly used for evaluating MATE-mediated transport of new chemical 
      entities in drug development. The purpose of this study was to examine the 
      relationship between in vitro uptake activities by MATEs and the impact of 
      MATE-mediated transport in in vivo renal secretion. In vitro uptake in mouse 
      Mate1 (mMate1)-expressing human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and several 
      in vivo parameters from mMate1 knockout and wild-type mice were compared using 
      nine cationic compounds (almotriptan, naratriptan, talinolol, sumatriptan, 
      alogliptin, sitagliptin, rivaroxaban, saxagliptin, and vildagliptin). Compounds 
      that showed statistically significant decrease in secretory clearances with 
      respect to kidney concentrations (CL(R,kidney)) in mMate1 knockout mice were 
      categorized as in vivo substrates in this study. A good correlation (R(2) = 
      0.637) was observed between the in vitro uptake ratio and the in vivo ratio of 
      CL(R,kidney) of mMate1 knockout mice and wild-type mice. This study supported the 
      rationale of using an uptake assay to determine whether investigational compounds 
      are the substrate of MATEs and to predict drug-drug interaction risk via renal 
      secretion by MATE from the viewpoint of drug development in pharmaceutical 
      companies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We revealed that substrates judged by in vitro 
      experiments using mouse multidrug and toxin extrusion (mMate)1-expressing cells 
      were excreted in urine via mMate1 in vivo, and a good correlation (R(2) = 0.637) 
      was observed between in vitro uptake ratio and in vivo ratio of secretory 
      clearance with respect to the kidney concentrations (CL(R,kidney)) of mMate1 
      knockout and wild-type mice. This study supported the rationale of using an 
      uptake assay to predict potential human MATE1-mediated drug-drug interaction as a 
      victim.

AB  - Data on drug-drug interactions (DDI) of antineoplastic drugs with anticoagulants 
      is scarce. We aim to evaluate factors associated with DDI of antineoplastic and 
      supportive care drugs with anticoagulants resulting in modification of 
      pharmacokinetics of these last mentioned. A literature review on DDI databases 
      and summaries of products characteristics (SmPC) was done. Drug-drug interactions 
      of 257 antineoplastic and supportive care drugs with direct oral anticoagulants 
      (DOACs), warfarin, enoxaparin, or fondaparinux were categorized as no clinically 
      significant expected DDI, potentially weak DDI, potentially clinically 
      significant DDI, and recommendation against coadministration. Logistic regression 
      models were performed to analyze the association between the dependent variable 
      potentially clinically significant interaction/recommendation against 
      coadministration and the mechanisms of DDI. Of the 1799 associations, 84.4% were 
      absence of DDI, 3.6% potentially weak DDI, 10.2% potentially clinically relevant 
      DDI, and 2.0% recommendation against coadministration. Warfarin has higher DDI 
      potential than other anticoagulants. Enoxaparin and fondaparinux have fewer DDI 
      than others. There was no difference between DOACs. Drug-drug interactions with 
      apixaban and rivaroxaban was independently associated with the absence of CYP3A4 
      competition, P-glycoprotein inhibition, CYP3A4 induction, and drug class of 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Drug-drug interactions with dabigatran and edoxaban 
      was associated with inhibition of P-glycoprotein and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 
      Warfarin, induction of CYP3A4, and inhibition of CYP2C9. Enoxaparin and 
      fondaparinux, only tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Direct oral anticoagulants did not 
      differ regarding DDI with antineoplastic agents. Warfarin presented more DDI than 
      other anticoagulants. P-glycoprotein inhibition and CYP3A4 induction were 
      independently associated with DDI of antineoplastic agents with DOACs.

AB  - Aspirin and P2Y(12) receptor antagonists are widely used across the spectrum of 
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Gastrointestinal complications, 
      including ulcer and bleeding, are relatively common during antiplatelet treatment 
      and, therefore, concomitant proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment is often 
      prescribed. However, potential increased risk of cardiovascular events has been 
      suggested for PPIs, and, in recent years, it has been discussed whether these 
      drugs may reduce the cardiovascular protection by aspirin and, even more so, 
      clopidogrel. Indeed, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies suggested an 
      interaction through hepatic CYP2C19 between PPIs and clopidogrel, which could 
      translate into clinical inefficacy, leading to higher rates of cardiovascular 
      events. The FDA and the EMA sent a warning in 2010 discouraging the concomitant 
      use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole. In addition, whether the use 
      of PPIs may affect the clinical efficacy of the new P2Y(12) receptor antagonists, 
      ticagrelor and prasugrel, remains less known. According to current guidelines, 
      PPIs in combination with antiplatelet treatment are recommended in patients with 
      risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, including advanced age, concurrent 
      use of anticoagulants, steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 
      Helicobacter pylori infection. Like vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), DOACs can 
      determine gastrointestinal bleeding. Results from both randomized clinical trials 
      and observational studies suggest that high-dose dabigatran (150 mg bid), 
      rivaroxaban and high-dose edoxaban (60 mg daily) are associated with a higher 
      risk of GI bleeding as compared with apixaban and warfarin. In patients taking 
      oral anticoagulant with GI risk factor, PPI could be recommended, even if 
      usefulness of PPIs in these patients deserves further data. Helicobacter pylori 
      should always be searched, and treated, in patients with history of peptic ulcer 
      disease (with or without complication). Given the large number of patients 
      treated with antithrombotic drugs and PPIs, even a minor reduction of platelet 
      inhibition or anticoagulant effect potentially carries a considerable clinical 
      impact. The present joint statement by ANMCO and AIGO summarizes the current 
      knowledge regarding the widespread use of platelet inhibitors, anticoagulants, 
      and PPIs in combination. Moreover, it outlines evidence supporting or opposing 
      drug interactions between these drugs and discusses consequent clinical 
      implications.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of dronedarone from clinical trials to real-world evidence: 
      implications for its use in atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1764-1775
LID - 10.1093/europace/euz193 [doi]
AB  - Efficacy and safety of dronedarone was shown in the ATHENA trial for paroxysmal 
      or persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Further trials revealed safety 
      concerns in patients with heart failure and permanent AF. This review summarizes 
      insights from recent real-world studies and meta-analyses, including reports on 
      efficacy, with focus on liver safety, mortality risk in patients with 
      paroxysmal/persistent AF, and interactions of dronedarone with direct oral 
      anticoagulants. Reports of rapidly progressing liver failure in 
      dronedarone-prescribed patients in 2011 led to regulatory cautions about 
      potential liver toxicity. Recent real-world evidence suggests dronedarone liver 
      safety profile is similar to other antiarrhythmics and liver toxicity could be 
      equally common with many Class III antiarrhythmics. Dronedarone safety concerns 
      (increased mortality in patients with permanent AF) were raised based on 
      randomized controlled trials (RCT) (ANDROMEDA and PALLAS), but comedication with 
      digoxin may have increased the mortality rates in PALLAS, considering the 
      dronedarone-digoxin pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction. Real-world data on 
      apixaban-dronedarone interactions and edoxaban RCT observations suggest no 
      significant safety risks for these drug combinations. Median trough plasma 
      concentrations of dabigatran 110 mg during concomitant use with dronedarone are 
      at acceptable levels, while PK data on the rivaroxaban-dronedarone interaction 
      are unavailable. In RCTs and real-world studies, dronedarone significantly 
      reduces AF burden and cardiovascular hospitalizations, and demonstrates a low 
      risk for proarrhythmia in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF. The concerns 
      on liver safety must be balanced against the significant reduction in 
      hospitalizations in patients with non-permanent AF and low risk for 
      proarrhythmias following dronedarone treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the evidence for therapeutic monitoring of 
      antithrombotic drugs in small animals, develop guidelines regarding 
      antithrombotic monitoring, and identify knowledge gaps in the field. DESIGN: 
      First, a standardized, systematic literature review was conducted to address 
      predefined PICO (Population/Patient, Intervention, Control, Outcome) questions, 
      with categorization of relevant articles according to level of evidence and 
      quality. Preliminary guidelines were developed by PICO worksheet authors and the 
      domain chair. Thereafter, a Delphi-style survey was used to develop consensus on 
      guidelines regarding therapeutic monitoring of antithrombotics in dogs and cats. 
      SETTING: Academic and referral veterinary medical centers. RESULTS: PICO 
      questions regarding the utility of therapeutic monitoring were developed for 6 
      different antithrombotic drugs or drug classes, including aspirin, clopidogrel, 
      warfarin, unfractionated heparin, the low molecular weight heparins, and 
      rivaroxaban, The majority of the literature pertaining to therapeutic monitoring 
      of antithrombotic drugs was either performed in experimental animal models of 
      disease or involved studies of drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in 
      healthy laboratory animals. There was a paucity of high level of evidence studies 
      directly addressing the PICO questions, which limited the strength of 
      recommendations that could be provided. The final guidelines recommend that 
      therapeutic monitoring should be performed when using warfarin or unfractionated 
      heparin in dogs and cats at risk of thrombosis. There is insufficient evidence to 
      make strong recommendations for therapeutic monitoring of aspirin or low 
      molecular weight heparin in dogs and cats at this time. CONCLUSIONS: As in other 
      CURATIVE domains, significant knowledge gaps were highlighted, indicating the 
      need for substantial additional research in this field. Ongoing investigation of 
      the role of therapeutic monitoring of antithrombotic therapies will undoubtedly 
      facilitate improved outcomes for dogs and cats at risk of thrombosis.

AB  - Aspirin and P2Y12 receptor antagonists are widely used across the spectrum of 
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Gastrointestinal complications, 
      including ulcer and bleeding, are relatively common during antiplatelet treatment 
      and, therefore, concomitant proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment is often 
      prescribed. However, potential increased risk of cardiovascular events has been 
      suggested for PPIs, and, in recent years, it has been discussed whether these 
      drugs may reduce the cardiovascular protection by aspirin and, even more so, 
      clopidogrel. Indeed, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies suggested an 
      interaction through CYP2C19 between PPIs and clopidogrel, which could translate 
      into clinical inefficacy, leading to higher rates of cardiovascular events. The 
      Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency sent a warning in 
      2010 discouraging the concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or 
      esomeprazole. In addition, whether the use of PPIs may affect the clinical 
      efficacy of the new P2Y12 receptor antagonists, ticagrelor and prasugrel, remains 
      less known. According to current guidelines, PPIs in combination with 
      antiplatelet treatment are recommended in patients with risk factors for 
      gastrointestinal bleeding, including advanced age, concurrent use of 
      anticoagulants, steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 
      Helicobacter pylori infection. Like traditional anticoagulants, novel oral 
      anticoagulants may cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Results from both randomized 
      clinical trials and observational studies suggest that high-dose dabigatran (150 
      mg bid), rivaroxaban and high-dose edoxaban (60 mg daily) are associated with a 
      higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding as compared with warfarin. However, the 
      usefulness of PPIs in patients receiving these anticoagulants deserves to be 
      further demonstrated. Given the large number of patients treated with 
      antithrombotic drugs and PPIs, even a minor reduction of platelet inhibition or 
      anticoagulant effect potentially carries a considerable clinical impact. The 
      present joint statement by ANMCO and AIGO summarizes the current knowledge 
      regarding the widespread use of platelet inhibitors, anticoagulants, and PPIs in 
      combination. Moreover, it outlines evidence supporting or opposing drug 
      interactions between these drugs and discusses consequent clinical implications.

TI  - Effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors used for the treatment of non-small cell 
      lung carcinoma on cytochrome P450 2J2 activities.
PG  - 642-647
LID - 10.1080/00498254.2024.2389401 [doi]
AB  - Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2J2 is responsible for the epoxidation of arachidonic acid, 
      producing epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) that are known to enhance 
      tumorigenesis. CYP2J2 is prominently expressed in the heart and also found in the 
      lungs. Furthermore, the expression level of CYP2J2 in tumour tissues is higher 
      than that in adjacent normal tissues. Non-small cell lung carcinoma is a common 
      cancer, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are powerful tools for its 
      treatment. This study aimed to elucidate the inhibitory effects of 17 TKIs on 
      CYP2J2 activity using LC-MS/MS.Seventeen TKIs exhibited different inhibitory 
      effects on CYP2J2-catalysed astemizole O-demethylation in recombinant CYP2J2. 
      Pralsetinib and selpercatinib showed strong competitive inhibition, with 
      inhibition constant values of 0.48 and 1.1 µM, respectively. They also inhibited 
      other CYP2J2 activities, including arachidonic acid epoxidation, hydroxyebastine 
      carboxylation, and rivaroxaban hydroxylation.In conclusion, we showed that 
      pralsetinib and selpercatinib strongly inhibit CYP2J2 activity. Inhibition of 
      14,15-EET production by these TKIs may be a novel mechanism for suppressing 
      tumour growth and proliferation. Additionally, when these TKIs are 
      co-administered with a CYP2J2 substrate, we may consider the possibility of 
      drug-drug interactions via CYP2J2 inhibition.

TI  - Recanalisation therapies for acute ischaemic stroke in patients on direct oral 
      anticoagulants.
PG  - 534-541
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2020-325456 [doi]
AB  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have emerged as primary therapeutic option for 
      stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, patients may 
      have ischaemic stroke despite DOAC therapy and there is uncertainty whether those 
      patients can safely receive intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. 
      In this review, we summarise and discuss current knowledge about different 
      approaches to select patient. Time since last DOAC intake-as a surrogate for 
      anticoagulant activity-is easy to use but limited by interindividual variability 
      of drug pharmacokinetics and long cut-offs (>48 hours). Measuring anticoagulant 
      activity using drug-specific coagulation assays showed promising safety results. 
      Large proportion of patients at low anticoagulant activity seem to be potentially 
      treatable but there remains uncertainty about exact safe cut-off values and 
      limited assay availability. The use of specific reversal agents (ie, idarucizumab 
      or andexanet alfa) prior to thrombolysis is a new emerging option with first data 
      reporting safety but issues including health economics need to be elucidated. 
      Mechanical thrombectomy appears to be safe without any specific selection 
      criteria applied. In patients on DOAC therapy with large vessel occlusion, 
      decision for intravenous thrombolysis should not delay thrombectomy (eg, direct 
      thrombectomy or immediate transfer to a thrombectomy-capable centre recommended). 
      Precision medicine using a tailored approach combining clinicoradiological 
      information (ie, penumbra and vessel status), anticoagulant activity and use of 
      specific reversal agents only if necessary seems a reasonable choice.

TI  - Impact of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4-interacting drugs on clinical outcomes in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation using non-vitamin K antagonist oral 
      anticoagulants: a nationwide cohort study.
PG  - 722-730
LID - 10.1093/ehjcvp/pvad070 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The clinical relevance of common pharmacokinetic interactions with 
      non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) often remains unclear. 
      Therefore, the impact of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers 
      on clinical outcomes in NOAC-treated patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) was 
      investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: AF patients were included between 2013 and 
      2019 using Belgian nationwide data. Concomitant use of P-gp/CYP3A4-interacting 
      drugs at the time of NOAC initiation was identified. Among 193 072 NOAC-treated 
      AF patients, 46 194 (23.9%) and 2903 (1.5%) subjects concomitantly used a 
      P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, 
      concomitant use of P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors was associated with significantly 
      higher major bleeding [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) (1.18-1.30)] and all-cause mortality risks [aHR 1.07, 95% CI (1.02-1.11)], 
      but not with thromboembolism in NOAC-treated AF patients. A significantly 
      increased risk of major bleeding was observed with amiodarone [aHR 1.27, 95% CI 
      (1.21-1.34)], diltiazem [aHR 1.28, 95% CI (1.13-1.46)], verapamil [aHR 1.36, 95% 
      CI (1.03-1.80)], ticagrelor [aHR 1.50, 95% CI (1.20-1.87)], and clarithromycin 
      [aHR 1.55, 95% CI (1.14-2.11)]; and in edoxaban [aHR 1.24, 95% CI (1.06-1.45)], 
      rivaroxaban [aHR 1.25, 95% CI (1.16-1.34)], and apixaban users [aHR 1.27, 95% CI 
      (1.16-1.39)], but not in dabigatran users [aHR 1.07, 95% CI (0.94-1.23)]. 
      Concomitant use of P-gp/CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. antiepileptic drugs like 
      levetiracetam) was associated with a significantly higher stroke risk [aHR 1.31, 
      95% CI (1.03-1.68)], but not with bleeding or all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: 
      Concomitant use of P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors was associated with higher bleeding and 
      all-cause mortality risks in NOAC users, whereas the use of P-gp/CYP3A4 inducers 
      was associated with higher stroke risks.

TI  - Responsible, Safe, and Effective Use of Antithrombotics and Anticoagulants in 
      Patients Undergoing Interventional Techniques: American Society of Interventional 
      Pain Physicians (ASIPP) Guidelines.
PG  - S75-S128
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interventional pain management involves diagnosis and treatment of 
      chronic pain. This specialty utilizes minimally invasive procedures to target 
      therapeutics to the central nervous system and the spinal column. A subset of 
      patients encountered in interventional pain are medicated using anticoagulant or 
      antithrombotic drugs to mitigate thrombosis risk. Since these drugs target the 
      clotting system, bleeding risk is a consideration accompanying interventional 
      procedures. Importantly, discontinuation of anticoagulant or antithrombotic drugs 
      exposes underlying thrombosis risk, which can lead to significant morbidity and 
      mortality especially in those with coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease. 
      This review summarizes the literature and provides guidelines based on best 
      evidence for patients receiving anti-clotting therapy during interventional pain 
      procedures. STUDY DESIGN: Best evidence synthesis. OBJECTIVE: To provide a 
      current and concise appraisal of the literature regarding an assessment of the 
      bleeding risk during interventional techniques for patients taking anticoagulant 
      and/or antithrombotic medications. METHODS: A review of the available literature 
      published on bleeding risk during interventional pain procedures, practice 
      patterns and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapy 
      was conducted. Data sources included relevant literature identified through 
      searches of EMBASE and PubMed from 1966 through August 2018 and manual searches 
      of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles. RESULTS: 1. There is 
      good evidence for risk stratification by categorizing multiple interventional 
      techniques into low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk. Also, their risk should 
      be upgraded based on other risk factors.2. There is good evidence for the risk of 
      thromboembolic events in patients who interrupt antithrombotic therapy. 3. There 
      is good evidence supporting discontinuation of low dose aspirin for high risk and 
      moderate risk procedures for at least 3 days, and there is moderate evidence that 
      these may be continued for low risk or some intermediate risk procedures.4. There 
      is good evidence that discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy with warfarin, 
      heparin, dabigatran (Pradaxa®), argatroban (Acova®), bivalirudin (Angiomax®), 
      lepirudin (Refludan®), desirudin (Iprivask®), hirudin, apixaban (Eliquis®), 
      rivaroxaban (Xarelto®), edoxaban (Savaysa®, Lixiana®), Betrixaban(Bevyxxa®), 
      fondaparinux (Arixtra®) prior to interventional techniques with individual 
      consideration of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs and 
      individual risk factors increases safety.5. There is good evidence that diagnosis 
      of epidural hematoma is based on severe pain at the site of the injection, rapid 
      neurological deterioration, and MRI with surgical decompression with progressive 
      neurological dysfunction to avoid neurological sequelae.6. There is good evidence 
      that if thromboembolic risk is high, low molecular weight heparin bridge therapy 
      can be instituted during cessation of the anticoagulant, and the low molecular 
      weight heparin can be discontinued 24 hours before the pain procedure.7. There is 
      fair evidence that the risk of thromboembolic events is higher than that of 
      epidural hematoma formation with the interruption of antiplatelet therapy 
      preceding interventional techniques, though both risks are significant.8. There 
      is fair evidence that multiple variables including anatomic pathology with spinal 
      stenosis and ankylosing spondylitis; high risk procedures and moderate risk 
      procedures combined with anatomic risk factors; bleeding observed during the 
      procedure, and multiple attempts during the procedures increase the risk for 
      bleeding complications and epidural hematoma.9. There is fair evidence that 
      discontinuation of phosphodiesterase inhibitors is optional (dipyridamole 
      [Persantine], cilostazol [Pletal]. However, there is also fair evidence to 
      discontinue Aggrenox [dipyridamole plus aspirin]) 3 days prior to undergoing 
      interventional techniques of moderate and high risk. 10. There is fair evidence 
      to make shared decision making between the patient and the treating physicians 
      with the treating physician and to consider all the appropriate risks associated 
      with continuation or discontinuation of antithrombotic or anticoagulant 
      therapy.11. There is fair evidence that if thromboembolic risk is high 
      antithrombotic therapy may be resumed 12 hours after the interventional procedure 
      is performed.12. There is limited evidence that discontinuation of antiplatelet 
      therapy (clopidogrel [Plavix®], ticlopidine [Ticlid®], Ticagrelor [Brilinta®] and 
      prasugrel [Effient®]) avoids complications of significant bleeding and epidural 
      hematomas.13. There is very limited evidence supporting the continuation or 
      discontinuation of most NSAIDs, excluding aspirin, for 1 to 2 days and some 4 to 
      10 days, since these are utilized for pain management without cardiac or cerebral 
      protective effect. LIMITATIONS: The continued paucity of the literature with 
      discordant recommendations. CONCLUSION: Based on the survey of current 
      literature, and published clinical guidelines, recommendations for patients 
      presenting with ongoing antithrombotic therapy prior to interventional techniques 
      are variable, and are based on comprehensive analysis of each patient and the 
      risk-benefit analysis of intervention. KEY WORDS: Perioperative bleeding, 
      bleeding risk, practice patterns, anticoagulant therapy, antithrombotic therapy, 
      interventional techniques, safety precautions, pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with heart disease frequently require anticoagulation for 
      thromboprophylaxis. Current standard of care (SOC), vitamin K antagonists or 
      low-molecular-weight heparin, has significant disadvantages. OBJECTIVES: The 
      authors sought to describe safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and 
      efficacy of apixaban, an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor, for prevention of 
      thromboembolism in children with congenital or acquired heart disease. METHODS: 
      Phase 2, open-label trial in children (ages, 28 days to <18 years) with heart 
      disease requiring thromboprophylaxis. Randomization 2:1 apixaban or SOC for 1 
      year with intention-to-treat analysis. PRIMARY ENDPOINT: a composite of 
      adjudicated major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Secondary endpoints: 
      PK, pharmacodynamics, quality of life, and exploration of efficacy. RESULTS: From 
      2017 to 2021, 192 participants were randomized, 129 apixaban and 63 SOC. 
      Diagnoses included single ventricle (74%), Kawasaki disease (14%), and other 
      heart disease (12%). One apixaban participant (0.8%) and 3 with SOC (4.8%) had 
      major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (% difference -4.0 [95% CI: -12.8 
      to 0.8]). Apixaban incidence rate for all bleeding events was nearly twice the 
      rate of SOC (100.0 vs 58.2 per 100 person-years), driven by 12 participants 
      with ≥4 minor bleeding events. No thromboembolic events or deaths occurred in 
      either arm. Apixaban pediatric PK steady-state exposures were consistent with 
      adult levels. CONCLUSIONS: In this pediatric multinational, randomized trial, 
      bleeding and thromboembolism were infrequent on apixaban and SOC. Apixaban PK 
      data correlated well with adult trials that demonstrated efficacy. These results 
      support the use of apixaban as an alternative to SOC for thromboprophylaxis in 
      pediatric heart disease. (A Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Apixaban 
      Versus Vitamin K Antagonist [VKA] or Low Molecular Weight Heparin [LMWH] in 
      Pediatric Subjects With Congenital or Acquired Heart Disease Requiring 
      Anticoagulation; NCT02981472).
